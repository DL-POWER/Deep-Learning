I love this product  It virtually let s you watch your paid TV anywhere you want  The only thing I wish it did better is improved response time when trying to navigate your cable box 
For the money  you can t beat these speakers  A good friend of mine who works for BB recommended them hands down  He was 100% right  The speakers have a sound quality that rival equipment twice their price  My wife loves the fact that they re hidden away and all my neighbors are jealous of the sound quality I get out of these babies  paired up with a Yamaha receiver  The paintable covers are great  so you can put them in wall if you have access  In wall or in ceiling  you really can t go wrong with these 
Had crucial 16gb and it sucks  bought PNY no problem   run like a charm
Garbage  I want to give this one star  but technically it works so Ill try to be fair  But this is a huge let down  If you have a multi step operation  you need to hold it out like the statue of liberty while all the steps happen to maintain line of sight to all the things its controlling  Sometimes it seems to  misfire  and then i need to turn everything off and try powering it on again  If you switch between activities  it doesnt  clean up  the last activity  so it doesnt always work  The touchscreen is fiddly and the UI is unintuitive  You need to always hit the home button above the touch screen  which is stupid  You can get lost in menus and not know how to get out  The form factor is actually hard to hold AND press buttons  This is one of my least favorite remotes I have ever used  Check out the Companion model   somehow made by the same company and 100x better  Logitech Harmony Companion All in One Remote Control for Smart Home and Entertainment Devices  works with Alexa
A must have with the Surface Pro  It makes a superb tablet a superb computer  Fingerprint scanner works great too  Don t forget to look at the great portable Foldable Mouse to complete this purchase 
Decent set of cheap speakers Not great but you get what you pay for  Better than a cheap off brand from a big box store 
The build quality is amazing  They are so luxurious and you get what you pay for  There are so many other headphones at this price that are plastic junk and these are just what you expect from B W  They sound great and you are able to here so much more in your music 
I should have known by the price this was too good to be true  Although the sound is pretty good for the price there is a MAJOR flaw that I simply cannot live with  One reviewer talked about this and I should have taken his review more seriously  Simply put  this speaker system does not remember what volume setting OR treble and bass settings you put it in EVERY TIME YOU SWITCH SOURCES  That means if you switch from Bluetooth to the input for example  the volume goes up to a default high volume and all the treble and bass settings have to be programmed AGAIN  You have to be kidding me  Add to that when I try to change one thing on the remote it does another  Clearly cheap infrared processor can t distinguish one infrared code from another at times Unless you don t plan on using this with multiple sources then stay away  Sorry but this is one heck of a problem which clearly shows this company does not put enough resources in development and user experience Back in the box to UPS 
As expected from B W  the quality of their products never fail to impress  The audio quality of these are amazing to say the least  Significant improvement over the P5 s in both comfort  look  and most importantly sound 
Good speaker  Right out the box  it starts playing nice  But the recommended app allows you to tweek the highs meds  and lows  bass   and the sounds improves by a lot  Nice speaker  and on sale too  Battery lasts a good while  A week  fully charged  and still playing  I take it everywhere around the house 
This usually works well  but it is sooooo complicated for us old geezers and I get frustrated  often     
Hard to find in the store  One clerk told me they no longer exist  You have to look on the shelfs near checkout  Buy as many as you can 
I like this product  but wish I went with the one with voice command
It s great  Haven t had issue yet  Enjoy the camera and gaming  Color is so  so  so good and brilliant  Use it for fun  business  work  entertainment  and social stuff  Pen work good too  No issues yet  Price could be lower or an incentive offered  but  none was available  Good product  No regrets  yet 
It works    Ya  not that special  I personally hate the lack of left and right buttons  but that s the way the industry has gone for some unknown reason  saves them 35 cents?   In my brief use I had quite a few zoom in gestures occur while attempting to move and click quickly  I m sure they have a way to disable the pinch zoom gesture on the keyboard   the screen is 2 inches away  zoom there Also for the fingerprint  haven t used it once   the facial recognition unlock is quicker and easier with probably a greater degree of accuracy now that it has depth sensing 
Good size and good looking with great sound treble and base
Product performance is good for entry level units 
I haven t owned a ton of stuff by Yamaha over the years  but everything that I have was pretty solid  This will not be the same sound as a high dollar setup but for under  150  I am pleased  Hooked it up to a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Zx SB1506 sound card in my PC  and I am happy as can be  I can tweak it with the cards EQ so I can t tell you what it will do hooked up to a receiver  but I d guess it sounds as good 
Purchased as a gift for a relative  No complaints or issues yet 
Great radio
Great radio
I did not realize how much volume would be lost going from a 2ohm to 4ohm 
they gave me the wrong ram and thank goodness i didnt break my computer 
This is the best Surface keyboard yet  Even better than any other tablet or 2 In 1 keyboard I ve seen or tried  The keys feel great  You don t even realize it s a detachable system it s so natural feeling  Everything feels just right  Smooth track pad with a nice touch  It s just great  Nice color too 
Have been using this remote for about four days  Cost prohibitive to some  but has made using our entertainment center so much easier to use  We went from 8 remotes  down to ONE  It even controls our ceiling fan  GET OUT OF THE CITY  Highly recommended     
Love it  Great sound and I love the Led lights  I would recommend this stereo system to anyone 
At first I thought this would be just a small laptop style speaker set  WOW was I surprised  This has great power and has FM too  Bluetooth is great    For the money this product is a great deal    I am pleased   
I was very impressed with this speaker  It is a great size  It was super easy to connect to my phone  Now for the sound   I was surprised by the power of this speaker  The sound was excellent  I was not expecting it to be so loud  My daughter played some of her music on it and loved the bass  The speaker is very portable  The design is very simple  I like the plus and minus buttons for volume  Excellent product
I ve been using Harmony remotes for many years  I remember when there was no 90 day tech support deadline that s how far back I go  I purchased the new Ultimate One remote and installed the newer on line software  With this  I was able to set my remote up nicely  My old Harmony One worked but not as well as this new remote  My devices responded quicker and if it did not pick up a function the first time  I just selected Help and once it picked up that function  it actually remembered it from then on which the older remote did not do  I also bought the Hub  This is where my problems began  The Hub setup quite nicely with the new remote and actually made the remote work better  especially at longer distances  The only problem  at first  that I encountered was the Wi Fi would not pick up so I called tech support  I have never had an issue with tech support within the 90 days allotted period but after 90 days you better have a credit card they will not help you  fact  Anyway  I was on the phone for over an hour and thirty minutes but they count not get the Hub to work with Wi Fi so they escalated it up to level 2 support  She told me that they would contact me within 24 to 48 hours  That was around 11 30am on a Friday morning  Five days later on Wednesday around 9 05am I called them back requesting level 2 support  They told me that level 2 was busy and that they would call me back in just a few minutes  I heard nothing back that day  The next morning  Thursday  around 9 20am I called back and requested level 2 tech support  Mike told me that they were busy and that he would certainly have them call me back in a few minutes  At that point I told Mike that if level 2 did not call me back  that day  that I would be very upset  Mike said no problem and ended the conversation  Surprise  No call back that day either  So I called back on Friday morning around 10 20am and this time I was a little upset  I spoke to Kevin who read the notes from the day before and said he didn t understand why I was upset because the notes said that the second line tech was out on Thursday and that I was told that they would contact me on Friday  This was news to me  So it appears that Harmony tech support level one write down whatever note covers their butt but not necessarily the truth  Kevin said he would have a 2nd line tech call me right back  I said ok never thinking that I would ever receive a call back but to my surprise CJ called and we were able to start addressing the issues  After blowing out my perfect working remote  Ultimate One  and installing new software  firmware and the remote setup info the remote stopped working properly  The Hub issue was never fixed so I ended up calling Amazon  love Amazon  who offered me a refund or replacement  I actually took the replacement due to the fact that the remote originally worked so well  I am waiting for them to arrive and I will update you on what happens from here                                to be continued
This is GREAT  Having one remote to operate all of my equipment and have it touch screen is really nice 
WOW  I wasn t expecting such a great picture  Easy to set up  Intuitive remote and screen  This was to replace an older Samsung that went off to college  The new design of the base makes it very stable  And WOW what a picture  I read reviews about having to adjust due to the ambient light sensor  But mine s in a dimly lit room and I didn t need to adjust any of the settings 
Great sound and functionality for the purchase price 
I have had several different bluetooth speakers over the years including Anker and Lifepoof  This is my first Ultimate Ears speaker and all I can say is  Wow    Seriously  this speaker is impressive  It is waterproof and drop proof from around 1 meter up  It is solid  fairly heavy  and feels very premium  It has 16 hours of battery life at mid volume and built in wi fi for Alexa use  Let s start with audio quality since that is why you buy a bluetooth speaker  It is nothing short of marvelous in that department  Easily the best sounding bluetooth speaker I have ever heard  Great highs  mids  and very acceptable lows  The two 55mm drivers coupled with the two tweeters do a remarkable job filling a room with clear  musical sound  Plus  this thing gets VERY loud  It easily fills my first floor with sound  Even at max volume there is minimal distortion with bass heavy music which is a real plus  Once you install the app on your mobile device you can get Alexa up and running in no time  I have several Alexa enabled devices in my home ranging from Hue lights and Harmony remote controls to vacuums and sprinkler system  It works them all just like an Echo and the mic easily picks me up from the other side of my house even  albeit at a raised voice   I also have the charging base which is a must in my opinion if you plan to use the Alexa controls as well as keep it portable too  It s a shame the base doesn t come with it for the price Overall  I can t recommend this speaker enough  Yes  it is pricey  but you get what you pay for in this case  Outside of a Sonos speaker  which isn t truly portable  I haven t heard a better battery powered Alexa enabled speaker  bluetooth or not   It really is fantastic 
Wow I am really disappointed in this product  I have owned a Harmony One for about 5 years and it has been really great  It is wearing out and so I decided to replace it with this newer remote  the controls do not seem to be as intuitive to me  It is missing a few key features  the biggest of which is the ability to skip ahead with my DVR  I can fast forward  but not skip ahead What were they thinking I also really dislike the swipe to unlock that you are constantly having to swipe to get to the controls on the screen  I have actually gone back to using my aging Harmony One and this item is now really a decoration  Bummer
Great game and game cards are a necessity  In stock every time at Best Buy 
I fried my remote on my Sony Google TV and the replacement was way too expensive  So I found this wonderful TV and the picture and sound are both better and I can buy a replacement remote for this one very cheap  This TV 2 6 times cheaper than the old TV and much better 
First noise cancelling headphones and I am so impressed  If you consider this a bargain headset your right  Same quality but at a much better price  10 hour battery is right  I am at 8 hours with 30 percent power left  The app is awesome which allows you to set the noise cancel level  In an airport waiting for an announcement set to high and when the loud speaker comes on you hear it  Set to low and nothing except extremely loud noise comes through  Sound quality is good  Boss is better but is  200 over the price of this headset worth it? Only a rich man can tell you but on a budget you get the best of both worlds and right now I love JBL you ROCK 
The sound is clear  The speaker is loud  The batterry lasts a long time depending on how often and how loud you use it  Does need a little more bass though 
ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW  THESE PAIRED UP WITH MY NEW YAMAHA RECEIVER THE SOUND IS AMAZING  DON T HESITATE TO BUY THESE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED 
I have never consideret an adapter untill now works awesome  lot better then I expected  worth every dollar  my son use the adaptor for gaming I have 150to170mbps cabel internet from Comcast this adapter is able to pool 120to130 most ot the time my son is happy camper  was gone do additional cabel to his room but now I think no more 
This was recommended by my Best Buy  Geek Squad in home advisor  I tested it out in the store and was very happy about the level of performance at a good price  Black won t show rust like the white  2 months and they re holding up well  Great sound and projection 
Returned  Too bad     very programmable  Would turn off devices at the wrong time  Setup used to make sure the option wasnt set but still had issues  Too many hoops to jump through to get simple operations correct If you have minimal setup then this might be perfect for you  Just not for me this time 
Not cheap but worth the month  great sound 
What a pain in the butt       would not recommend 
I installed this on my  09 Harley Street Glide  This is my second Sony marine radio  the first lasted about 3 years  This newer model is easier for me to use because the buttons are larger  It s not easy pushing tiny buttons while riding with gloves  I also have a module that allows me to control some functions using the bike s hand grip controls  and I have a Sirius  XM unit attached  It sounds decent and looks good  especially at night with the blue lights  The reason I m giving it only 3 stars is that on occasion  the volume changes on it s own  It will randomly raise all the way up to 50  full volume   other times it will drop down very low  I can t figure out why it happens  but at least it doesn t happen all of the time  so I m learning to live with it for now 
Great purchase if your looking to extended the life of your MacBook Pro just a little longer  My MacBook had 4gb of of ram so I used this to double it and combined it with a cheap Solid State Drive and the computer runs significantly better 
Im not sure Ive ever purchased a piece of electronics that Ive found to be this pathetically bad  It definitely bucks the commonly held belief that more expensive models from the same manufacturer MUST be better  This may work for some but Im an experienced tech owner and I think its junk I could list all the reasons I hate it but that would mean Im throwing my time away along with my money If you are looking for a good Logitech universal I BEG you to pass this one by  They make less expensive and vastly better units 
Glorified on and off cant do Bluetooth or radio remote Polk audio  had to keep my Comcast and Samsung remotes sitting next to me with In a hour knew I had made a mistake in buying the remote
I own a Surface Pro 3 and purchased this keyboard because of the touch id    hello feature  This cover keyboard is also better then the Pro 3 original keyboard  It fits great 
had 2 Harmony 1100 s  spilt wine on the first   liked them but found fast forwarding a pain  especially when having to time pressing play at the end of adverts  also the display output would keep flipping upside down  Ultimate One fixes that plus several other nice touches  Some complain about the fast forward being at top of remote  I see the point but doesn t bother me enough  hopefully Logitech will continue to invest in their remotes 
This is a quality product    as it should be for the price  I bought it to replace a Harmony 680 that failed after six months of use  As compared to the 680  the buttons are far better  solid rather than spongy and  on the single function buttons  a clear clicky feel  though silent  when acturated  I understand the complaints of users who prefer buttons over touch screen controls or find it clumsy to operate with one hand  but neither is a concern for us  In fact  touch screen control is very similar to a smartphone my somewhat technophobic wife found it easier to learn than the button controlled 680 I m using the unit without the hub  since we already have an IR integrator that controls all the devices from a single sensor under our wall mounted TV  The IR output seems very strong and  unlike the standard Time Warner remote  doesn t have to be close to and aimed directly at the sensor The device worked properly after the basic activity setup using the Windows software downloaded from the Logitech website  However  I soon discovered that it s even better after customization  Going beyond things like setting up favorite channels is not a job for the faint hearted some computer expertise is needed  Also  the complete user manual should be downloaded from the Logitech website before attempting a more detailed customization Unlike the 680  I found it unnecessary to add commands for the individual devices that were omitted from the basic setup  On the other hand  the ability to fine tune the delay and switching times for each device was a big plus  With the 680  IR output continued for a much longer time than it took to activate the devices  This was a real nuisance  If  say the TV had been set at a high volume when it was turned off  and if a low volume was needed when turning it back on  I had to wait as much as 5 seconds with the TV blaring until I could access the volume control    not good if someone was asleep in the next room For me the need for a charging cradle is a plus  It sits on my nightstand next to the bed  is always handy and fully charged  and doesn t disappear into the bedding  onto the floor  into a nightstand drawer  or onto some other piece of bedroom furniture where I wouldn t think of looking for it My only uncertainty about this remote is its longevity  which I can t comment on because it s still fairly new  I ve used Logitech keyboards and trackballs for many years and have always found them very reliable  After the failure of my 680 I m just a bit nervous and hoping for a better experience with the Ultimate One 
So far so good  Very easy install with all of the features we typically use on the boat  Clean interface and puts out great sound 
Awesome outdoor speakers if you re looking for durability  Price is great also 
I like the fact that you can link more bluetooth speakers and create a surround sound   very decent range too
Great sound  quality product  Product came nicely packaged with detailed installation instructions  I have been a long time Definitive enthusiast so I had high hopes for these speakers  These speakers do not disappoint I mounted them horizontally on the ceiling of our patio  which is just vinyl siding covering up the ceiling joists  We added  studs  between the joists so we could mount them onto solid wood  I put rubber washers between the bracket and the vinyl and there is no rattling or vibration of the siding  The design of the bracket makes for easy adjustment to ensure a straight and level installation  I mounted the bracket 7  from the wall  There is not much clearance between the speaker and the bracket so using banana plugs for the wires makes for a tight fit  Connected the speakers to Zone 2 of a Denon 2307  using an Apple Airport Express to play music from our iOS devices  The patio is 30x15 with another 50ft stretching out for the pool area   these speakers fill the whole space with crisp sound even when only using a moderate volume  We are extremely satisfied and would recommend these speakers to anyone who is sound quality conscious and looking to improve their outdoor space  You get what you pay for  and these are worth the money 
Great headphones  Comfort level is great and the notice cancellation is awesome
I got my speaker to listen to music when entertaining company and cooking outside  This speaker packs a lot of volume and the optional bass feature is nice too 
The keyboard has worked perfectly and the touchID is very useful when I am in the middle of projects and keep logging in and out of my surface  Also the key are backlite which is a plus in the dark 
was looking for shelf stereo love the colorful lights  sound is crisp and loud  easy to put together 
i live away from sports teams I follow  I put the sling box on a spare TV in a family members house so I can keep up with sports teams  The new model allows me to broadcast to my roku from my phone  The only reason it s not 5 stars is that it techs a minimal amount of tech savvy to set up
I needed something to connect my Android phone to be able to talk hands free and didn t want to spent much because the car is a beater  I didn t expect much  especially with it being at one of the lowest price points  but I ve been very surprised  First  from what my friends tell me  they can t even tell I m driving  and my car is LOUD   so the bluetooth  cell call feature is fantastic  Music plays great  good volume with nothing added  Easy installation with a cheap kit off the web  just need a soldering iron and electrical tape  Took 45 minutes to install with videos off YT If you can live without a CD player  it s worth a try 
Compared to all the speakers in its class it is cheaper and much better 
This remote is cool  all my friends think I m rich because my remote has a touch screen  My parents think it is cool that my remote has an iphone on it  All that aside  it works magnificently 
Took a little getting used to but works great  I was familiar with the online setup from my other Harmony remote  I was up and running in about 15 minutes 
I bought this to use on my desktop computer  which is not near my router  With the router in the basement  this adapter gives my desktop my full internet speed  Looks cool  and does the job well 
Pounding Base  awesome clarity  good value and lots of fun
I tried  tested about twenty different Bluetooth speakers from multiple brands and this one was at the top  It was between this one and a bose speaker but at half the cost of the bose this speaker was a no brainer 
GOOD BAG FOR a 70 200 mm lens and a prime lens and a camera body 
My Netgear Nighthawk AC3200 Router sits on the main floor at one end of my house  My office is in the basement at the other end of the house  I have an older laptop that could only do 2 4GHz  802 11g protocol  I bought this companion Netgear USB adapter  I went from 18Mbps to 88Mbps and I m sure it can do more  that s just the limit of my current ISP  This is a rock solid network adapter  If you have a router that does 802 11n or ac with a 5GHz radio  then this is a excellent upgrade for an older laptop  desktop  I ll be switching to 1 gigabit fiber optic soon  Can t wait to see what speed I get 
There are very few things these days that are worth every penny  This pair of headphones is one of them  The sound quality is as good as all the other reviews indicate so I won t re create the wheel  I have tinnitus and sometimes it s difficult for me to hear the TV or stream a TV show or movie without having to turn the sound up  probably why I have tinnitus   I live in a condo and playing music  TV or movies loud is not an option  These headphones help to focus the sound to my ears rather than the whole room let alone the building  I don t have to play them loud to enjoy the sound or hear the words  They tend to get a little snug but not so much as to outweigh the overall sound quality  As for the quality of construction and materials  you get what you pay for  The leather is soft and supple  not plasticy or sticky on the skin  The metal parts are well made and give the headphones a very nice appearance and feel  And finally  I have a big fat head  I gave away my Beats  Monster headphones because they were too tight on my head  These headphones have plenty of room for my massive cranium and are comfortable to wear for the length of a movie I LOVE MY HEADPHONES      
This is my 4th and best Logitech remote  It does everything my other 3 did all in one and sooooooo smooth  It excels were other remotes do not  It distances itself by sending signals through the remote itself and the hub  meaning you can control anything from any room not just what devices are located around the hub  I just love it    
Phenomenal product  At first I was a little worried that going from four remotes to one would be difficult  but the software was very intuitive and took maybe 10 minutes to set up  By far the easiest remote I ve ever had to program  The lack of batteries also is a huge plus  So far I ve recommended this to multiple peoplme  and if you re considering buying this  do it  You will not regret it  It may be on the high side for a remote control  but it is worth every penny 
Stay away from this remote  It is almost impossible to change channels  When you select a channel  say 1210  it may put 12 or just 1  You cannot directly enter a channel number on this remote  Lastly  one time it turns devices on an off  then other times it does not  I have had Harmony remotes in the past which were far superior  Maybe it was a defective unit  Suffice to say  I returned to Besr Buy and got a refund 
worst remote on the planet you d be lucky to get 2 days charge out of the pos it s constantly not turning devices on and if you accidently drop it screen will crack in a heartbeat  worst remote logitech ever made  
I had a Harmony universal remote prior to this one and it was great  This remote is very inconsistent and not user friendly  I ve had Geek Squad out four times and they can t seem to fix it  I m planning on returning or exchanging 
Sorely disappointed  Constantly sends two clicks when you ve only clicked once   to any device  This remote refuses to manage my Cisco DVR  supplied by TimeWarner  completely   you have to open the DVR as a device  select the button you want and then it will work   i e  it wont use the device in a macro  Also  only Power Toggle works  Power On or Power Off does not  WAY WAY WAY too easy to click the touch screen when you re laying the remote down  necessitating picking it up again correcting what changed when you put it down 
Worst customer service of any Tech company on the market  I bought this Logitech remote about a year ago and it worked fine for about a year  after that one day is displayed an error message saying that it cannot connect to hub and wouldn t work anymore  I called customer service and tried to troubleshoot the issue after being on a phone for over an hour the tech support representative told me that there is a hardware issue with the remote and i would need to replace it  Assuming that Logitech would stand behind their product i proceeded to give the tech support representative my information to send me a replacement remote  however he informed me that I would have to buy a new remote and they would not be able to warranty my current one  just one year ago i spent over 300 on this remote so that I could do it again a year later NO THANK YOU I would never buy Logitech again and if you are smart you shouldn t do it either P s I spoke to the customer service manager  Marvin  who was extremely unhelpful and wouldn t care for Logitech or its customers 
Product did not work right out of the box  Unfortunately I installed it outside of the return window so it was a total loss 
I bought this to replace my old 10 year old Slingbox  This product is inferior  When watching via mobile  the signal will give out and go black after several minutes and not come back unless I close and restart the program  When watching at home using a laptop on the same network  the signal won t disappear completely    it will just go to a black screen every several minutes  but then continue streaming after a few seconds  Super annoying and I didn t have any of these issues with the old Slingbox  Plus there are ads on this Slingbox so I have to watch the ads again every time I restart because their signal is so poor 
good signal  works great  very useful device and helps a lot
Works  Seems overpriced for what it is  However  does work as advertised 
Geek squad set it up for me and left detailed instructions as it is not the most used set in the house 
Works wonderfully  pairs with the Harmony Hub and is a nice upgrade  Battery only lasts for a few days but I put it on the charger every other day  No problem 
I use this to control 4 devices and it does so well 
These tapes are specific for my video recorder and result in clear videos that are easy to copy to dvd 
We only have hot spots at work  We needed this to access the Internet  I can access the Internet most of the time 
Setting up this remote to my Pioneer ELITE was easy as 123 
Works well  Doesn t switch from one application to the other  like from video game to streaming   Have to hit the off button  let everything turn off first then select the new application 
Purchased this instead of having a cable box in the kitchen  So far it works well  but the are some quirks  It can be a little temperamental the when it comes to setting it up with the Xfinity X1 platform  The guide won t load all the channels and the app itself does need a little work  especially if you buy the app at  15 
Touchpad is slightly less accurate than would be expected  However  overall a great addition to the MS4 device 
This is a nice attached keyboard for the Surface Pro 4  It protects the screen when traveling and is a fully functional keyboard at the same time  I haven t had any issues with fingerprint reader  either 
Works well  Only issue is the remote signal doesn t reach very far at all  maybe 2 3 ft max  The unit itself has been great so far 
My gaming laptop kept dropping Wifi connection  so I bought this Netgear adapter  Installation was a breeze  the adapter works well and I no longer get random disconnects in the middle of a boss fight  It s on a larger side  I wouldn t recommend it as a portable device  But for a stationary computer it s excellent 
Bought this to replace a broken Harmony One remote  The new My Harmony application works better than the Harmony website  You can store multiple remotes in the application  Remote has fewer hard buttons  but double functions for those  momentary  and hold  Battery life is more like 4 days over the prior 7 days  Has gesture controls on separate screen for thing like changing channels and volume  You define activities such as Watch TV or play Xbox  then program the tethered remote with the new instructions  Some corrections can be made on the remote itself 
I had a prior version of this remote which was showing its age  so I decided to buy this new version  It is smaller and charges in an upright stand  It takes up less space  which is a benefit  The remote is a little awkward to handle at first  but I ve gotten used to it for most features  The one item I wish were different was easier access to a numeric keypad to go to a channel on my satellite receiver box  The numeric keypad is there  just takes a couple clicks to get it showing 
The Slingbox M2 works as advertised  You ll need to download the free app for your phone or tablet  I would have given it 5 stars  except the M2 could not authenticate using the wireless mode with WPA2 Personal encryption and a long wifi password   Mine is over 50 characters   Short passwords worked  but are less secure  and in my case  I was unwilling to change the passwords on all my other wireless devices to accommodate this design defect  So  I elected to connect the M2 via an ethernet cable instead 
So far I ve been pretty happy with the purchase  but found out after purchasing it  it does not have the capability to output 5 1 sound when streaming  I also had some issues when using Ethernet instead of wifi  Usually Ethernet is more reliable and faster  but that is not the case with my slingbox  I m not sure if it is hardware or software  but I dropped connection all the time when using Ethernet  so I went back to using wifi and it works fine again 
Purchased as gift for daughter to use with Amazon Fire and she loves it 
The Geek squad set this up for me with my new TV and existing sound system  In general works well  however not all devices accurately tune in as programed  There is an easy way to properly connect  however it is a bit awkward for those not technically savvy 
Needed a very slim full motion mount that would support our 60 inch flat screen and this one did the job  Easy to install  Unsure how it will perform after excessive movement  too soon to report  For now  flat screen has been set in proper position and we have not had the need to change angle or move it back  Would recommend Sanus as a good brand for large flat screen mounts 
Installed in an enclosure  hooked up to my iMac works great as a Time Machine drive 
Battery life is a bit short compared to our former 1100 model  Went dead after 2 days off the charging base  minimal use 
This works well and does what is intended but it s too big for a laptop  I upgraded my laptop and noticed that the NIC was too slow  Instead of upgrading the NIC card  i went this route  This works well but is too big for a mobile laptop user  
I needed some working ram in a hurry and they had it in my local store  Works well and looks good 
This works well  Sometimes if you don t aim properly at devices it may mess up but it easy to fix by pressing the help button
This worked well until we updated our iPad to 10   then it would not play on our TV   we had to change to control it with an iPhone that has not been updated
Bought to use on a budget gaming PC  Works well in a pinch  A bit pricey for the speed 
Great picture sound not as good but still works very well 
Great product harder to set up then I had planned 
Had the Geek Squad install on my new system  very pleased
I really like having a keyboard to enhance my tablet use  This fits the bill  I would prefer a 10 key extension  but for an extra computer  it is not a huge issue 
Installed well  installed well  happy with purchase
It works well  however  there is nothing special about it 
Remote works well but the buttons take some getting use to  The placement could be better  Easy to set up 
This works great  I�ve not had any lagging when online gaming and video streaming 
very user friendly  works well with the new cable boxes 
Works well as both as a pass trough outlet and back up battery for your phone or tablet  Haven t had much use so i can t speak to the 3000Mah power claim  Overall a good product  
Does what it�s supposed to based on the description 
I bought this to replace the onyx  original  that we had  Works with existing wiring kit which is awesome   no rerunning of wires 
I like how it tilts horizontal  vertical  and extends  We can watch from different rooms with ease and adjust for kids 
I needed this for work to tape a meeting to upload for other employee viewers  Other than that it s just a tape does what it s intended for and a great job at it  No remorse nor stress from it 
Is pretty loud for the size and works as advertised 
My son has enhanced wireless connectivity with his computer gaming  He doesn�t complain anymore about the WiFi 
No issues  It is pretty loud and  so far anyway  keeps a charge for a long time 
This is a good product to purchase if you re looking to expand the memory of your laptop for a decent price  To do so for video editing  more powerful tasks the 16GB would be better  but for everything else this is a good size to go with 
Works well with Direct TV  Relatively easy to set up 
My laptop s internal wireless adaptor died  and I purchased this after researching my options  It works very well  no problems  I dislike how bulky it is  but I wasn t willing to sacrifice functionality for size 
Another solid product from Sanus  Their mounts just work well  Designed well and operate as marketed  I have an 80  TV on this baby so I am putting it through the ultimate test  No connection issues 
Absolutely satisfied with the performance  Easy setup and use 
Excellent choice for a condo  Works very well  Reception is great
It us very easy to use   move the TV but it doesn t come out far enough to get a wide angle
This works nicely and has enough adjustments that it can be made to replace probably any remote you have  But you have to consider several things before buying It takes a while to set up you need patience  But you should have to set it up only once The touch screen is small and unless your fingers are very small  it can be very clumsy to use You have to use two hands to operate the remote for most functions Support is willing but not very knowledgeable  put another way  it does not pass the Turing Test The design has a variety of other quirks that will matter to some and not to others For example  I  like a number of other folks  wrote in that the backlight for the buttons turns back on after the unit had been on the charger or a while After a week dealing with Support  during which time I was told the problem would be fixed and I was told to reset  reboot  update firmware  which was already the latest version   create new accounts  re setup the units from scratch  provide additional info and was given incorrect instructions on how to change settings  and then I was told that the problem was bumped up to the next higher level of Support  after all that I was told that the behavior is a nomral function  that the backlight is supposed to come on after the unit has been on the charger for a few hours It took a week for support to figure out that the behavior was normal function What kind of management does not supply Support with with proper information or provides it with believable answers It of course WAS NOT normal function and the programmers corrected the issue in a subsequent firmware update  but no thanks to the Support contractor  thanks go instead to the Logitech Technician that was watching the Logitech forums If you can live with all that  and are well healed  this might be an effective way to cut down on all those remotes  You can Use the one remote in place of all the others  generally  without having to think about which settings to use  For example  if you want to watch TV The Harmony remembers which devices you have and howe they are setup  connected to each other and works accordingly 
dont need to program   keeps all my settings for me 
It s really nice that you can hook up iPad  iPod and phone to use wireless 
Once set up the slingbox works well  The instructions for setup were poor  Customer service was helpful 
I was a little nervous about buying this remote given several negative reviews  I m very glad I found the courage to buy it because it is  without question  the best remote I have ever owned  I wanted to control the following devices * Sony KDL 46HX850 TV* Sony BDP S570 Blu ray player* Sony STR DN2010 surround amp* Apple TV  3rd Gen * ATT STB   Motorola VIP 1200* Bang Olufsen Beocenter 2300* Lutron Light   MIR 600THW* Dyson AM05   Hot and cold fanIt took about an hour or so playing with it  which was fun in itself  to learn how to configure the remote as I wanted it  I now have it exactly as I could have ever hoped for  I have it configured for the following activities * Watch ATT U verse* Watch Apple TV* Watch Blu ray* Listen to BO* Turn on  off and adjust lights* Turn on  off and adjust Dyson fanMoving from one activity to another is as simple as it gets and remote powers down all devices that were in use by the previous activity  when appropriate to do so   The vibration feedback deals with any concerns I had about using the remote without directly looking at it  Picking up the remote switches on the color screen  which switches off shortly after the remote is put down  The remote feels really good in the hand and it is very clear that Logitech put a lot of effort into the ergonomics of the unit On the negative side  the laptop software appears buggy  I use a Macbook Air with Yosemite and I had to reboot both the Mac and the remote several times as I went through the learning and configuration process  Some work here for Logitech All in all this is an excellent product  That I can now box up 5 other remote controls is a dream come true 
I suggest checking Lenovo s site for actual compatibility information  As long as your unit is compatible with this charger  it will work like a charm  Keep in mind too that this is an OEM item that is unlikely to damage your unit from use 
I love this external keyboard  This turns the Surface Pro into a laptop  I only wish the material it is made from were easier to clean 
great add on for the surface pro  the bio logon feature works great 
Works perfectly  The only complaint I have is the usb and mount are too shout it needs a longer cable  When you pull in any direction it falls over 
My laptop only has a 2 4 network and this dongle gave me a strong 5 wifi network with no problems 
This works as expected  Microsoft has really taken the tablet and its accessories to the next level  Lighted keys would be welcome back though
Hard to set up and doesn t always run all of my devices 
The RAM works just as it should  When installed correctly  it starts working at the moment of startup  Very helpful in general multitasking and especially in video and image editing  This product was very helpful in making my computer run more efficiently 
Works like I expected  Has all the functionality that I expected 
I built my RVs sound system around this car stereo  I needed the features it has  nothing more  and so far  not disappointed  Not the most powerful head unit out there  but plenty for the RV  Love the BlueTooth connectivity  Worked with my Android Note3 with little problem The sub outs will be perfect for the addition of a powered Bass speaker in the future I use the AUX in to pump the sound from the TV into the RV system  The antenna on the RV sucks  but the unit was still able to pull in enough stations through that antenna  at the various camp sites  to keep us happy For the price  can t be beat 
Needed memory upgrade for client TODAY  This was the only DDR3 memory available in a local store  Even though it is designed for a MAC it worked perfectly well in 2012 Dell Latitude 5530  Client now happy with 8G RAM  End of story 
Works well  makes it easier to sign on  I would recommend this to someone that wants ease of use 
Bought one for my BF for his birthday and when he set it up  we couldn t get past the remote config  After looking online I found out it was an issue and the only way to solve it was to bring it back to the store and get a new one  so we did  Had some troubles returning it because the kid did not complete the process and when we followed up  we were told that it never went through so took more time to get  Once we got the new one it worked great right out of the box 
Easy to use and works very well  I would highly recommend this product 
Works great  Instructions were not clear that you MUST insert the rechargeable batteries into the unit and use the adapter  or the unit does not work  Instructions gave the impression that using the adapter was an option  For the price of the unit I was surprised that batteries were not included  Very satisfied with the performance of this Ameriphone SR2000 Super Loud Telephone Ringer 
Sleak style  Love it  Was able to sync to my prior harmony remote  Easy
The slingbox is easy to hookup  The only problem was reaching the company web site  Everytime I try to get help from the web site I couldn t get thought  I still got the slinkbox to work  I would have given five stars if I could connect to the web site 
Easy to use does not require wires can accomodate multiple devices
I m having to get used to a smaller keyboard than what I m used to  On the upside the surface pro 4 can switch between laptop and tablet in an instant 
This remote did all that I asked of it  Was able to run all my devices in one remote  Touch screen made it easy to set all devices as needed for desired operation  Programming was easy with laptop  But after a week of use and simplification of my home theater system  I came to realize that on a daily basis my cable remote would suffice and could not rationalize spending that kind of money on something that I would use its potential only occasionally 
Great product  l would recommend to all that would like to watch your cable tv away from home 
Works as advertised and is a great concept  Issue I have is my internet connectivity where I am viewing from  Not an issue for the product just a heads up you want good connectivity or the feed will be jerky and or have interruptions 
I purchased the Harmony Smart Control  hub   remote  when it was on sale  and loved NOT having the touchscreen  The problem with this setup for me though  was it did not have the IR built into the remote  which I needed for my TV  too far away from hub or IR blasters   I ended up purchasing this remote  which is much more deluxe  but I personally like having the numerical buttons available at all times and find that whatever is on the screen is not what I want on the screen  I m sure I ll get it all setup the way I wanted  but so far  my wife has had issues using it  She s not great with electronics  but she s been  stuck  when things freeze up or are not working correctly 
Really impressed with the range it has and I haven�t had any issues with it   I use it for WOW  worlds of Warcraft  and have no problem 
Fantastic  Super fast logins  No more passwords  Windows  Hello 
It combines all my electronics into one changer  No more millions of changers everywhere 
Works great for presentations in which I need more volume than my laptop is able to provide 
Bought as a gift and they re been very happy with it  I feel the Harmony software has come a long way from what it was  They re much easier to program 
Bought this for my teenage son for his new computer  Works great 
Easy self installation  works great  My 2013 MacBook Pro no longer overheats and there is virtually no more lag  A few dollars really made a noticeable change 
Easy to install and works great  We had an older one and upgraded and both have been wonderful products 
Easy way to get all of your devices on one remote 
Great product 
I have used previous place shifting devices and I must say this new one from Sling is the best  It was super easy to setup and the quality of the video is amazing  I now am able to watch my TV on my phone and  cast  it to my 55 inch TV with great quality 
I purchased these memory modules to upgrade my VR ready PC  Good value for the money  40 years ago I purchased memory for a  computer  at 1977 prices these 16 Gb would have cost  356 000 000 so  134 was a good price   
I used the component connection from my cable box to the SlingBox and again from the SlingBox to the TV Previously I had connected my cable box to the TV using an HDMI cable  For whatever reason my TV picture improved significantly  Could have been a poor HDMI cable as I was using what Comcast supplied Love the SlingBox  Great picture on my iPhone and iPad  We use the iPad as a remote TV when we re working around the house  I watch TV on my phone while in the parking lot when my wife is shopping 
I used to have to tone out my girlfriend  but with the JBL NXTGen Technology  I can simply put these on and it does all of the work for me  Now  I don t have to pretend to listen  I just don t  So many arguments have been avoided  Would definitely recommend to anyone 
I was able to utilze the sling box app on my phone and hook it up to an HDMI cord available in our caravan  I had to purchase an adapter from the Apple Store  connecting iPhone to HDMI outlet   The kids no longer have to watch the same DVDs on road trips  This product works great 
Makes it quick and easy to log onto the surface  Another opportunity to forget another password 
My son bought this for a pc he was building   works as advertised   great price 
nice keyboard  It hardly adds any weight to the surface pro and allows me to type efficiently while staying comfortable  The fingerprint scanner is nice and works every time 
Was using the Harmony app with my mobile devices and decided to try the remote  Works great 
We love using one remote for all our devices associated with the tv  Very convenient 
We really enjoy the Kingbox  We re able to watch our Directv shows from a remote location
Works great for what I need it for  just wish it had a power off  on switch 
Great speakers  I have a set at both our home and our camp powered by Sonos connect Amps  Sound deep and clear with plenty of power 
Selection of the numbers screen yields difficulty  Numbers will not select when pressed most of the time 
I bought this mainly because it has built in integration with Chromecast audio  meaning it seamlessly connected to my Google Home  It sounds pretty good given its size 
works great wired or wireless  Great battery life 
CPU  Ryzen 7 1700 Mobo  Asus Rog Strix B350 F SSD  PNY 250GHz PSU  Corsair 750W and this 16GB of RAM and I officially have myself a gaming computer  Thanks for all of your help Extremenetwork   You can see the two sticks of blue colored RAM just to the right of the heat sink fan in the attached photo 
Took a bit to figure out all the options but once we got it configured it works great on my home theater    even my wife is able to work it
Enjoying it   the sound is good and it does not take up a lot of space
Works great not perfect always better to use wire plug but if you have to use Wi Fi this works good from best buy
All around great speaker sounds even better and tight close areas 
Been using it for 2 months now  Works great in all regards  Some of the custom built in features are excellent  Interface with computer download is easy and works wonderfully  Instructions are spot on  and easy to follow  My only complaint is that for all its  techiness  and design beauty  once you get past the main menu  the sub menu of devices is like something out of a 1980s Atari game     black and white    cheap looking  This does urk me  as you have to access the device submenu every time you want to switch which device you are controlling 
Easy to install and operate  Works great with a computer or our mobile devices   
The jetpack works great for what I need   easy Internet access for devices  We have had no problems with it at all so all seems fine  Thanks 
Works well  Love it  Much better than what I had previously
I never thought I could get excited over a remote control  but I did with this one  First of all  let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon  but I took the plunge and so far I m not regretting it  This is my first Harmony remote  so I obviously can t make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software  That was a breeze  but it s important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other  All my components were supported by the remote  so no problems there  I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen  A nice touch  though not very important Once the first sync from software to remote is completed  the remote will work on your system  As opposed to the previous situation  where you had four remotes lying around  you will now hit one button   activity   and your TV  AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once  Great  At first this does not work flawlessly  For instance  you hit  Watch TV  and everything might come on  but the AV receiver won t be on the right channel  The great thing about this remote  though  is that it learns on the job  It will ask you if the function performed as desired  and if not  how it can improve  After my initial use with every component  these flaws were pretty much ironed out  I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you ve been fooling around with your equipment behind its back  Turned off your TV by hand using that device s own power button The Harmony doesn t know  so when you switch everything off through the remote  again  just ONE button   your TV will come back on again  You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on  off buttons for the individual components  You ll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity  so there s an initial time investment involved  And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote  so you ll have to memorize everything  All in all this is not ideal If you want to nitpick  a few other minor cons are  1  the sluggish touchscreen and 2  slightly flimsy buttons  This is nothing I can get worked up about None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement  I m very happy with this product  I m still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and  subsequently  the longevity of this remote  Time will tell  and I ll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so  So far I d highly recommend it  Great product 
I love this produxt because my phone usually dies toward the end of the day and I am rarely around a plug in  I can charge my phone where ever I am with this handy little device 
The 6X8 size is an odd one  but that is what the older Ford Rangers have from the factory  I replaced those 4 with 4 of these  along with a new JVC deck  These things sound great 
easy to setup works great  used for gaming with no problem
Plenty of nice features especially the finger print function for security 
I bought this on the recommendation of my daughter  It has replaced our coffee table mess of six different remotes with only one  It has a learning curve to problem solving  but if you are somewhat techno savvy  you should be OK  I do not know if my non techno savvy husband could have set this up since it requires an online setup  He has  however  learned to use it and is delighted with how it works 
Came very fast and works fast  Glad that it was cheaper 
I had to buy an hdmi to rca jack adapter since my set top box had only hdmi  The instructions for the adapter were not correct BUT the tech people at Sling Box got it working  Very knowledgeable   unfortunately the GEEK squad was not a lot of help  Once online it works great  Also much easier to use with ipad app vs the iphone app 
It was so easy to set up and the unit works great  It works with all my units and controls them perfectly 
The Slingbox M2 works great as long as you have a wired connection or good steady wi fi on your streaming device  Unfortunately  when used in an apartment complex with severe wi fi interference  the signal tends to drop out  and the connection needs to be restored or restarted  As this is no longer an issue for me  the device is working great  but buyer beware 
I got this because it was the only one in stores  but got a great deal on it  The fingerprint reader is very useless to me because of the face scanner and pin number security on the tablet 
Been using one for 4 years now love the selection an sound 
Easy to set up and allows us to watch our pet when away from home
Easy to set up  and can control just about everything  except the PS4  but that is on Sony not logitech   Battery last a good long while  but occasionally the remote will hang up when turning everything off which causes the battery to drain  However I did find there is an easy way to fix this 
Got this to replace an older harmony and it works great  It was very easy to set up since it just took the configuration of my old harmony and used that for the new one 
I love the way it sounds and the extra bass button  however i wish you could turn off the lights  If the lights would blink in Rhythm with the songs  that would be awesome 
I use this on multiple devices works great  Would recommend it 
Purchased the jet pack to use when we go on vacation or travel  It works well with 5  electronics connected to the device  Make sure you turn the device off when it is not being used 
Set up and working like a charm  Would have been 5 stars but I just started using it  No problems at all though  Seems well worth it 
Solved my memory issues and allowed me to resolve my download issues  Easy to use 
Sturdy  flexiable and operates well from all angles in the room 
This equipment worked as planned for the computer I was working on
This is a great pack for the beginner and professionals  It all comes down to the purpose it is used for  For me always on the go this pack works great  I have plenty of room for my two cameras a couple lenses and the rest of my needed gear batteries etc 
This product is really good had it for about a month now
We use it on our deck by our pool  Sounds great  Very easy to use and sync to IPhone 
Worked great in my laptop  Was basically just plug and play 
Works great to watch your own tv while out  I use at work
Works well with my surface 4 pro  Fingerprint reader has come in handy 
Dog ate my old one  Easily synced to old hub  Use IR with tv and RF for all other components 
easy install and easy to use
Easy to set up  Works as advertised  Able to watch my shows anywhere anytime  All I need is an internet connection 
Great for live streaming sports very happy to have it
Great quality  Works as expected  Ordered online and it was a quick and easy checkout in store 
I use it at my office perfect size fits well under monitor  great sound quality  easy hook up 
Incredible device works great to stream anything from your home cable  satellite service 
It s a great product very easy to use and mount to wall 
Met my gaming needs  I am an all day online gamer and this mouse works great 
My mother didn t necessarily need a louder ringer but rather a lower pitch  This worked wonderfully and I would recommend it 
Needed a wireless unit for the main cpu in the upstairs area  Works great 
No complaints  If you can get it to be more interactive with a kodi box it would be great 
Once programmed  this remote is fantastic  Only click once and the tv turns on and goes to the desired channel 
Purchased this to check on our cat while we are away  It was very easy to set up and works as described 
Replaced another hard drive  And really easy to use
So far  the keyboard is fantastic  No problem with key spacing  and it feels fairly natural  No complaint with the keyboard 
These fit in my Sony handycam and work great nice picture and just the right length
This is much better than the old models  Was easy to set up and program  though several trials were needed to get everything fine tuned 
This item worked well for my build  Very happy with purchase 
This memory expansion has really helped my Mac run even faster and smoother  Great product   
this speaker has a nice tone to it  for what i m using it for  Also i like the 4 leds to tell how much charge it has 
This works so much better than the last HotSport we had 
Tossed this in a Mac mini from 2010  Works great  Mac memory is so very expensive   1 to best buy     this is a great value
Upgraded from 8gb and this made computer run so smooth  Worth every penny
Upgraded older jetpack  Use it all the time when travelling 
Used in recording public access videos   no glitches  reliable 
Very easy to hook up and operate  My son can now watch our home cable service in PA from FL  Experienced one issue with inability to log on to service  We called Slingbox and they solved the issue quickly  System works best when you use Firefox as your internet system  Google Chrome created big problems  avoid it 
We use it for a second room  No wires to run  Works great 
Works for all my devices that I own  Easy to setup 
Works great once you program all your devices to the remote just need to be patient with the programming process
Works great  attaches to my Surface Pro 4  the fingerprint sensor works fast and reliably
Works great  Easily connects to my phone  Sound is very clear
Works great  I use it on a daily basis and battery doesn t die fast 
You have to hook it up correctly or u could have problems when u are away and cannot get to itvup fix any problems
I would recommend it to anyone who wants mifi Its portable and easy to use 
I first thought I wouldn t like this device  replaced a harmony one that I had for several years  But once using it for a while  getting use to it  When I bought it  they had a great price on it  so that helped 
Several telephone calls to customer support were required to get this working with my Yamaha AVR  Samsung TV  Motorola STB and Samsung Blu Ray player  Still does not recognize DVD player when using Blu Ray discs 
Could change a few things  I like that it turns on everything 
The remote works with all my smart TV s  I have 3 Samsung TVs in various sizes and models  The oldest model is a 2012 and the newest model is a 2015  On the 2015 model  the ultimate one works but doesn t control all the functions very well  Works great on the earlier models though 
I had a Slingbox solo which in the day worked good but at the last was dropping the signal  So I decided to try the wireless M2  It works great  I watch it on my PC and Roku  It only has one component input  it would be great if they added an hdmi input  other than that its great 
Perfect for most homeowners  Easy to program for most activities and most devices  Programming issues can be resolved with adequate tech support from Harmony 
The hardware was easy to install and you notice a big difference in speed 
Was not 100% sure this would work but was easy to install and setup  Ability to watch cable remotely with good quality  Sometimes have occasional challenge connecting on first try but always ends up working 
Good product for watching your cable anywhere while traveling
The 2 speakers combined work very well and they sound great 
You plug it into motherboard with processor inf it
Works as advertised but the charging cord is loose at the speaker end so it requires wrapping the cord around the speaker to make contact and charge the speaker 
This item was recommended by the salesman and is perfect for our lake dock 
I purchased this since I recently upgraded my internet connection  however  my laptop s wireless card can t be upgraded and is therefore stuck at the old B  G  N standard  Besides the usual driver installation  this was pretty much a plug and play setup  I m seeing true AC connection speeds of over 100 Mbps now with this handy device  Definitely recommend having this connected to a USB 3 0 or newer port 
This thing is great and it works with my surface pro 3 which is outstanding  I use the fingerprint scanner all the time and still haven t had any issues  It s a whole lot easier to type with being as though the keys are spaced out unlike the older keyboard design  It makes the feel of typing very legit and not like your on a tablet yet  it feels like your one a true desktop 
I wish I could get my harmony one or other older models back  this remote does everything you need it to do but it isn t intuitive at all  you have to study a bit to use it properly  The harmony one that died after many years and one to many drops was a much better interface in my opinion  I guess over time I ll get used to it  it does control things very quickly  would recommend with a warning 
The 6620l has a much better battery life than my old hotspot  but it has original software version 1 3  which I cannot upgrade  according to Verizon tech support  That keeps me from 5 stars 
I had a professional set up by Geek Squad of my entire system  including programming the universal remote  and I strongly recommend this  The touch pad is sensitive and took a while for me to get used to it  and the battery seems to need re charging  nice charger stand included  about every third day with medium use 
I like the mouse except that it has no warning when the battery is out of power or near out of power  it just stops working  I leave it plugged in when gaming 
Tapes work fine  Although quality OK in SP mode  EP mode you get 90 minutes instead of 60 but quality suffers a bit  All in all not bad for price 
It works fine but just a little annoyed that I have to buy a new unit for the new Fire TV instead of using my other unit 
Took some  Tweeking  but we have 5 things running off of it  Geek Squad did a fine job installing it 
Works exactly as expected  Definitely a purchase I would make again or refer to a friend 
Ensure you have a pretty solid internet connection before purchasing a Slingbox device  Considering you are most likely streaming content from hundreds of miles away or more  you want to be wired or as close to the wireless access point as possible  both your computer as well as this device you will set up next to the TV  Setup is extremely easy using a phone  Takes less than 10 minutes total Downloading the software for your computer is annoying as it is riddled with ads  every time you log on to watch  at least two ads pasted on page if you are NOT on fullscreen  The page can freeze or crash the script often  This means you ll want to skip commercials or pause the show but will have to wait for a response or refresh the page before being able to do that  It s happened with folks on multiple browsers unfortunately Despite these minor annoyances  this is the best legal way to get your shows  content wherever you want them 
I deiced to try out the fingerprint edition  and I m glad i spent the extra money  it is very convenient and there are lots of good apps that can utilize it 
This remote works on most electronics if it s programmed correctly and used properly
We owned a previous model and absolutely loved it  The prior model had the touchscreen was at the top of the remote and buttons from the middle down  This model has the touchscreen in the middle of the remote and buttons on the top and bottom  This configuration makes it difficult to use comfortably one handed  You need to adjust the remote in your hand depending on which function you need  That is the main complaint with this model 
So I love Logitech products and have multiple smart hubs  I was hoping this is just a  smart remote  with a touch screen Well it is and not  It weighs about 8 of them and really bulkyNot worth kt
I have an old dell tower computer  So I thought with a newer item like this it would take some time to install but I was wrong it�s pretty much plug and play  Seems to work better then my other wireless devices as far as internet speed 
This is a quirky remote  Works better than my last one  but I m still getting used to how it works 
Fingerprint scan literally takes  0001 seconds for Microsoft Hello  Keyboard feels better than a MacBook Pro s  Trackpad words amazing with multi touch 
Works awesome while I m away from home even in Japan
Great ram to start building my new pc
solid product that was competitively prices  would recommend 
I needed good reliable wifi adapter for my desktop pc and this works great 
Just updated from last year model and now works way better and it has Wi Fi
Works as expected  Transmitter is in an odd place on the bottom of remote causing unit to be held almost vertical to send signal to devices 
Wanted to have the ability to stream programs to upstairs bedrooms  Used by guests with no complaints  It works best with a fast internet connection 
I was looking to extend my cable television since my apartment doesn t have an outlet in the bedroom  The Slingbox lets me watch my live tv and TiVo programs on any TV and has the added bonus of letting me watch those things on mobile devices anywhere I am 
purchased as a gift and I ve receiver perfect feedback from recipient
Works as expected     C mon    Why do I need to write a long review
Works just as I d hoped in my new PC build  Would recommend 
Good memory that was available on the shelf  easy install
If you travel a lot you know the security and reliability of hotel wifi  This eliminates that concern 
Works as advertised  have numerous Samsung products that I am satisfied with 
Had to upgrade from original SlingBox due to elimination of support 
I have it controlling 3 tv s  an Apple TV unit  an hdmi switch  and 3 pc s in a large conference room and have not found anything I can t do yet 
MyHarmony app is great to use  and very easy  i like this product so much  that im looking at upgrading to the newest model 
So far these headphones have been working well  Easy set up and connected to multiple devices without issue  one at a time   They stay on when running and exercising  The battery life is suitable  The only issue I have is they are sweat sponges  No odor issues yet but I imagine they will come with time  and no way that I can see of cleaning them  or repairing IF sweat causes damage  It is enough for me  but some may not like the lower volume limit  I like them and think the price was right for the product  purchased as deal of the day  
This one replaced an aged Logitech that was probably 7 or 8 years old  We liked the idea of a charging station instead of a cord hanging out of the wall that the old one used  The display is great  The touch screen is easy to see and works as it should  My only regret is that you still have to point and shoot  Otherwise  it s great  Try to get it on sale  BB has often advertises it on their website as an afternoon GET IT sale 
This device works well    when you push a button on the keyboard the corresponding character magically appears in the refrigerator 
Works but hard to get it to put all systems on have to go back to device settings all the time
I bought the first slingbox ever made available and had to replace it  This one did it  I probably use slingbox everyday and this one covers it  Worth the money if you want to take your tv  via internet  smart device with you wherever there is wifi 
This remote works really well  I m happy with it for sure 
I bought this for the fingerprint ID scanner and I must say I am impressed and I love how it works  If your not worried about the fingerprint ID then this is no different then the other typepads available 
I was able to get one complete 100% charge after being at 2%
I bought refurbished ones first and neither would connect to my computer via USB  Broke down and bought a new one and it works great  I too find that the play  pause  rwd and FF buttons at the very top is strange and makes it difficult to use with one hand sometimes  However it seems well built  feels nice in your hand  and has all the functions you need  We ve only had it a few weeks so I can t comment on durability of this one but it seems great to me  This is my third Harmony remote and I really shopped the competition this time but felt like most did not offer nearly as many features as the Harmony One  or they cost much more  For the money I think this is a great feature set 
Replaced my much older version  Working great so far  Have not had it for very long  but really enjoying using it  Recommend it 
Works as advertised  no frills thrills  just ram  Price was nice too 
Have had no problems with this product  Would recommend 
Installed memory no issues to speak of computer is working flawlessly games blazing
Worked well after I spent half of a day tying to sync it to my existing hub  Turned out the hub needed a firmware update  but two Logitech support people couldn t figure it out 
I was informed that my choice of motherboard could be really finicky when it came to RAM  This worked without issues and even worked well when overclocked slightly 
we mounted a 80  flat screen in our conference room and had recessed in the wall for safety reasons  with this mounting bracket we are able to access the back to hook up various equiptment we would not have attached full time
Although I did upgrade the antenna to the mirror mount antenna that you see on semis the radio receiver worked perfectly  Our first trip out was from Texas to Cotopaxi Colorado and received radio signal through the mountains and the open plains  In the past we have had to switch over to CDs and other media music due to the lack of signal  This is definitely one of the best buy s I ve made in a long time and would recommend it to all

Bought for my Samsung 75  TV  Easy to install  Works great  Allows easy access for cabling or other minor adjustments 
Was pleased with it no problems hooking in from China
Yep they are expensive but very worth the money  Best set of headphones I have bought  Don t know why I waited so long to buy these 
My MAC Mini was extremely slow so I replaced the Memory and now it runs like new again  Great product and very easy to install 
Installed in my Mac  turned it on and the computer recognized it immediately 
This charge worked as advertised to make my brick of a laptop come to life  Only question is why did the OEM one go so soon 
Bought this for an older Macbook  It wirked great 
Disappointed to say the least played with this in the store liked the fact you chain multiple together but no matter what I tried could not reset use another streaming device thought might be my phone used another still nothing returning hesitant to buy another  Bummer
Compatible with canon cameras and captures without problems   All good with audio as well
This product works just like it was supposed to I was able to watch my football game from my phone when I was away from my TV would recommend products to anybody who is looking to have the same situation
Worked as advertised  Mounted a 55 Vizio  and it works great  I can swivel in either direction and its feels solid 
The device replaced a Harmony 1000 which never could control everything  Easy to program  I have not had to pick up any of my other remotes since I got this one  Definitely recommended 
I m not an expert on RAM  but I can tell you that I added the RAM to my motherboard and the computer works fine  And now my computer has more RAM  Not sure what else to say 
Great materials  COMFORTABLE  GOOD Hues  style etc
We needed a Television for or game room and after looking on line at several stores I knew Best Buy would be the best buy for us  After arriving at the store the first Television I saw in the front of the store was a 60 inch samsung for  599 00 I thought it was a mistake   but it was not and I bought it immediately  after best Buy delivered my TV my brother mounted and set up everything and the picture is awesome  we are so happy and satisfied 
Wonderfully effective device for securing internet access in areas of poor reception  I conduct environmental field surveys and take the device with me to the field  Should have done this earlier 
I was very pleased with my new Bowers and Wilkins P7 headphones  The sound quality is outstanding  and the headphones definitely cancel outside noise  The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is the headphones are a bit heavy  making them somewhat uncomfortable to wear for a long time  I perch them towards the back of my head 
Excellent sound more then my expectations it�s really great small price big sound
Excellent sound more then my expectations its really great small price big sound
Great product for people who have difficulties with using multiple tech devices 
This remote is amazing  Works well with all my equipment 
Wonderful product  Although it gets confused easily  I still think it is much better than juggling 4 different remotes 
Our Harmony Ultimate One makes it so much easier for a Sr  Citizen to operate many devices  with little or NO stress   Thank you for such a wonderful product  
Best Buy staff and geek squad were great  Really helpful for someone who is technically challenged
The size of TV works perfect for room we have put it in 
These are a wonderful pair of headphones  The sound is crisp  clear  accurate and bright  These are not abnormally heavy on the Bass  but the bass is represented accurately  They hold a charge for 17 hours  I can charge them three times a week and listen to them for over six hours at work  The noise cancelling features are incredible  it surrounds you in its wall of sound  At the same time  ambient aware on is nice if you want to let a little sound in to talk to your partner or cross the street They have a good  quality build and comfortable ear cups Best Buy recently offered a sale on these  for  250  An incredible buy for the money  I would recommend these again and again  A much better pair of headphones than the more expensive Parrot Ziks that I bought that stopped working in less than two years These are great headphones  and you will enjoy them 
my father in law just moved into his new apartment and his old tv is from the 90 s  when i pulled it out and said  look what santa brought   he was so surprised and so happy  he can see the screen  loves it  
VERY NICE  VERY SHARP PICTURE   GREAT SOUND   I LOVE IT
great sounds  works with Alexa to play music and report weather and etc   
Sony  Beats  Bose  Sennheiser  I have tried them all  These are THE BEST sounding  BEST noise cancelling  BEST phone sounding  BEST bluetooth range  BEST app with equalizer headphones  PERIOD  BUT  I have owned the headphones for just over a year  I use them principally for working out  and the leather over the earcups has started to detach and expose the foam underneath  I have contacted JBL  and I hope they will replace them 
As advertised  with the late 2016 software update  you can connect these speakers wirelessly via Bluetooth to the Sony HTST5 sound bar  only needing cables for power  Or you can connect via smart phone to use as standalone speakers through which to stream music  The sound is exceptional when in 5 1 surround format  needing only minor configuration setting changes to co form to your room for balance and distance  A bit on the pricey side  but I m happy I got these  They sound great 
A great item to have in your to use when entertaining guests as well as during treadmill walks 
getting a wireless and not bluetooth speaker makes a huge difference
I really like the feel of this keyboard  nice to type on and crazy thin When I first got this keyboard windows wasn t great at reading the finger print  if you didn t place the same part of you finger on the pad each time it wouldn t work  Now they take a couple different parts of the finger and it works much better 
If u have an sp3 this is an absolute buy If u have an sp4  u can do without the fingerprint 
Well worth the money spent  My WiFi flies now     
DEVICE WORKED MUCH BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS ONE  SALESMAN WAS VERY HELPFUL 
Traveling we do not have computers with WiFi connection so purchased net gear wireless adapter to accomplish this which it does nicely 
I have one come with my computer is not so good that one is good
Strong Wi Fi connection with no issues with both 2 4 or 5 ghz dual network  It s a little on the bulky side which can cover or hender access to a second usb port but fortunately they include an dock 
Very disappointing  Lists the ability to turn components on  I constantly have to reinstall programing  Family Hates it 
This wi fi working well with my Xfinity cable router which is on seond floor  I have been using it for two weeks now so far so good 
This wi fi device works very well  Internet speed and signal strength are excellent  It is worth the purchase price 
I thought it was a great keyboard  and much better than the pro 3 keyboard   however  the facial recognition software does the same thing as the fingerprint ID  so why even have it? I took this back and bought a cheaper  open box Surface pro 4 keyboard without the ID  I m happy I did  It was not worth the extra money 
I was a little hesitant at first since I read some reviews and most reviewers liked the previous version of the harmony one  Some also don t like the play  pause buttons on the top of the touchscreen  but the ergonomics of this remote is nice enough that its not even a breaking point now that I own it myself to know  Even my brother has the previous harmony one and likes it  I liked the simplicity of this harmony ultimate and the vertical docking station  So far I have programmed it to turn on my Apple Tv  Xbox  Samsung led  Yamaha receiver  and Direct Tv box  The touchscreen favorite channels is so nice  Set up was very easy once plugged to the usb and logged into the Logitech website  I couldn t be more happy with this and am ready to buy a 2nd one for my theater room 
It seems that Home depot has not included all the info you need in order for you to GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR Choice It seems that in order to use this  Home Entertainment  system on a TV you need to have another piece of equipment  An amplifier  My interpretation of ENTRY LEVEL would mean it is a pug and play system not needing any additional equipment That being said  I am greatly disappointed  as is my son  that this in a NOT OUT OF THE BOX READY speaker system  I am returning this and buying one from someone else other than a Home Improvement store  one who deals specifically with electronics SORRY HD you will loose me to a specialty store 
I m shocked that a manufacturer would ever use a magnet that could damage a computer    but Netgear did  I needed a wireless connection for my desktop computer  With limited space on my desk I placed the unit on top of the computer case  Well  I got it setup but it damaged my hard drive making the computer unless to me at that point  I have used other products by Netgear in the past that was why I trusted it would be a good product  Whoever designed this product does not know the dangers of magnets and computers 
Works OK  A replacement to a Harmony One  which was much better  There is a numeric keypad to enter channels but the sensitivity if very bad  so by the time you get the channel in it has changed to the first 1 or 2 numbers  Virtually impossible to get in 3 digits before it changes channels 
I am usually not one to leave a review  but for this remote I feel I have to  The only reason I am giving it one star is because I have to in order to leave a review  This is my 3rd logitech harmony remote  My first 2 were the Harmony 900  which I think is an excellent remote  Unfortunately I have had to replace due to small children breaking the touch screen  The Ultimate one remote is terrible   They have a good idea by trying to make everything a touch screen  However  they have done away with the numbers on the remote  The only way to access them is through the touch screen  Good Luck with That   It will at least take a person SEVERAL attempts to enter the numbers without any hick ups  and I have a great connection   They also have an option where one can assign their favorite channels to a simple touch icon  Good luck with That   That also takes several attempts  I understand the concept but it doesn t work  If you have a chance to buy the Harmony 900  buy it  The only positive I have has nothing to do with the remote  Logitech has upgraded the blaster  so that it connects to your wifi  It is nice to run your TV from your phone  BUT it has its issues as well  I think this would be a great remote IF it had physical numbers to push on the remote  Hope this helps  Sorry Logitech  great concept CRAPPY delivery  
Great bass  easy to pair up  can more then 1 XB30 at the same with the same Bluetooth  Great flasflashing lights Features
I purchased these to cut out noise while I study in professional school  They take a bit of getting used to for all the controls features  but once you master that they have a good amount of charge for daily use 
I registered for this for my wedding and I really regret it  Whoever decided to make the number pad touchscreen should be fired  That s the stupidest  most annoying thing in the world  I programmed it so that when I pressed watch TV it turned on the TV  amp  and cable box  99 of the time it doesn t turn 1 of those 3 on and I have to walk the stupid thing through it  I d sell it if I didn t have a conscience  What remote doesn t have an  input  button on it I don t want to go through a little touchscreen  Awful  awful product 
I have a 2 bay NAS which I use for a backup of pictures  I wanted a drive big enough so I wouldn t have to worry about space for a long time  So far these drive have preformed great 
This cable was the exact same one I needed for my Lenovo flex 15 
This sound horn is very much what I expected I recommended it s gotta be the 1800 w horn
The battery failed completely after only a few months  Logitech customer service is awful  What a waste of 200 
It is doing everything I expected  Easy to set up  easy to use  I have  3  400 disc blu ray players   3  400 disc DVD players  an Onkyo receiver and a 3D player and they all work individually  Since the 400 disc players are of the same manufacture  they are IR programmable  You set each one up on your Harmony one which means having to point the IR to the Harmony learning remote in some cases  You can link your TV  receiver and player to power up and switch to proper HDMI source with the touch of the on screen display that you ve programmed in  Love this remote 
Finally got rid of too many remotes  I recommend having the Geek Squad set it up 
What a picture  My roommate also has a Samsung tv  but his is a couple of years older and doesn t have HDMI  Fast  maker super fast shipping and we ll packaged 
I went back to my old Harmony remote  It works much better than this one  Touch screen not very responsive and too complicated compared to the Harmony One  Love the Harmony One 
I have been using Logitech Harmony products for years and deciding to upgrade to the Ultimate One  It has many more features and works even more seamlessly than its predecessors 
Definite recommend purchase for those looking for a bag to carry their camera equipment  Much more comfortable than using my sling camera bag as it would cause shoulder pain from prolong carrying  I am able to fit my Nikon D7000  2 lens  multi power battery pack and an extra battery hold  external flash  and extra accessories  SD card  lens filter  extra batteries   Even with all this I still have room in the internal pouch  The only con I can think of is when setting the backpack down on a flat surface while having a tripod placed on the bags tripod holder  it will pop out  Not an issue when carrying it though 
There are so many headphones out there that are so expensive  I found these online and looked at the reviews  which were good  Now that I have them  they were right  As far as I am concerned  they are as good as a  300 00 pair of headphones  I bought 2 of them for my wife and I who use them when working out  They are comfortable and work great  Thank you for such a great product at a great price 
WOW  WOW  WOW  We debated on getting this remote  We knew we did not want a voice activated one  and we also knew from experience that we did not want 3   5 remotes to operate our television  bluray  music  wii  and cable  After reading the reviews here and on other websites  we decided to go with the Harmony Ultimate One  Geek Squad programmed it along with our 4K Ultra HD tv installation  This is the best money we have ever spent  It is super easy and we only need one remote for everything   EVERYTHING 
Fast charging  easy to use  holds a charge and charges your phone quickly
Great bluetooth speaker to work with my phone and any device that s compatible  Very loud speaker and holds a charge a VERY long time  Well worth the money for this little thing 
This is my third Samsung television they are very good and customer support is excellent the online diagnosis work perfectly for me
I was looking for a remote that would work on my equipment that is stored in a cabinet  This one fits the bill and does a great job  Love it 
Over the last couple years the number of 2 4Ghz access points visible on my Wi Fi Analytics software has quadrupled      I installed the A7000 on my XEON Workstation and moved the single band WNA3100 to the desktop  The Genie software is easy to use  but is a Pain under WIndows 10   Genie brags in notifications every time the system returns from sleepy sleep and is redundant  I recommend installing the driver ONLY if you understand how    The magnetic base is nice   I have yet to add the dual band router  however the connection is better on 2 4  Wrong adaptor to plug directly INTO your USB 3 0 on a laptop  However  when we travel the internal 2 4 on the my laptop many times may NOT get a decent connection at the hotel  That base positioned for max signal will really help 
This unit is just OK  I installed it into the fairing of my motorcycle  and within the first 200 miles  it started exhibiting strange behavior that worsened  It appears that the connection between the removable face plate and the base unit  It totally died within about 400 miles  Amazon support was ridiculously awesome  however  I called at 10pm on a Saturday night and they had a replacement unit at my door at 4pm on Sunday  So far my experience with the new one has been pretty good  with the exception of one time that the volume just suddenly dropped from 35 to about 4  and another time that I looked at it and the display was back in demo mode  I suspect that I will have to make use of the 3 year replacement warranty that I purchased before it s all said and done  but we ll see 
Well recommended works with google assistant Bluetooth can be paired with Sony�s sound bars to create stereo sound   sounds great
Great tapes Gave me all 60 minutes  also did well with recording over old tape Downloads into computer at excellent quality as well Cannot go wrong with this product 
I have a smart phone but I m still getting used to the touchscreen element for this device  Lots of swiping to get to the correct menu  page up   page down tends to roll up   down on the screen which slows down my surfing 
Product was a gift for my daughter in law who has a new camera and wanted a way to carry her camera and accessories while hiking  etc  She liked the many compartments and that the zipper to access them was toward the back and not exposed to anyone behind her 
Great build quality and cool construction  Performed very well in my new tower  Seamless installation 
Bought this as a wedding present for my brother  Overall great purchase for the sale price 
I would recomnend this produck to any one wanting a alert from weather service 
Radio works great and is very easy to setup alerts 
This is a very well made compact weather radio that also has AM  FM radio reception included  My cat has knocked it on the floor a time or two and not effected the quality of the sound or reception 
This new weather radio replaced the one up at High Cliff State Park in the Handicapped Cabin  It is programmed and works great no more squealing weather radio  Will keep everyone safe who uses the cabin 
We replaced this for our old Logitech controller  They didn t make it anymore  We were disappointed 
We love the great deals that we receive at Best Buy on our Samsung tv�s
We didn t receive screws to attach base to TV  We had to try and find ones to fit  A little concerning 
It s the product which meets our requirements  Nice feature and it s smooth when we adjust the TV  We like it 
We started with Harmony 800   and our recent purchase was the Harmony One  and now we have Harmony Ultimate If you are deciding between the Harmony One or the Ultimate  we recommend you buy the latest one  the Ultimate  Why 1  better grip as the back has a  rough  finish that makes the grip a lot easier 2  has a motion seor as you lift it up  the screen lights immediately  whereas  the One will light up when you touch the screen  3  they added the fast forward and rewind  they added the next  previous chapter button     if you are new to the Harmony family  it pretty much knows most of the devices out there through the website set up  pretty easy to set up  We have multiple devices ranging from Xbox one  play station  TiVo and Bose    that is why we remain a Harmony fan   family as it is one of the universal and easy all in one remote  highly recommend the new one  we love it 
I have hd WD drives in the past with no problems  unfortunately this one was dead on arrival 
Western Digital has been and always will be my choice
This remote is great  I really like how you can program your 50 favorite channels for quick changes  It is really great how it syncs up with my DVR and I can do everything I need to do to watch my programs  The way you can swipe and get the different screens is really cool and useful  I really like how if something isn t working right you can just use the HELP button and it will trouble shoot the problem for you  The only thing that could be better is the battery life  It seems like it just dies sooner then it should and when it dies you can t do anything but it charges pretty fast so it isn t so bad 
these speakers sound great and the subwoofer gives a theater like feel with the bass this speaker system is perfect for me
Great sound  Won t stand next to beats or Bose  but it s water resistant  and can pair with other Sony speakers at the same time    Caught a Father s Day sale  Solid purchase 
Sling box allows you to access your home TV from anywhere  Being away from home during the World Series and college football season can be rough  Never miss a game again with sling box 
The Slingbox M2 allows you to watch you own cable TV when you are away from home  It is fairly easy to setup by following the instructions  Access with your computer  tablet or cell phone wherever you have internet connection  Not the same quality as HD at home  but a decent picture to watch your favorite TV shows or sports 
The logitech remote s touch screen is problematic and is difficult to handle   You need to hold the top with one hand  while you push the buttons on the bottom of the remote but must be careful not to touch the screen whilst doing so     and there are endless options  I have reached an age where I am not looking for a thousand uses for my universal remote I look for ease and simplification  We have not used our surround sound in ages because it is not set up in an intuitive way  You need to plow through the manual to figure out how to listen to the sound for the TV    but it was the only universal available at Best Buy that day and they seemed to be pushing it   
garbage remote bought it and returned an hour later not worth a penny of the  250 do not waste your money harmony 650 or 700 does the same for a fraction of the price 
I bought this product with the understanding that it did more than my phone already did  well it does not it  First off the apps that are available are very limited  Pandora being the main one  There is iHeart radio  and a couple others but  most of us use pandora  Second a big screen and you can not watch any media content  there is a park brake switch  and safety features  so why not? This radio serves no other purpose than acting as a phone and half the time you can t hear the person or they can t hear you if you have the AC  heat on or any window down  You can t talk to text or ask Siri anything for the same reason  I would rather have my factory system  and my 800 I spent on everything  This head unit   display panel offers nothing but a credit card payment or a lighter wallet  Save your money do something fun  like a weekend at the beach 
Reception in my location wasn t as good as I had hoped 
The type cover for the surface pro 4 was recommended to me and is great  The space between the keys is a HUGE improvement  The fingerprint reader is a great shortcut to getting into the instrument
Maybe my expectations were too high  It charged my cell phone overnight  but when I wanted to put a charge on my phone at the airport  and use the phone at the same time  I was hoping for a little better results  I wish there was a better way to tell the level of charge remaining in the battery pack 
Great purchase  saved me money to go wireless  Very easy to set up  I am not a computer nerd 
It really helped to have internet service on the road instead of using public WiFi 
I had a Hormony ONE for several years before it needed to be put out to pasture  Seeing how much I loved that remote  I thought I would love this one as well  Well I do  mostly  Setup is cake  Customization is a breeze  the remote is the perfect size  So what s the issue The touchscreen is WAY too sensitive  When palming the back of the remote  the touchscreen will sense my thumb near  not on  the touchscreen and will randomly change the channel  This is extremely frustrating and a fatal flaw in my book
To start off sound is super objective to the individual listening so I m not saying I m a sound aficionado just going to tell you how it sounds to me  First thing that you need to talk about with this unit is the unboxing experience  The manufacturer made it a fun experience with a quality feeling EVERYTHING  Once you get past that you see all its features and I was excited  I booted mine while it was on it s wireless charger to find my first pro and con  Alexa is great if you have amazon music which to be fair Logitech gives you a trail of it to get you started  I don t listen to my music from Amazon and didn t like that I was forced into because my music service was not supported  Asking basic things like paus stop or next track are fun but I noticed that when I used the Alexa side it disconnected the Bluetooth side    every    single    time  So I stopped using it for that and just focused on sound quality  Unfortunately this was a tall order on this unit  I felt the sound had a incredible amount of treble which hurt me even at 50% volume  My phone luckily supports a great equalizer built in and I tweaked it to sound good but not great  For how much you invest in a unit like this I felt like they fell short  It has a lot of things to love like the basic waterproofing it offers and wireless charging to make everything super simple but to me those are cool  gimmicky  To summarize if water proof speaker is what your looking for with wireless charging then I would say this is probably the best one  If your looking for the best sound you can get I would say maybe something else Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helped a little in your decision  Good Luck 
Good combo speaker with Alexa  will be better once it�s updated to use other music services  Looses connectivity every once in awhile but not a show stopper 
I came in to Best Buy to buy the Sony XB40 Bluetooth speaker but they were sold out  I was going to the lake for the weekend and wanted music in camp so I let the sales associate talk me into settling for the downsized XB30  I should have waited  The sound is not nearly as rich  and the bass is sub standard  Whats worse  when I pushed the  Mega Bass  button in an effort to bump it up  I was rewarded with an annoying buzzing each time the bass hit  I subsequently returned the XB30 to Best Buy and upgraded to the XB40  which I have been very pleased with 
I use this everyday for my dog and he loves it also
Always use this in my video camera  It takes great video and pictures  I will use nothing but this product  I have taken it on many very important vacations and I have never been let down or missed anything on my vacation 
Purchased for my 13 year old daughter  She didn t have any problem getting the Bluetooth to pair with her iPhone without my help  She uses it a lot and I haven t heard any complaints about the battery going dead in the middle of use  I assume she uses it for phone conversations too  and hasn t told be of any problems Probably not the headphones of choice for an audiophile  but for a kid who tends to lose or break her electronics  this is a good value for the money    and the sound is plenty good enough for what she listens to 
I use this at my vacation house  to avoid the need for an additional cable  satellite account  It works great for that  but the tablet software is a little buggy  but not bad  Works best with plenty of bandwidth  otherwise  there is some lag and buffering  I purchased to use with my Chromecast  and a few times  the Slingplayer software can t find the chromecast  even though the TV says they are connected  Install is very simple  great support I recommend this  it does the job   but not perfect 
Wireless Bluetooth Noise cancelling headsets? Yeah  It was my unicorn  I was so excited when I first saw these  Search the net for reviews    not many  It s a Best Buy exclusive  so no other sites carry it Read the reviews here    Most are very positive  Few negative ones  All in all  not enough to dissuade me So I bought them Let the disappointment begin First  the Packaging is horrible  it s almost impossible to open the box and take everything out without at least tearing some of the paper off with all the tape  Not a huge deal    but for high cost items  I like to try to keep in intact Next packaging problem  How to take the headphones out  Turns out there are 2 small clear plastic pieces of adhesive right over the metal on the band  Couldn t tell it was plastic to be removed until I had to force the first one out Ok  Frustrating but  not a big deal The  quick start  documentation is pretty horrible  They show you the buttons  but they don t describe what they are for   Maybe I m not aware of the ISO symbol for LED or for the  Smart  button Finally turn them on  and they went into paring mode  white  red LED flashing   Search on my phone  Nothing  turn them off  turn them back on   same thing  Manual doesn t describe what the various flashing lights mean  both LEDs flash white? Red LED flashes twice?  Finally I resorted to their website  Found a FAQ on how to pair with a new device  Power button for 16 seconds   YAY  IT finally pairs I anxiously fire up my Google Play Music app to hear music  The first 5 seconds it crackles  pops  and drops out and back in  After that  they sound pretty good   Maybe it was just that start up  Hit the next track button  Same thing  First 5 seconds are horrible  then it settles down OK   Maybe it s the app  You Tube  Same problem  if not worse  So  now getting annoyed   300 headphones and all these challenges? Maybe it s other cell  wifi traffic that s interfering  So  go into airplane mode  and turn on ONLY blue tooth  Crackle crackle drop crackle So  last ditch effort  I decided to see just how good the ANC  Ambient noise was  So    No music  Just changed settings for the ANC  The room was already reasonably quiet  but I put on the TV with talking just to see how well it filtered it out  just like a chatty plane passenger might be   Switching between the 3 levels  and turning them off  I could hear a difference in the tone quality  but between off  and max  I couldn t tell as much difference between them  Not like my Bose headphones were NOTICEABLY muted the first time I turned those on  wired  not Bluetooth  Lastly  when reaching for the  smart  button  I bumped the micrphone right near that button  It was a very pronounced mic pickup  If I was wearing a coat with a hood or something  it would constantly interfere  I ve paired my Nexus 6P phone to multiple speakers and headphones  and never had any of these issues  Tomorrow  these go back  I would spend HOURS on the phone with support trying to address all these issues  And I m not going to sit here and hope for a firmware update All in all  I was very disappointed in these headphones  A friends Beats headphons  no ANC  just BT  over the ear  were much better from a refinement perspective  Hopefully over time  JBL  Harmon will improve both their documentation and their software  and their headphones  But for now  it is very much a  first version  type of headphones    not something that is worth  300   
These remotes came a long way  Still pricey for a remote 
Because the price was great  on e day sale online  I felt there was little to lose considering the higher price of so many other earphones with or without blue tooth  They look fine in color blue and the sound is so much better than the wired headsets that can be annoying at the gym  I would recommend this unit  I also researched reviews before I placed the order 
This is a preliminary review after a week or so of use  I have now retired five remotes including my previous Logitech Harmony 510  The remote has a nice feel and is easy to operate  Occasionally  it skips  By that I mean  when I choose one thing  I get another  but infrequently and it is not a major problem It takes a while to find something but I am sure this will improve with use  The learning curve is probably more steep than with the 510 and I m still searching for things however  the menu layout is reasonably logical so that is a help  One thing I miss from my 510 is the ability to skip forward 30 seconds or backwards 10 seconds when watching a recording  That is an extremely useful tool that should be incorporated in the next model   or did I miss itAnother thing I really wish could be incorporated into remotes  including this one  is the feature on the Roku remote  a headset plugin capability  This is extremely useful since it eliminates long cords  Perhaps future models Overall  I am quite  not yet very  happy with the HUO remote and expect to continue using it for a number of years 
I like the one touch buttons to turn on and turn off my entertainment systems  A lot of useful features and it recognized all the devices 
Works great indoor  outdoor  Good range and acceptable sound quality 
I bought this keyboard for the finger print reader and it does not work consistently  About one in ten logins will it actually work  sometimes the option to use the fingerprint reader isn t even available     not happy   
Recomended by Geek Squad  Does the job  The screen and buttons are very sensitive  so you have to be careful when you handle it
Overall the unit is high quality  Drawback is the recessed tv view  Appears crooked when flat against wall 
I have three of these brackets  Two of these each hold a 65 inch curved Samsung and another holds a 78 curved Samsung  They are strong and durable  The 78 inch is 100 pounds and these are rated to hold 125 pounds  Installation is easy and takes about thirty minutes  Depending on where the studs are located in the wall  you may not be able to center it  as it requires to mount onto two studs  Fortunately the brackets flexibility allow you to pull  tilt and move in different ways to help you center the tv  I have had mine four 4 months and really like them  I highly recommend 
Easy to follow instructions  very sturdy  not a huge turning range but enough for a big TV  We a pleased with the product 
Very smooth keyboard   must buy for all the surface users 
I like the LCD on this remote  My only complaint is that this remote is too slow  When I press  Watch TV  it starts up and is unusable for about 25 30 seconds while starting up  This is an issue if the kids were watching tv at a loud volume level  Then  after they are in bed and I try to watch tv  the volume is very loud and I am not able to adjust it down until the remote is ready  30 seconds of loud TV once the kids are in bed is like 10 minutes  underwater The battery life is only 3 days or so  compared to my last harmony remote that lasted 10 14 days I m thinking about going back to my old 700 series Harmony 
Great product and very slim  The only bummer is that my very slim 60 Sony TV bulges out slightly at the bottom at the back which means I had to add  included  1 spacers to the back of my TV  So it s a bit annoying paying for a super slim wall mount but then have to double the distance from the wall with a couple of pieces of plastic  Fortunately because the wall mount it so slim  the TV is still very close to the wall and still looks great  It s very easy to pull the TV out and move it around too so all in all  I m very happy with the purchase 
I think this has to be one of my very best purchases of late  Hooked the device up according to the directions and was able to watch television through my cable box using every device I own  everywhere  And if you re really tech savvy you can even gain access to the video stream itself and watch it in situations not officially supported  such as using a Linux OS Quality scales very well  with several bit rates and resolutions available  Box automatically de interlaces for all typical resolutions  except 1080 as far as I can tell  1080 stream appears to be interlaced so deinterlacing must be performed client side  The official Windows Slingplayer client does a decent enough job of this  but VLC has much better deinterlacing capabilities if you have the horsepower Very happy with this purchase  And if you re a geek about managing video streams at home  you re gonna love this 
I needed more memory on my desktop and laptop Apple computers  I was able to install this memory kit within 5 minutes  I purchased this brand because they had the best reviews  So far I am very happy with my purchase 
Controls are overly sensitive and small  Prefer Sony remote supplied with the TV 
I wasn t really sure about this product  mostly because of the Bluetooth mic and how good it would be or not be  but I m extremely impressed with it  I like how you can adjust the sensitivity of the mic  In my opinion  this was worth the money 
This is a very responsive and comfortable mouse for gaming or any other tasks that may have you holding on to your mouse for hours on end  Battery life is good and the mouse can be used while charging 
Very easy to work with  recharges quickly  very reliable
do not need to have 4 remotes on the tv stand lots of options and instructions available
I use this computer to do graphic design and some video work  The machine is very powerful handles everything I throw at it  I run a dual monitor setup and love this pc 
Works as advertised good instruction with on line assistance available
I expected a lot more being that Alpine is a very good known brand  I m very disappointed because the installation was not a simple process and the outcome was very disappointing  My stock speakers sound a lot better 
Alpine is not as good as they used to be  Definitely needs to step up their game
Hello all Please do not waste your money  The product is not great   not much innovative  It is a normal remote   good thing is it has screen  Other than that the product is not user friendly  You should have logitech hub and which costs additonal        I am gonna return the product    
I bought this primarily to gain the Fingerprint ID capability for my Surface Pro 3  Not only does the Fingerprint ID work very well  but the new arrangement  spacing of the typing keys is an unexpectedly dramatic improvement 
I really enjoy using this mouse  hardly no lag at all
I received the order in a timely fashion and have been very happy with the use of the video tapes 
Bought this to hang my Samsung 55  tv  very easy to mount and looks great 
Liked the computer  Works faster than expected  Nice feel to it 
This is the second one I have  Does great  Easy to program 
Plug and play  very nice 
I love that these are light   easy to use  You can also easily go from listening to music to replacing   receiving phone calls 
We needed a small TV for one of the walls so we decided to get SMART and without breaking the bank  Can�t go wrong with this Samsung model 
Has a nice clear picture and very good color  Easy to operate and set up 
I love this stereo has great sound  bass could be deeper  Nice  
Love the speaker is loud for it s size charges my phone and is easy to carry
Like the sound of these  I would recommend them  working great
Performs as expected     the vast majority of the time  Sometimes it seems to lose its programing as to a particular function  I don t know if I accidentally hit a wrong button first that threw it off or it just failed  Luckily  each time it failed  I have gone in the drop down menu and selected Fix It which presents a menu of devices  You then select the device that failed and you are provided with various possibilities as to the failure  Let s say you hit the off button and your receiver failed to shut off  You just select your receiver which is automatically listed under Fix It and then select the Power Off button  Each time the receiver shut off and was thereafter fixed until the next mishap which is acceptabely rare  Another consumer caused problem can be that when you hit off you did not aim your remote in the direction of the receiver long enough  So my Ultra High Def Vizio will shut off but my Onkyo receiver may remain on  The macro involved with all combined functions sends separate signals out to each device that had been needed for the function button that was previously used  e g  Watch TV  Watch Smart Devices  Watch Blue Ray  Listen to FM  In any case  it allows me to keep all my other remotes in a convenient location  in case there is a failure that might require one of them  but the Harmony is the sole remote on my bed  Nice 
If you are familiar with the harmony web based setup  then setup is a breeze  I also have a Harmony Touch  so the setup was painless for me  I recall the Touch took about 20 min the first time  and subsequent trips to the setup for new devices or channel favorites was a snap The screen interface difference with this unit  to me  is cleaner now  It is less cluttered than my Touch Since I had the Touch setup  when I logged in to My Harmony  it asked me if I wanted to transfer the settings to the Ultimate One   well yes I do  thank you very much  Boom  just like that all my devices were set up  However  we just got an AppleTV  and as one might guess  it was a breeze to set that up too For those that don t know  you enter your devices on the website  then create activites based on them  For example you have a tuner  a TV  a cable box  a game console  a Bluray player  and an AppleTV  for Watch TV   you use the TV  the tuner  and the cable box  You let the Harmony know the HDMI  or other input  on the TV  that the tuner gets switched to cable  sat  Then the activity becomes  turn on the TV and make sure it is switched to the proper input  turn on the tuner and switch it to the proper output  and turn on the cable box  When you hit the off button all get turned off  Say while watching tv you want to watch a movie  Then the cable box gets turned off  the Bluray player gets turned on and the tuner switches its output mode to Blu ray  DVD  Same for gaming  radio  etc After the unit is programmed your remote situation goes to a single remote and touch screen goodness My woman loves them  One remote  so no clutter  She wants to watch TV  she touches watch tv  then goes to our favorites to tap an icon of the channel s logo  It is quick an painless to bring up the soft number pad for change the channel manually Most major functions of all devices are on the remote  I still need to get the device remotes out for things like firmware updates  or specialized functions  or to run specific apps like netflix  But for the day to day   one remote does it all and that is fantastic 
Overall the remote is great  Just wish the battery life was a little better  We mainly use it in the evening for a few hours and after 2 days it is dead 
I would definitely recommend this to others  The sound is very nice 
The spacing of the keys is improved over earlier versions
These are a great pair of head phones because of the sound and they fit very comfortable on my head 
This controller is very smart  I like the app and the online configuration 
Computer will restart at random times  Explorer Edge won t reload at times and just stays blank  Will show connected to network but no internet connection and nothing will load  Must cut off and restart to get it to work again and then always gives an error code when shutting down for a restart or during the restart  Time to take it back and try something else I suppose 
I brought this Bluetooth speaker for my son s birthday gift  He loved it 
I was looking for nice over the ear wireless headphones  I read tons of reviews and everything was leading me to the Bose QC35  After listening to them in the store  I was impressed with the richness of the sound  but didn t really want noise cancelling  I ve got a pair of Bose in ear for that purpose and those are simply the best at blocking out unwanted sound   much better than the QC models IMHO   They didn t block out a lot of noise in the store and the noise cancelling seemed a bit overbearing  I started trying different models in the store and literally stumbled upon the JBLs  It didn t take long for me to be totally impressed with the sound quality and full richness of the sound  I was going to the the non ANC model  but they were out of stock  This one was close in price so I splurged a bit  I m glad I did  ANC   it s really not that useful  I does block out some ambient sound while music is playing and gives a bit more focus to the music really  Does it drown out voices or other louder noises? No  This is very minimal effect  The nice thing is that the music sounds precisely the same with it on or off  The ANC can easily be switched off while preserving the sound quality  If anything I d say the ANC might clean up the music a bit  but it s not so processed that it changes the sound  For louder volumes  you d be hard pressed to tell if it s on or off  If you re looking for serious noise cancellation  this is not the one to get  The packaging is very nice and top notch  As a surprise  there is a carrying case included  Just a pouch and not hard sided  but a nice pouch that is not at all cheap looking or feeling  Kudos for that  The sound   it s great  Really great  Full and rich and not at all processed sounding  It s really nice  Deep bass  clear highs  Really can t tell that this is not plugged in as the sound is superb  Even at full volume  there is never any punch to the base  just a nice low rumble  The highs never screech  but get delivered with nice clarity  The mids and voices are clear and right where they should be  JBL did this right  The app on the phone has preset equalizer settings  or you can create your own custom profile  more than one   The bluetooth has great range and doesn t skip a beat  The battery percentage shows up near the bluetooth icon on my iPhone  It paired quickly and without any issues  I just got these a few hours ago so can t really comment on the battery life just yet  Plugged in with the included cable  the sound is exactly the same so far as I can tell  That is   as long as they are switched  on   When switched off  they will work  but there is a drop in quality  When a cable is plugged in  bluetooth is shut off immediately  When the cable gets unplugged  bluetooth switches back on right away and it re connects with the phone  The size  weight is a lot  These are not small and can be a bit heavy resting on the top of your head  The padding is there but could be more to alleviate some pressure  Could just be me as I ve not had over the ear headphones in a long time  but worth mentioning here  Another really nice thing is that with the app  I could update the firmware over bluetooth  I think previous models were windows pc only  but this updated easily and without a problem  Some have said that the lag when watching videos is terrible  Must have been a firmware thing because there is positively no lag at all  After just a short amount of time I m quite impressed and happy with my purchase  Not so sure about the white color  but for some strange reason is a lot less in price over the black ones so I saved the money  At BestBuy they have a display where you can plug in your phone and listen to your own music or a pre set playlist on the display  I HIGHLY recommend doing that and comparing the same songs or videos with multiple models  Forget these reviews as sound is highly subjective  Just don t pass these up as they really are a very nice yet may be overlooked for Beast or Bose 
Nice little Bluetooth speaker with great sound Easy set up
I love that the keys light up for me  I also love that they only light up when in use  which saves battery power and reduces light pollution  I specifically got the fingerprint scanner  however the facial recognition on my surface makes it less important  I did still set it up  I have not used it once  though it may be nice for when using my computer in a dark room  My only frustration is that I cannot adjust the tilt of the screen without using the kick stand  You never realize you may want to do that until you don t have it lol  It has been easy to change positions form my normal ones to accommodate the difference though  so I would not let that deter me 
this product has a good sound but I wish the wires were longer
Commenting on this great sounding Bluetooth speaker  Got this to use outside  and does a great job  Connects to my iPhone easily and plays flawlessly for a long time  I can go several days of using off and on without recharging  On a separate note  the app for the phone is not the greatest  Have to dig several layers to try and find a battery level  and even then its not super precise  But since I don t go into the app very often  it isn t a big deal to me 
Good build  works as one would expect  I am a gamer and have been satisfied with it  Bought on sale and always been fan of logitech products 
The finger print scanner eliminates the need to enter a password to get in and makes logging I to the surface pro a snap 
Works Great and has a lot of features  Only downside is that it is not BLUTOOTH    
Unless there is something I am completely missing   I wanted to purchase a wireless stereo for my home  I read and read all the reviews anywhere and everywhere I could find them  People we very impressed with this system  My fianc drove 90 minutes out of town to the closest Best Buy and made the not so cheap purchase  She brought the exact same unit I picked out  Un packed it only to discover the Unit is not WIRELESS   Here is the exact description for the product  Sony   1800W Wireless Bookshelf Stereo System   Black    Never even hooked it up and Sony is missing out on a sale because of their VERY MISLEADING DESCRIPTION

This is a great speaker very loud and durable  Also great that it has Alexa 
Excellent choice to get a very reliable WiFi connection  easy to install 
A little more difficult to set up than I hoped for but now that it s working  it s fantastic 
Makes life much easier without having to deal with 10 remotes laying around
First time writing a review  about anything  I had all of my components set up with the Ultimate One and Hub  cable box  DVD player  Fire TV  and ZVOX Soundbase  in the space of 20 minutes  Very happy 
Received this as a present so I didn t pick it out  Very happy with the quality of the sound
Wish hdmi was an option but was able to watch away from home  which is great 
Good for the money  but it is best to have a larger data plan when using it 
I didn t have high expectations for this  but was pleasantly pleased  We had a low audio issue with a couple of the streaming services we subscribe to and even though we had a  soundbar  hooked up  it still wasn t loud enough to hear comfortably if ANYTHING else was running nearby  so I had a gift card laying around and looked around for a solution near the price range of the gift card and this was what I decided to try  and I have to say I m glad I did  Day and night difference  we can use all of the streaming services and actually hear them  even if there is a fan or two nearby running  it was easy to hook up and we ve tried all the inputs available and they all have worked beautifully  so  we are very happy with it 
Still learning it but so far it seems great for watching football when I m away  Wish there was an easier way to sling to another tv though 
I am more confident in my internet security using this device  I don t always trust the WIFI connections I find at most public places 
So happy I purchased this jetpack  We are always searching for wireless signals  they are hard to find especially when you are on vacation
used this while on a trip last weekend  was great to charge up the phone while out and about with out access to electricity  Goof for one whole charge and more    even charges at a decent rate  thought I m sure there is better out there
This is my third harmony remote  Setup was very easy  I was above to migrate all of my old settings from the previous remote to the Harmony Ultimate One  Multiple remotes are now supported under your harmony account so macros can be shared between remotes  Setup would be better if it were not dumbed down forcing you to answer questions  I would rather have the option to write macros The learning curve for using the remote was very minimal  The touch screen is both nice and a hindrance  The touch screen is very customizable  but items cannot be selected on the screen without looking at it  Battery life has been excellent In my opinion this Logitech remote is still one of the best universal remotes available despite its shortcomings 
This Harmony One was simple to set up and is operating 5 components There are a few sub functions that aren t as easy  simple to set up  but so far I ve been able to hack my way through  for the most part 
This is my second Harmony remote model so all I had to do was to log in to my Harmony account and download the settings  It remembered all my devices  Sweet  My favorite feature on the Ultimate One is the screen swipe mode which acts like a mouse pad for quick navigation 
Great TV  good clear picture  easy to set up  attractive when not in use  good sound  All in all a great value
Very good quality tapes  I use them to film skateboarding and various projects like weddings  etc and defiantly a good buy and deal locally for dv camcorders
I have an old DTV camra  this old tech but still works good  But only with good tape that runs smooth  This tape has given my many hours of use without any problems
Got this for my boyfriend  He loves it  Easy to set up  A bit large  but sound is loud and clear  Light are great  Highly recommended 
I had a hi 8 sony and loved her till she died    10 yrs of me Sony rules
The Speakers work great  loud and sound good  Extremely easy to set up  Sound is does fill the backyard  Placed on two corners of the back yard  Was able to direct the sound 
   with the only downside being the amount of volume that the speaker produces  However  because of the price of the higher end speakers  this one works fine for what I need it for 
I liked that this surround system was in my price range  It is a great set for the cost and does the job well  I don t need anything too crazy so I didn t feel the need to spend tons of money  They were easy to install and came with everything necessary to hook them up  I have them hooked up to a Yamaha receiver so I am unsure how they work with a different brand  but they seem to work well so far with my set up 
This speaker is very good  It has excellent build quality  the buttons are very tactile and the sound quality is amazing  The bass is the main feature  It can also get very loud and is a charging bank if needed  Battery life is very good as well  Highly recommended for anyone looking for a speaker that s loud  has punchy bass  water resistant and looks very good 
Great sound and easy to use  I felt this unit had better sound quality than a similar unit from Bose for a lot less money 
Very good quality product  Perfect size  color and light effects as music plays is great 
This bluetooth portable speaker has very good sound quality and the battery life is outstanding it also works good as a handsfree for my phone 
Very impressed with the sound quality and wireless functionality  
Very good sound for the Price  I had to have this shipped to my house  Not in the local BB store
I purchased this to listen to podcasts and  or music while exercising or at night  Doesn t disturbing anyone not wanting to listen to what I m hearing  Comfortable  Haven t found any negatives yet  Very good value compared to prices I ve seen for similar products 
This speaker is great  the sound of awesome and it s easy to use Alexa  It keeps a charge for quite a while
Easy set up works great  Saw the same thing at Sam s Club for more than 50 00 less  Check their first 
Very good remote  controls all my devices   Samsung TV  Benq projector  Marantz AV amp  Sky HD  and PS3  with an infra red dongle   if you don t have one of these  this model can t control it  and same for PS4  apparently as it requires Bluetooth   even a couple of obscure old gadgets are still supported  Even if the device is not in the database  you can still learn commands from the original remote as a last resort I like the harmony remotes because of the Activity concept  One button can  for example  turn on the TV  receiver and Blu Ray player and set all the inputs to the correct setting ready to watch  while turning off unused devices  The more gadgets you have  the more benefit you get from a device like this This was an upgrade  replacement for an old model Harmony 525  and while I like this well enough  it is more complicated in use than the old model General build quality is very good  much better than the older model  it feels sold and weighty in the hand  The rounded back makes it easy and comfortable to hold  but it wobbles around on the coffe table  The remote slides easily into the charging dock  and as the 525 used to chew through batteries  this is much better  However  the battery in the remote is not easily replaceable  so I hope it has reasonable longevity The feel of the backlit hard buttons is very good  with a nice positive click  much better than the old dead flesh rubber buttons on the 525 The D pad and navigation buttons are well placed and easy to use  but the main play  pause  FF  RW controls are a bit awkwardly placed  but still useable The touch screen display provide customisable soft buttons and obviously conveys much more information than the tiny monochrome LCD on the old model  but as it is a capacitive type  like a smartphone  it is very sensitive and easy to hit the wrong soft key  The remote beeps and vibrates when a touch screen button is used  but it s not as positive as a real button and you have to look at the remote   you can t navigate by feel Fortunately the touch screen is used mostly for secondary functions  and the hard keys cover the typical primary controls  Number keys are only touch screen buttons and therefore more difficult to use than real buttons  but favourite Sky channels can be shown as a colourful page of icons  which is easier than remembering the channel number  However  to be honest  if you are like me you use the Sky Guide page anyway  which only needs the direction pad to navigate  To be fair after a few weeks  I really have put away all the original remotes as I don t need them  so this device does the job The programming software is pretty easy to use  a bit quirky in some ways  but since I was used to the old version  I found it easy enough  and the new version is an improvement  Also  unlike the old 525 model  a certain amount of customisation can be done directly on the remote without using a PC at all  You can do a basic set up in a few minutes  but you will probably need a couple of hours to set it up perfectly of you have several devices to control 
This is a really good remote  Would be perfect if the touch screen was at the top instead of in the middle of the remote 
This remote is easy to use  It is smaller than my old one with way more capabilities  Love the display screen 
I ve also recorded on Sony s Top of the line Digital HD Video  Both are Very Good 
These are very good quality tapes at a very reasonable price 
Very good product  Extremely pleased so far with all the features  One thing I would recommend is to make the red and yellow power wires on the wiring harness as long as the black ground as I had to add extensions onto them to reach the wires I was connecting them to 
Lots of wattage  crystal clear highs  deep booming lows  Overall this product is well worth having 
Nice item for the price  easy set up  makes things much easier to control
Bought this for our master bedroom  Very happy with this TV purchase  Easy set up  great picture quality  Have had no issues  would recommend it 
I m constantly traveling  so wireless headphones were a necessity to me The noise cancellation on these is very  very good  especially on the plane  
This is an excellent headset for use with my iPad Mini  It connects  Blue Tooth  easily and sounds great  Friends report that the nearly invisible mic sounds as clear as when I am using a boom  It performs on a par with much more expensive headsets My only issue is with the  feel  of the headset  The set is of constrained design due to being foldable  When wearing them  they feel a bit awkward to me because of the way they need to be arranged on my head  When I put them on  I find myself a bit distracted as they feel awkward  However  this passes quickly and I have worn them for communications that have lasted up to two hours without issue 
The speaker works decently as long as you do not pair it over time to different sources 
Configuration of the remote was little tedious and the instructions provided were not good  Once setup it was fantastic to use 
I think the fingerprint reader is probably not necessary for the Surface as facial recognition with the IR camera seems much quicker  The keyboard is responsive and compliments the Surface build and design perfectly  The touchpad is okay and that s why it loses a star for me  Make the touchpad a little more clickable 
Very good item
I loved the stereo and the ability to have access to all my music and contacts from my iPhone  I used it for a few days using the SiriusXM app on my phone but in the end  I had to return it for a unit that included SiriusXM built in Also note that there is no Bluetooth on this unit so you can t stream media from your phone of make phone calls if your phone is not plugged in It s a good unit if the limitations I mentioned do not bother you 
Even though this is a very basic hotspot  it fits my needs and price point  Easy to use and learn 
i used them when i mowe the lawn great for keeplng the nose out music in
My son loves the speaker  he takes everywhere and stays connected to it  I loved it so much that I bought two more of the smaller ones 
We already owned a first version and we were very happy and to see a higher picture quality we update to M2 it s a new world
Very good computer  It replaced an old one  It is smaller than the old one with more memory
There is only one reason why I cant give 5 stars  Its the lack of a spanish keyboard
Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control  915 000224 Logitech finally came up with a replacement for the supremely popular Harmony One remote  It is called the Ultimate One and it is essentially the Ultimate without the RF kit  It is exactly that because in the software there is an upgrade offer to sell you the RF puck and cables to transform this to the Ultimate  It adds the missing features like controlling devices in a cabinet and setting up smart devices  like an iPhone  to act as remotes  Its a good way to start out slow and add features if you need them  The upgrade is one hundred dollars  the same difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate One so its a reasonable way to expand it The hand feel of the remote is good  It isnt too heavy and its smaller than the remotes that preceded it  The touch screen is larger than earlier models and there are fewer hard keys than before too  I do miss some easy to use keys over the touch screen but Im getting used to the overall use  The screen visual quality is good but because of the layout Favorite icons are smaller than before and they suffer in terms of resolution  Overall the screen is easy to see and the hard buttons are all backlit for easy seeing in the dark  The lights all go dim by a user settable timer  The afore mentioned icons can be used to set up 50 favorite channels for ONE provider  This is the biggest shortcoming for the current line up of Harmony remotes  Previously you were able to set up multiple carriers  such as Time Warner Cable and Over The Air and have sets of icons for each one  That ended with the new software and new remotes  Tech support says they are considering a change but as of this writing  its as it is  There have been numerous updates and feature enhancements for the Ultimate remote and the U1 takes advantage of them  Among the updates was the addition of a sleep timer in the remote so you can shut off the activity you are watching while falling asleep  They also added the ability to add custom backgrounds  in addition to the included set  A good source for custom icons and soon  backgrounds is iconharmony dot com  Using these custom graphics really helps to personalize your remote My one main nit to pick with the hardware is the choice to seal in the battery  On previous remotes Logitech had issues with the battery pack expanding and they wound up replacing many remotes  I dont think the solution to use a custom sealed in battery is a good choice  When the battery dies you will have to mail in the remote to them or a service center  Not a great solution in my opinion You program the remote with a website app at myharmony dot com  On the forum they recently announced a new software offline solution is being rolled out  This was how it used to be and many are happy it is coming back  This is a very good but not perfect and certainly not an Ultimate remote  I do like it and have grown used to it  including using its brother The Ultimate  and I do like it  If I was designing it Id have used a much higher resolution screen and used standard rechargeable  replaceable batteries  So Im deducting one star but still recommend it for its usability with the vast amount of systems 
I am very happy with my purchase of the Sony LBT GPX555 audio system  It has completely changed the way I listen to music  Before my purchase of this audio system I was listening to music on my desk top computer through a pair of Bose speakers  I was not satisfied with the sound from this set up  I pair the Sony with my phone LG Stylo2  and use aps like Napster formerly Rhapsody  and YouTube  I also have a large collection of CDs so I can listen to them as well  My only complaint is the time it takes to read CDs when you put them in  On some CDs it takes from 15 to 20 seconds to first read the CD  When the CD player eventually goes bad as they always do I ll still be able to use the system with my phone 
We use it on both HD and normal recording  the playback quality is very good 
I installed it in a kia sorrento 2009  The apple carplay technology works perfectly
I purchased this because my wife works nights  so we often each watch TV  Hulu  actually  through our PS3 while the other tries to sleep in the next room  I figured this would be a way to do that  Unfortunately  the TV would need an adapter for bluetooth  and for whatever reason  Sony made their bluetooth audio only support in game chat  so it won t work for Hulu  Not the headphones fault  but something I didn t think to check beforehand  and the product description kinda suggests it should work for  That being said  it works great for listening to iTunes through the computer around the house while the wifey sleeps 
I would purchase another as I do like the product an use often
very good system enjoy the sound and functions that it has
Well worth the money  very good sound quality     
The remote handles all the components well and it is easy to program and setup 
Easy remote to program  Much better that having several remotes  All buttons on the other remotes are replicated on this one remote 
Possibly the best wifi adaptor you can buy  but is the size of an old flip phone and when connected to a laptop  can be bulky  Comes with a docking station and allows you to run a usb cable if wanted  Great signal strength and very fast speeds 
No lag   Connects quickly   No need for cables    
So far after a little bit of time using this wireless adapter it seems the be the best one I have found to date  Its super easy and quick to setup  drivers found on website for those without DVD drive  and provides a secure  very fast connection  The magnetic stand that come with is very useful and the magnet is strong so it wont move around  Nighthawk is some of the best products I ve seen and definitely recommend to everyone 
This is my 2nd Harmony remote  It replaced a AR that is no longer available and just started to have too many problems that I couldn t work around  It is easy to program if you ve done setup for this type remote before using USB and PC  Everything works well if you spend time programming it  If you just need to operate a tv and dvr you can get a cheaper remote and use a couple of codes  The Harmony s great if you want to control everything in a home theater and some home automation  It took me a few days to get used to the touch screen it s very sensitive compared to the AR  I m using it with the Hub and all components are hidden  No probs so far expect it to be as good as all Logitech products 
If you are an iPhone user this unit works just like the phone  Only cons at there aren t many apps that are CarPlay compatable  and without your phone it s really just a radio  A little pricey for its capability 
It was easy to program this remote  The keys are very large so it s easy to read  The staff at customer support were always wiling to teach me through the steps and were very oatient with me 
Really love not using batteries  Was able to put all of our equipment on ot 
I found this remote to be very simple to set up and it worked right away with no problems  I kind of wish that the play  fast forward  rewind  etc  buttons were on the bottom instead of the top as I seem to activate the touch screen a lot  But  just a minor complain  Highly recommend and it works with every device every time 
Great tv  Samsung is a good product  Very easy to setup and use 
This remote is extremely easy to set up and start using 
Great product  Set up was intuitive and logical  Makes combining several controllers a breeze 
This remote has some really great features  However it is hard to improve on the original in terms of button layout  The rewind and fast forward buttons being up top force you to learn how to use the touch screen swipe feature  The swipe feature is clever but it does not respond quickly enough most of the time  This remote is really all about the touch screen  It will take awhile to get used to 
My old slingbox pro had bit the dust and this one plugged in and went work immediately in the same place 
Very easy to attach to a wall  Very sturdy and the fit and finish is excellent  Easy to adjust the tilt with an allen screw on the back side  the template is fairly robust  not just a thin piece of paper like the one that came with my microwave oven  It is made in Eden Prairie  MN  One might think that the EdenPURE heaters are made in Eden Prairie as well  but nope  they re made in Canton  OH 
Just open the box  plug it in  Download the mobile app  open and check for camera on your home wifi  Select it and start viewing to make sure camera is showing desired view  If ok  off you go  You can view on your mobile device 
Excellant remote  and is easy to use  and the geek squad easily set it up to my Smart TV 
Easy to install works great  Rexommmend this to anyone with a surface pro
The Ultimate 30sec  skip FF will only accept one press at a time  Very disappointing  Switched back to my Harmony One 
This remote is very hard to work with because the buttons are so small and close together that we are always hitting the wrong button especially when trying to fast forwarding watching our DVR shows  Would never buy this remote again
The price for this speaker encouraged me to buy but the sound was actually worse than the laptops little tinny speakers 
Highly recommend  My many years of daily use attest to the reliability of these drives 
Great compact system for the price  However  in certain modes the minimum vol is still too loud   For example  I usually listen to the radio late at night  but even at the lowest volume setting it s still too loud for me to play  One workaround is to use a headset that has volume controls on it  
I got this mount because I just wanted to buy everything at once and be done with it  After I found that you can get the same type of product if not a better one for far far les 
I received a Slingbox as a gift from my tech savvy son  I must say that being able to access cable TV from my phone is very cool and the video quality is perfect 
This little remote is amazing  It controls my Samsung 4K TV  Dish receiver  Dish DVR  4K DVD player  and room lighting controls  The touch screen makes it simple  and the menus are straightforward  I ve always avoided getting a universal remote  but this little device has changed my mind 
Great stereo deck  Sounds very good  I have an iPhone and connect using USB cable  Still ok and good  Very cool product 
Great  Glad we purchased  So enjoy the review today 
I love this slingbox  Very useful and convenient  everytime i need to watch dodgers i can watch it
Easy to see display  helps with clutter only one remote on the table
Having an all in one remote reduces remote clutters on the coffee table which is a big plus  Being able to program channel favorites directly onto the touchscreen is a bonus  The only gripe I have is sometime it would not turn on something properly or it would not set it to the proper function  But this only happens around 1 per 250 times of using the remotes so i can live with manually walking to the source and turn on or changing to the correct function 

It is very comfortable and has a really good grip 
Great workmanship  Very comfortable to wear for long time  Not a noise canceling headphone but does block out some noise on the airplanes  Great for music 
Light weight easy to use and doubles as a case  Easy to take on and off 
I was looking at this tv and another brand tv   I decided to go with this one  It was very easy to set up and the picture is very clear
Great for starters  Very affordable and easy to use 
Great product  Sound quality is impressive  I can put it out by our pool and enjoy high quality background music while me swim  When it s inside  it can fill a room surprisingly well for such a small device  I also love the versatility of the bluetooth  google cast  and USB DAC  There are a lot of creative uses for this little guy  Recommended 
Very versatile control center for multiple devices in your home entertainment center  Take it room to room for single unit household control 
Easy to set up  Simple transition from wired to wireless 
Like the fact that that it is a charger  surge protector with multiple other uses and so portable  Would purchase again 
Verry easy to set up  Exactley what I hoped for  I stream pandora through it during workout sessions in my home made Gym  Lighting strobe effect comboes are nice and make you want to dance even more  Sounds better with Sub woofer on the ground  Its too much of a system for a shelf 
It works great  I purchased this jet pack to use when we are on vacation  I am happy that I did 
I bought this one to replace an older Jetpack  If you travel and need a mobile hotspot AND want to use your phone  this can be a solution  especially when you need faster Wi Fi than the  Free Wi Fi  offered at hotels that is slower than dial up Easily connect multiple devices without slowing the response time Includes a power supply  and can be recharged with the supplied cable using any USB port  e g    Car adapter or computer USB port 
Key travel is far superior to that of the SP3 Type Cover  The finger print reader is a nice touch  but it doesn t recognize my finger about 30% of the time
Vary easy to program   love the recharge option place charging stand when trough for the night always ready the next day  pair well with all my devices
This hotspot seems to operate in the manner for which it was purchased   No disappointment  
The keyboard is just that  a keyboard  Its got a magnetic connection into the bottom of the Surface Pro 4  However there are times when it just does not function  I m not sure if this is a keyboard issue or a tablet issue but either way its a major PITA  Sometimes the keyboard will not work as soon as you connect it into the tablet  Sometimes it will just stop working mid typing session  Due to the amount of glitches I have experienced with the Surface Pro 4 I am inclined to believe it is a tablet problem  However  after replacing my Surface Pro 4 with a brand new one I still experience the same glitches with the keyboard  I will say I have not replaced the keyboard at all so I may just have a faulty product 
I ordered 8 of these drives for some QNAP NASes and did not have any problems out of them  They are definitely better quality than the Green and Blue WD drives 
I purchased 3 of these drives for use in a home NAS  DROBO5N   BBY had them on sale and it was a great price  The drives have been awesome and no problems  It was so easy to set them up  I also did some research and these WD Red drives got great reviews in the tech blogs as very reliable for NAS use 
Works good for grandmother in nursing home  We are happy 
One of the features i with was on the remote would be the numbers to manually press the channel you want 
If you are looking for a mid priced universal remote that trumps all others you have found the remote  Great features and customization to your liking 
This is a quality keyboard  It is well designed  easy to use  and has many great features 
This remote was purchased as an upgrade remote for my Home Control Hub  My original remote had been lost  At first  I was concerned about paying the price for this remote as an upgrade to my hub  However  I have been very pleased with the ease of set up  use  and general performance  This remote seamlessly integrated with my current My Harmony devices and has been great 
Had to return  although we were told that this box would connect to our current cable system it did not 
This is the keyboard that I use when I travel with this device  Not for heavy typing but much better than the on screen kkeyboards 
Keyboard is very convenient  The finger print scanner is very helpful  However  it doesn t respond to fingerprint once in a while  We need to reattach the keyboard to surface pro and it works like a charm 
Very useful as it is light and comfortable to use  Instead of typing on the screen make the experience more enjoyable and productive  The fingerprint is handy and helps avoid having to type the password everytime 
This particular TV won t remain connected to the internet
Great tapes    glad they still sell them   good quality
I used four of these for ambient listening in our open living space  For the price these sound amazing and will get very loud  We have them paired with a Klipsch 12  sub and they compliment each other well  I just wish the grill installation was a little cleaner or if they were magnetic like other brands offer 
Use it for tunes on my boat  songs from iPad or iPhone get played on the boat so no need to carry CDs with me 
First I had to wait to have this product shipped to the store near me since that store did not carry them  When I finally got the speakers  they did not work  This item does not include some kind of receiver or remote and if you want to mount the speakers to the wall or hook them up to some stands then you are going to have to purchase special adapters for each speaker that costs about  35 45 for ea speaker  Horrible experience so I returned this product and got some Klipsch speakers instead and now I m happy 
Very happy with this model   no IR needed         
Upgraded from older version and I love it  It takes a little but getting used to the touch screen but we really love it  Make sure to get the hub if your devices cannot all be reached by the remote   
This worked perfectly on my SURFACE PRO 3 and gave me fingerprint reader functionality
Harmony remote works well  It was easy to set up from our older settings  Also was easy to add new items 
UPDATE After posting my original review I received an email from the staff at Logitech  what a surprise  They emailed me somethings that would help and it work  It was awesome that someone for Logitech would reach out to me over a simple remote  it would have been very easy for them to just not respond  Thank you it is greatI am extremely disappointed in this report  I bought it at Best Buy and was told it would work thru cabinet doors that are glass  no such luck  If I do not point this remote in the exact location no go  also when trying to change channels using the number keypad it is absolutely terrible sometimes it works most times not  At this point not a fan 
This one is up in the air  it seems like a good but it doesn t seem well executed  I ve basically used all Harmony remotes each with very minimal issues  tweaking settings  but nothing a little programming and a sync couldn t fix  All with the exception of the Elite model  it s very tempting but the price is not premium I want to fork over if it ends up like the Ultimate One model  this is a nice remote and a bit of a conundrum in itself with other issues  The layout and ergonomics are not pleasing to hold and use  although I can use the top video controls  play  pause  rewind  FF  etc   I rest my middle finger and index finger between the little fin on the bottom  still a klutzy feel  I ve been using this for about two week  I m working with it  I had to setup the swipe lock for the screen because my palm wrecks my entire viewing experience with just a light brush of skin to screen contact  The ability to fully customize the pages would be nice  other than changing a background picture adding and deleting favorite channel icons The make it or break it part  when I return it will be because of the activities I set up  It s getting old when you switch between activities and one or more component either responds when it shouldn t or doesn t respond at all  My programming is right  I have or currently use at least three of the lower tier remotes  It s frustrating for over 200 dollars  a 40 50 dollar pricetag wouldn t burn me so much  This Ultimate One remote has problems pretty much all the time  Once  a message popped up and told me a sync error  it was hung up for thirty minutes  The message told me to unplug  plug the remote and restart sync  it took maybe two minutes after that  I do it now each time it gets hung up for more than ten minutes I unplug it and restart the sync  two minutes and I m fixed for that moment  I ll use my 350 s  650 and 700 remotes because it s beginning to look like those are my only reliable options This is a nice remote  but everything I mentioned above will cut its lifespan short in my home  I desperately would love to try the Elite model but don t want to deal with another letdown  I ve heard that customer service is mostly overseas  that s lovely when you need help on a complicated  technical device  Always a pleasure  The 12 month warranty is a little scary as well  2 days out of warranty  we can t help you  These  all  companies are consistently cheapening materials and other components  making customer service lousy so everybody will give up and go fork out more money for replacements  I ll go back to using the individual component remotes  I m still up in the air about this remote  Again I would love the Elite model but 367 days later and it bites the dust  I would not be very happy 
So so sound  but more importantly  the speaker emitted a high pitch squeak when it wasn t plugged in to power  Returned to store 
Do not buy this unit if you plan on standing it on a table with its flimsy  unstable legs  I had it on a table with my cable box  Bumped into the table and the television fell over onto the cable box and damaged the television s screen  Don t know why Samsung went away from the base stands that they use to have 
I have to hit the reset button every single time I want to pair this device  I haven t had this issue with other Sony Bluetooth speakers  It s like the device forgets my phone and will be stuck in connecting mode  A 180 piece of junk if you ask me 
Great having 18GB of memory   Only problem was  every time I opened a rpogram got  memory allocation  errors and then system rebooted  It ws exactly the memory that the pc required  Put original memory back and not a problem   except its only 8GB   
Owned several bluetooth speakers  but this blows every other one way out of the water The flashing lights are not necessary  but you can simply turn them off The bass is very powerful Will be getting extras to link them together Seriously amazing sound 
Not a replacement for broadband internet I purchased this Unlimited data plan 4G 6620L MIFI to use as my Internet provider as I travel across North America in a motorhome  Not a good solution for streaming Amazon fire sticks or uploading Utube videos Back to the drawing board
This remote is OK  I have numerous Harmony models in my home and office  I bought this one to set up a new system in my office  I miss not having number buttons    on the ultimate you have to swipe screen a couple of times to get to the number screen  but it s still not as easy as having buttons  My biggest complaint is the battery life  With a full charge it s fine for a day or so  indicating it has an almost full charge  I can come to work the next day and the remote is completely dead and must be recharged  The screen isn t staying on so it shouldn t be that the screen is draining the battery  It was doing this right out of the box  I would look for a different model if I were you 
We got this remote to replace our first Harmony that finally died after many years of service  This one gives us the ability to use it with more devices  and our Geek Squad tech did an outstanding job of setting it up  This device is more compact than our other one  so we have to be more precise when pressing the buttons  While we are still getting used to the new features  we are glad we made this purchase 
Nice compact device that can control new as well as old equipment 
Really nice and useful but very tiring to configure  I returned it back 
nice  but probably get all the same things with the  70 remote
I have purchased 7 of these between two Lenovo Ts440 Servers  one is for a replacement  So far they have all been performing just fine  I have had no issues and I would recommend these drives  Western Digital does have a new version out now 
and I watch it in Florida  I can watch what I DVR 
This bag is great for travel because it does not open when you are wearing it 
Good to have on the go for a charging option  but provides a slow charge to the phone 
An absolutely amazing device  Has two 3 pronged wall outlets and one USB charging port  Although  the 3 000 mAh battery is only useable on the USB port  I like the additional mAh and surge protector that comes along with this device  Great for traveling  airports or even if you just need a quick boost of power on your phone or tablet  The 3 pronged outlet that charges into the wall flips down so it won t snag on anything if it s in your computer bag or travel bag 
After 1 hour using it feels like they were crushing my ears    also equalizer app needs improvements
I m not only music fan  but a musician as well  I know good sound when I hear it and this LITTLE speaker sounds 10 times larger than it really is  Powerful sound and really great bass  and if that s not enough  I got it on sale too Buy one  or more  and you won t be disappointed 
It s amazing how a small investment can make it seem like you have an entirely brand new computer  That s what the PNY Anarchy memory did for an old ish  desktop  Extremely easy to install  that all depends upon how easy it is to get to your memory slots in my case  simplicity   There s absolutely no comparison now between how it used to lollygag along and how it literally zooms  I m sure for folks with the latest and greatest and best of everything  it will seem like a noticeable speed improvement  For the rest of us  though  who have to make do with what we ve got  computer wise  the change in how responsive the computer is will be breathtaking When you re on a budget anything in the 100 range isn t cheap  But when you see the difference in how your old computer behaves and responds  believe me  you will agree it is worth the money 
I compared this to all of the display units in two separate Best Buy stores just for a sanity check  There is no question for the money it sounds better than the other major speaker makers by far  You wouldn t necessarily think this about Sony speakers  I can vouch for that  but I am telling you this speaker is perfect if you are looking for something portable that you can listen to LOUD or soft and still sound very very good  It s got a little weight to it  but that just makes it feel solidly made  Sony takes a lot of moonshots and this is one that I think is very worthy 
The quality of materials and sound clarif clarity is unmatched  Listening to HD tracks or Bluray Audio is amazing 
After owning a Logitech 550  and then the One  and neither lasting for more than a couple years  I decided to give Logitech one more chance when I bought the Smart Control model  non Ultimate  on a Black Friday deal  My biggest complaint with both models was that after a couple short years  or less   they just did not seem to work as well   either signals became weaker  or macros got corrupted  not sure   but especially considering the cost of the One  I was not impressed with the durability Enter the Smart Control  not Ultimate  model  which I finally ponied up for after getting so frustrated with the One  where the range seemed to deteriorate over time  which is just amazingly frustrating  The Smart Control to me  represented the pinnacle of the line to date  until I was able to review the Ultimate  which resolves pretty much every complaint I have about the non Ultimate version Make no mistake  both are great  but the Ultimate IMO  really is worth that extra cost due primarily to the following differences 1  Ultimate adds the touch screen of course  which solves the problem of having to use a phone to fix issues  automated help when the macros don t do what is expected   but of course also gives you access to all the detailed functions missing on the simple remote included with the non Ultimate model 2  Charging station  I really liked this about the One  and I guess due to having a screen  it s more crucial to have this than with the non Ultimate version  which does not include a station  It s also just a good place to keep the remote so I always know where it is 3  Backlit keys  Seemingly small thing  but for me personally  this is a HUGE deal  and one of the biggest reasons I prefer the Ultimate over the non Ultimate 4  Haptic feedback and tilt sensor  Again  small things  but both add to the advantage of the Ultimate  They are nice to have  features that really helps the Ultimate get that extra nod over the non Ultimate And of course  the success of both of these remotes is the Smart Hub  IMO  Even if you aren t sitting far away  or have devices in wall  or behind cabinets  this hub I think is the real key to the success over the previous models like the One and its predecessors  So nice to not have to worry about PS3 integration  not to mention the success rate of the macros working properly has increased to probably 95  I would say about 50 for the One Overall  the Ultimate One represents years of development and tweaking  and IMO  has resulted in an excellent remote to top the line Can t recommend enough  if you can get past the spendy price  but I really don t see any other alternatives in the market with this kind of functionality at this price point 
Love this  I put all of our other  half dozen  remotes away and we only use this  Even the grandparents can figure it out when they re visiting  Sometimes the macros are slow  Programming takes some time and attention to detail  But the biggest draw back is the rechargeable battery dies every few days  Would love it if we could just pop in a couple of AAs that would last all year 
I love  love  love this remote  I must say that I am still working to get used to it but it is by far the best ever  I purchased 2 of them   one to use in my great room and the other in my home studio 
Compared to all of the other Logitech Products I have owned  including numerous mice  keyboards  and three Harmony Ones  the Ultimate One performs surprisingly poorly with regard to its programming software Maybe once I get it working it will work OK  but that will never excuse the following  1  Would not work on a Win 7 64 bit Home Premium computer  failed with multiple download errors  Unexpected or Unknown error   try again  downloading the Harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app 2  Would not work on a Win 7 32 bit Ultimate computer  failed with the same multiple download errors downloading the Harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app 3  Finally installed on a Win 8 1 computer  retrieved my info from previous Harmony One  or did I  can t confirm this  none of the supposedly retrieved settings are ones I have used in several years  yet failed to retrieve settings for watching TV or Bluray  e g  my DirecTV One or DirecTV Two receivers  e g   Watch TV  or Bluray activities  Sony Bluray   which of course are the primary activities for which I purchased remote  For 250 after 2 hours with basically no progress to me that is worse than useless  I have wasted precious family time without any satisfaction for which I purchased remote  I seek products that work as advertised without unsolvable complications  e g   unexpected error  unknown error  no tech support available  no Google threads regarding error messages  implicit solution  buy  try another computer   If I were a teenager this conundrum might be interesting  but as it is  I do not have lots of spare time to tinker with problems caused by engineers who release products that are not ready for prime time  Oh and by the way Logitech keeps more or less banker s hours  i e   Monday through Friday 8 to 5 so forget about tech support unless you don t have a job By way of comparison  it used to take me 20 minutes to program the Harmony One  with the Ultimate One and 2 hours into the project  all I can control is the volume on the AV amplifier Wish I had never had reason to make an acquaintance with Ultimate One  unless you have lots of time to kill I recommend that you avoid it and wait for next iteration of Harmony remote  or seek alternative company s remote if available As piece of hardware  the Ultimate One may have promise  If I get out of the woods with the software  I will post the results Addendum  04  19  14  OK  now that the remote is programmed  I love this remote  Overall I prefer Logitech products  e g   Razer mouse  K400 illuminated wireless keyboard  Squeezebox Touch  Harmony One   no design is perfect given that compromises are always necessary  but I tend to prefer their solutions  so I have high expectations  As for the Harmony Ultimate  I like the form factor including the decreased size from the One  perhaps the DVR buttons should be on the bottom but it does not bother me as it does others  and the flexibility and power of the programming is a definite leap forward  I haven t yet tried the onscreen leap forward  jump back buttons  but if I don t like them  I can always program two of the colored buttons at the bottom to perform those functions  For me it was not that hard to program  I just needed to take a break after all the initial frustration when the software would not install If it were not for the install glitches I would give the Ultimate One a 5 out of 5 stars  As my experience got off to such a rocky start and others may not own computers with a variety of Operating Systems in order to troubleshoot MyHarmony software install issues  and lack of evening  weekend technical support  4 stars is is as high as I can go I believe seamless compatibility with Win7 should be a given  although I suppose you could try and blame Windows  but for a company as widespread as Logitech it seems they should be able to do a lot better  FWIW the Win8 1 computer is not my favorite  but I purchased it a year after Win 8 was released in order to attempt to keep up with the times  and this is the second occasion it has come in handy i e   when my daughter had to do violin tests for public middle school orchestra  the Smart Music app failed with an incomprehensible error  same problem with only daytime M F tech support  and no searchable threads to explore any solutions  So we installed SmartMusic on the new all in one portable Win 8 1 Dell and never looked back  problem solved 10  12  14 Still mostly love this remote  my vote remains 4 1  2 stars In case it hasn t already been answered via other threads  the DirecTV jump forward  back button functions  approx 30 sec forward  7 seconds back  if memory serves  do still exist on this remote but they are indeed hidden by an Android style tap versus press  hold gesture  i e   tapping the FF or RW button brings up the fast forward  rewind functions  e g   1 4 taps equals 1 4 times speed for FF  RW  whereas press  hold brings up the jump forward  back functions  with a vibrate signal to indicate success in accessing the press  hold feature  so you know when to let go  found these functions by accident one day when I pressed and held the buttons a bit too long  one second I suppose  My only real gripe with this remote now is that occasionally I press the power off button when I am trying to press the rewind button it would be nice if the power button was a bit more physically isolated from the RW button if you don t watch TV every day sometimes your tactile grasp of where the buttons are on the remote is less secure  and you really don t need to power off without having to look at the remote Bottom line and in contradiction of other reviews regarding the tactile layout of the remote  it is still excellent without need for visual guidance once you learn the layout and compares well to that of the Harmony One  really  who needs physical number buttons when you re watching DVR  and easy to operate  even if you are working out on an elliptical machine while watching TV  I might add 
I ve been using a Harmony 880 for a bunch of years  Finally the buttons to select an activity and its associated controls started becoming intermittent and it was time to find something else  I looked at the Harmony Ultimate hub and its associated controllers WiFi  but the limit of 2 IR repeaters vs  my multiple drawer layout just wouldn t work for me  I finally settled on the Ultimate One  the drawers have glass fronts  I downloaded the new MyHarmony app   I d been using the older Java app for years  but decided to give this one a try   especially since it claimed to be able to transfer from my old heavily customized 880   and it did  About 95 of all the customized buttons came over  I needed to re assign the color keys at the bottom  but that was easy to do The one glitch I had was in setting up Favorites   I failed to notice that the Favorites also automatically invokes one of your activities  which would typically be  Watch TV    Unfortunately  that s not the one it defaulted to  After setting up all of the Favorites  I was wondering why it kept starting  Watch DVR  when I touched a favorite   RTFM  The unpleasant part came when I could find no way to go back and change that without removing all of the Favorites  a call to Tech Support at 6PM EDT came back with a recording that TS was closed   please call back between 9AM and 10 PM     Anyhow  after re doing the setup everything was fine   except the channel logos were blurry and relatively ugly Enter www iconharmony com   a great site for almost every channel logo imaginable  I downloaded some 35  logos from them  and sent the author a little contribution via PayPal for his efforts  and uploaded those icons via MyHarmony  They look a whole lot better   I don t know why Logitech  Harmony can t start with them out of the box Similarly  the activity icons could use some help   a quick Google search turned up lots of icon sites I downloaded new icons and re sized them to 70x70 using Photoshop  but there are a lot of apps that can resize images  You then upload them via MyHarmony All in all  it took several hours worth of time at the computer   and that was with all of the activities and devices already defined from my 880  But at least part of that was my fault for not checking the Favorites Activity and then for wanting better looking icons The other thing I ve noticed is that the Ultimate 1 seems to have a broader IR beam   I don t need to be quite as careful in aiming it as with the 880 As many others have commented  I also wish it had physical number buttons  but I ve not found it that difficult to swipe the screen to get the number panel up  Similarly  the FF  Play  Pause buttons at the top haven t seemed to be such a nuisance as others have described   but I m used to using 2 hands with the remote  I also found it easier to move  Menu Edit  the Favorites icons around on screen on the remote vs  on the app Something that s a bit hidden away is the full device control   on the 880 you used the Devices button to bring up another screen which then gave you all of the learned device controls  On the Ultimate 1  you use the Menu Devices to get you to a similar screen of devices  the to their detail controls 
I own quite a few different speakers from portable Bluetooth speakers to home speakers with integrated voice assistants  The UE Megablast tries to be the jack of all trades  but falls a bit short UNBOXING The unboxing experience is simple and pleasant  Without getting into too much detail of the packaging  you re greeted with a speaker  a high quality flat microUSB cable  and an AC adapter  You can also purchase a charging dock separately which will allow you to drop the Megablast onto the dock for charging without fiddling with cables  Additionally  you can continue to use the Megablast while charging SETUP To setup the Megablast  I downloaded the Ultimate Ears app on my smartphone and opened it up  After ensuring Bluetooth was enabled on my smartphone  I turned on the Megablast  From there  you can pair using the app or your phone s pairing menu  After pairing over Bluetooth  the app will continue the setup process The Wi Fi connectivity setup process is simple  but only if your home network situation is typical  Ultimate Ears recommends having separate SSID s for each network  e g  MyWiFi 2 4GHz  MyWiFi 5GHz  so that the Megablast doesn t get confused during setup  I found that following this recommendation led to a successful setup for the Wi Fi connectivity  After selecting your network and entering the password  you re also given the opportunity to login to Amazon Alexa for the voice assistant functionality  The app will also install any firmware updates during this process APP Once the setup is complete  the app is very simple  You have the ability to turn off the microphone for Alexa to work  and you have the ability to see the battery status  Wi Fi connection status  Bluetooth connection status and Alexa sign in status  You also have the ability to switch Wi Fi networks  switch Amazon accounts for Alexa integration  or unpair  forget the Megablast  Lastly  you can change the idle time before shutdown  the speaker language  and toggle firmware auto updates MEGABLAST HARDWARE The Megablast is pretty simple  It has a power button with an LED in it  a pairing button  and volume down  up buttons  And of course  the 360 degree sound people love so much paired with an IP67 water resistance rating for splashes and even a bit of submersion  However  it does not have a 3 5mm jack�a feature found on the smaller UE BOOM AUDIO QUALITY Like the BOOM speakers that preceded it  the Megablast has sparkly highs  clear mid range  and punchy bass  However  the Megablast starts to fall short at the highest volumes  as compression kicks in to prevent clipping  distortion in the bass frequencies  This is due to the fact that the EQ really pushes the bass on the Megablast  but like any other Bluetooth speaker  it can only physically handle so much�so to prevent damage  it compresses the bass at a certain threshhold  When this happens  the bass sounds either anaemic or uncontrolled  I do want to stress that this happens to most portable Bluetooth speakers  and the Megablast far from the worst of them Despite this  if you re listening to spacious  dynamic music  then the Megablast will sound fantastic at most volumes  I have gotten the chance to listen to progressive rock  metal  acoustic  swing jazz  big band jazz  EDM and more  Music with more dynamic instrumentation really shines on the Megablast  Music with a constantly hot master may start to lose its clarity when the Megablast is set to its highest volumes  But overall  an excellent listening experience ALEXA INTEGRATION I m not a fan of Alexa  personally  I find that switching between Bluetooth and Alexa is not seamless  Once I call out  Alexa   the Megablast disconnects from Bluetooth  so I have to pair my phone again if I want to use it  Despite this  you can use Alexa with a limited number of unpopular streaming services  You can control Alexa s volume  but not your Bluetooth volume  You also can t ask for the battery status using Alexa  It helps to think of Alexa as a standalone assistant that knows nothing of its existent in the Megablast  When using Alexa  the  Megablast  is irrelevant  It only knows whatever Alexa knows and can only do whatever Alexa can do�except stream from Spotify for some reason  So the lesson here is that if you are using Alexa  don t expect Bluetooth connectivity to resume  Just stick to Alexa s Amazon Music  iHeartRadio  and TuneIn streaming over Wi Fi  Oh  and just so we re clear  Alexa only works over Wi Fi CONCLUSION   FINAL THOUGHTS So  is it worth the price? I m not sure  I own portable Bluetooth speakers in the same price range  and the Megablast packs a better sound and more volume  but its Alexa integration is half baked and its missing the integrated voice that tells the battery status when you hold both the volume up and down buttons at the same time  On top of that  you can t do party mode with multiple Megablasts  you can t do remote power on  and you can t change the EQ  These are all features of the smaller UE BOOM  so I m rather confused as to why these features aren t available on the Megablast  If you re buying this speaker for the Alexa integration  forget it  But if you want a great Bluetooth speaker with a few missing features compared to its smaller siblings  this could be the one to rock your parties 
The UE Megablast speakers live upto its name with quality and really loud sound from an ultraportable form factor  The speakers come very nicely packaged and look premium out of the box  The inside box has unique artwork and really looks good  The box opens in half with paperwork on the left with information on the app to download for ios and android  Underneath the manuals you can find the charger and the cable The speaker has an excellent rubbery feeling to it  The front has large volume up and down buttons  The top has a small pairing button and a large power button  The bottom has the micro usb charging cable as well as the connection to a dock The sound from this speaker can get really loud and easily fill a large room  We really like the 360 sound  The base is a little high but still the speakers sound very balanced  The app is an easy add on and complements the speaker well  Alexa was easy to setup and worked flawlessly  However just like any other alexa enabled speaker when the sound is loud it is difficult to get alexa to hear your commands  Our one year old is a big fan of alexa and really fascinated by our interaction The charging base works flawlessly as well and the speaker runs about 7 8 hours on a single charge This is an excellent alexa speaker from UE and delivers on all aspects 
I got it as a free replacement for a Harmony One that had an exploding battery  I thought great they are standing behind their product when I accepted it  but this is horrible  It s an ergonomic disaster  It actually takes two hands AND two eyes to use because it s so badly laid out  I don t get why they created two sets of buttons separated by the touch screen  I like the bottom feel and curve of the remote  but the top edges are too sharp and the nice fit to my palm is defeated by the fact that I need to move the remote up and down so I can reach the buttons  And I have pretty long fingers  Seriously  this is so awkward I don t think I ll use it much 2  11  15 UpdateDropped to 1 star as the product has a design defect  I noticed that the remote makes a fairly loud buzz when the backlight is on  So I called Logitech and their first response was to show me how to turn the button highlight off  That did work  but then you cannot see the buttons in the dark  Clearly this was a known issue  I kept saying that I wanted the backlight to work  After a few minutes delay she told me it was a known defect that engineering was working on  She would put my name on a list for replacement when they figured it out  I asked her to keep the ticket open until I received the replacement  She said OK  I repeated this again before hanging up and she said OK again  2 minutes after hanging up I get an email that says since I ve put your name on the list I m closing this ticket  She could have told me the truth when I had her on the phone  Sigh  Cannot recommend this remote until they figure out their design flaw  My hearing is not great and it didn t really bother me that much  but my kids don t want to use it because the noise is so annoying 9  22  2015 UpdateEventually I contacted them again about the noise and they did send me a new remote that fixed the noise problem  So I changed this back to 2 stars  The remote is functional and it looks good  but where the original One was a joy to use this is still and ergonomic disaster 
Programmed it myself  didn t work  Had Geek Squad out twice     still doesn t work  A waste of  250 
This is about like all the other Harmony remotes  It works about 50% of the time  It routinely misses signals when executing commands  I have to manually keep my other remotes handy for when it fails to turn something on or off properly  No amount of tweaking in the settings or online help has resolved the issues  I returned this item and purchased the Harmony Hub  It works much more consistently   is Alexa compatible  I have yet to have the Hub fail to send the proper commands  The Hub is much more reliable   it included an RF remote too  In my opinion  the Harmony Hub is a much better alternative to this 
Feels a little cheap but surprisingly it holds up great  Fingerprint works 90% of the time  Not the most comfortable to type on for long periods of time 
Overall the quality of the type keyboard is improved very well  It no longer feels like it is bending when you type  Construction appears to be better  Time and use will tell 
The keyboard is great and there s more space to type  The fingerprint is cool to have but needs more work doesn t always read my finger 
I paid over 160 for this piece of equipment that was supposed to make my life easier  It did nothing of the kind  I like many other of the reviews that I have read here have owned many Logitech remote controls in the past  They were simple they were easy to program and they were fuss free  This unit has none of those attributes When I receive this unit I immediately log on to the Logitech site and put the model numbers for my television  Soundbar and surround sound comma Blu ray player and the sinking went without incident and I started using the new remote control  I started noticing deficiencies  It would raise and lower the volume on my soundbar but could not mute it  You could not skip 30 seconds at a time while watching the DVR as my Genie remote could do  You could not use any of the smart TV attributes of my Samsung 8000 series television  So today I called and was promised by a mr  Wang that at the end of his interminable message he would give me his Direct email address so that I can address any issues with him  Of course that never happened  During the 40 minutes that I waited on hold every one minute I would get a message telling me that I should go to their Community boards or to their website has all the information I would ever need would be there  Finally I got somebody on the phone he assured me that he would be able to fix my problem without any issues  So I followed his instructions and wasted another half hour of my life  Once the think was completed he asked me to press the activity watch TV  Instead my TV went off my Blu ray player came on my soundbar became very loud and my genie DVR was shut off even though it is set up never to go off by the Logitech programming  At that point I think the gentleman for his help and explain to him that I will be typing a complain on my Logitech keyboard to Amazon using my Logitech mouse  I also explained that these would be the last Logitech products I would ever buy  He suggested that I consider buying their new 299 super duper remote control  I am declining his offer  There are better universal remote controls for a lot cheaper than this  Stay away from this unit 
Didn t see a use for it  I did buy a simpler Harmony  the 650 Rich
Does not work properly  very hard to setup  support is very funky or just not there 
I hoping this radio cicuit board is water sealed like they said cicuit board is exposed to elements  
I like the tv but had send it back due to a defect  Something was wrong with the sound 
needs more devices to be more effective   out of stock everywhere  and not s friendly interface     
No software update for this  description not clear on age of device 
Prepare for some frustration
slow reponse 
The item that I bought seems not new And I paid for a new remote    
Very touchy and complicated 
I wanted to be able to sling my DTV signal to a roku tv using a new Samsung Tablet as remote control over my home wifi network   Before I bought these components I spoke with Sling support twice to assure it was a viable  I was told they recommended the use of a tablet as a phone s display was too small to serve as a remote control  It has been 2 months and the integration of these products does not yet work  The necessary  cast icon  never appears on the tablet to initiate the sling of the video  I have been escalated to level 3 support three weeks ago and there has never been a response  Then I read in their support forum that the issue has been around for 4 months before I bought the equipment  No resolution in sight  Today  I was told by Sling level 2 support that it also does not work with the Google Chromcast  as is advertised    Sling acknowledges that this is a widespread issue and not native to my set up  network or equipment  Buyer Beware
UPDATE     Bottom Line Up Front  DON T BUY SONY MARINE PRODUCTS  Corrosion formed over two weeks on a brand new unit     enough corrosion to void the manufactures warranty  I can only assume that the advertising on the anti corrosion coating is EXTREMELY exaggerated or that this is a manufacturing defect  my contention with them   After this experience  I will not even CONSIDER a Sony marine ANYTHING  It is NOT manufactured correctly to handle use on water This radio was a disappointment for a very specific reason  It failed within a month of first usage  Even worse  the warranty REPLACEMENT unit failed less than a month after installing it  The first unit s failure was the inability to leave demo mode  i e  making it useless  The second unit s failure was more spectacular     a blown fuse on the water leaving a nice toxic smoke behind the control panel  This was followed by the blowing of a replacement fuse back on shore when power was reapplied  Obviously  something in the unit has a major short    the second fuse blew immediately  produced some arcing  and a nice puff of toxic smoke Kudos to Sony on the first replacement process  No so good on this second replacement  At least it s under warranty  and I bought an Amazon extended warranty  too  When it worked  the sound was good with plenty of volume without distortion  Bluetooth with an iPhone worked fine but it was slightly cumbersome getting them paired  It was easy to read in the bright sunlight and fairly easy to operate  Tuning FM could be a challenge but once I got it going  it wasn t that difficult If I were to do this over  I would NOT buy this radio  Instead  I would spend the additional money on a Sonichub 2 to work with my Lowrance unit and put a plate over the hole in my boat s dash 
Purchased the TV mount to hang my 52  television above our fireplace  Instructions were easy to understand for installation but the hardware provided to mount to the way was specifically for a home with wooden studs  I had to buy additional hardware to accommodate a home with metal studs  Other than that  its doing its job 
Very easy to install and supports our TV well  Great Product 
Samsung has a reputation for having great a great picture  This TV is no exception 
Good quality picture  will tell anyone to purchase this tv my grandson loves it 
I travel so I can have the same controls on my laptop and phone as if it was my TV in the house  All channels  all features available  Great for catching up on games when the hotel TV channels are limited
Love this sling box  It s easy to setup  Now I can watch cable TV anywhere on my iPhone  The only thing is that one person could connect to the box at one time  The app is free to download and the signal is in HD quality 
Mounted this unit on the wall  then realized that the height of the TV is not centered on the mount  it s about 6 lower on the mount that I expected  As a result  I have an exposed outlet on the wall  above the mount  that I thought would be hidden had the tv s height been centered based on the holes I drilled in the wall to mount the Sanus unit 
Love my TV  it�s a 40 in  it�s just the right size for me  Clear viewing  colors are clear and bright  good price for this 40 in samsung
very happy with my purchase  you don t know what you re missing until you get a long overdue upgrade 
I bought two about a month ago because I wanted to connect our desktops to the home network   it is working great and connected very easily 
When I was listening to these in the store they sounded great  When I was listening to these at home  they fell a little flat in comparison  My guess is that demo mode was much louder but ultimately I wanted more from them  They have a great sound and I like the lights associated  Solid speakers but I d recommend bose or jbl before these 
All the others I tried were difficult to set up and one even scared our pet  This petcam has 800 number to help you and only costs  3 per month to keep movies for 24 hours   you don t have to pay if you don t like    wanted to see how pet took off a shirt and voila  Watched the videos from day after home from work and it was no longer mystery   
Item works well except the face is touch sensitive 
Received on time and as advertised  Prefer bottoms to touch screen  You can easily hit the wrong command on the touch screen if you are no looking directly at it 
This is my fifth Harmony remote and the first one I have not been happy with  I thought I would like the touch screen functionality but it just didn t work for me  It was too slow to respond to the commands  For example I would pull up they key pad and want to go to channel 1210  It would take about three tries to get the remote to respond to the commands  I would press 1 2 1 0 and it would not register one of the numbers  I guess I just miss the actual number pad with raised buttons where you can use it without having to look at the remote Well why not just use the favorite channel functionality and just press one button to go to your desired channel I tried this too  Same result  It would not register all the numbers half the time  You would have to be very deliberate and slow with it and for the price of the remote I was just not satisfied 
The touch screen does not work when pressed on occasion  Sometimes it will go to another page instead of the commands on the page you are trying to use
Touch screen failed 2 months after very light use  I followed all troubleshooting tips and reset to factory settings twice  The Harmony remotes are usually rock solid   but this one died well before its time 
The new keyboard with Touch ID works great for my Surface Pro3  It was easy to install and is easy to use on a daily basis for my job 
Had to slightly charge before using  but it works great  I can change it  my phone and stream music from my phone at the same time
I am pretty tech savy  and love the idea of total control with 1 remote  I already had a harmony remote  but decided to upgrade with this total touch screen  and capability of controlling more devices  This remote is not worth the  200 difference from the lower grade model    It does not hold a charge very good  and with the touch screen you have to swipe and swipe  screen is to small and to navigate is a chore  I thought I could put device remotes away  but keep them accessible bc battery sucks   Save your money  this remote is garbage for the price    
After we test it in our newly remodeled basement  we find we totally like it  The quality of the sound is amazing and the low price makes it even sweeter 
This is my second Harmony remote  650 was the first   The old still works great  but I wanted the extra features on this one  I was amazed what the device with just taking a little extra time to set it up on my laptop  It s convenient that it doesn t take batteries and I just put it on the charger while I sleep  about every 3 days  The COMPLETELY customizable led screen is my favorite part Considering the price  with all the new features  it was definitely worth it  The 650 has worked flawlessly for about 3 years and now we use it in the living room  Definitely worth it 
What a joke  Because you can t change the way this thing insists on turning EVERY device on and off every time you change Activities it is completely worthless for my pretty simple system  My receiver takes several seconds  about 10  to come on and won t accept commands from the remote before it is booted up  which Logitech should know   So when I use the canned activity Watch TV   the receiver ends up on the wrong input every time because the Harmony is trying to change it before the receiver is ready  No problem  I think  I can add a pause in between the the power on and change input commands  right WRONG  when you go into the customize activity section  the built in functions are starred and it explicitly states that you cannot change the default actions  only add to them  Okay  maybe I can leave the receiver off of the Watch TV program    But then I can t control the volume    Okay  maybe there s a way to just tell it to use the receiver volume all the time     Back over to the customize section     Nope  Okay  maybe I ll create a totally custom  Watch TV but then the Favorites won t work  man that s like half the reason I bought this 250 remote    Oh and it still doesn t handle the power  the most basic function of any piece of equipment  correctly so that doesn t solve anything  Oh and by the way  the software to load the settings to the remote crashes about one in five time you you use it which bricks the remote and you have to a soft reboot  hold the off and menu keys down for 20 seconds   And so begins a cascading set of compromises that ultimately renders the Logitech Harmony One a very INCAPABLE universal remote  not even as good as one that can be ordered from this very site for about 20  I ve played with this thing for a week and the only way I can make any use of it is to use the individual devices means of controlling things  like that good old 20 universal one   But becaeuse Logitech makes the cool features  like the Favorites dependent on their notion of Activities none of that works for me  Oh  and when you re looking at the touch screen for individual devices  The button descriptions take up the whole screen sooyou can only see 3 or 4 buttons at a time  making that pretty much worthless too  Well just the icons would do  maybe I can get rid of the descriptions    Back over to the customize section  you can change the label  but it can t be blank and you still only get one button per line      You see where this is going  Do yourself a favor and stick to the 20 model 
I ve had harmony remotes for a long time  Best was the 900  When it had a swollen battery  Logitech sent me this remote  I have tried multiple times to get it to work  texted logitech and they kept telling me a new upgrade or new download of software would make it work  So I tried all the fixes they recommended and it still doesn t work  Don t ever buy this remote 
It was terrible and I am very disappointed  especially after having the prior model I tried to sync it with my computer for over two weeks and the computer could not find it Then I tried three other computers with the same result  including a Mac No success  so I returned it  Amazon sent me another one which I received very quickly and painlessly  I had the same result with the second one  it simply would not sync  I went online looking for an answer  but nothing worked so I returned that one also  and got a refund  Now I am looking for another brand  because Logitech is hopeless  do not buy one  period 
I needed something strong to block out loud noises  These certainly do the trick  It was well worth the expense 
Excellent sound and battery life  Very comfortable to wear  No buyer s remorse here  Worth the price 
Loud  extra bass  can have up to like 10 bluetooth devices connected at one time  and the lights are such a plus  A  all around 
Great remote but it took awhile to set up don t know if I did it right but love the product
Got this to replace older Harmony One which I loved  I hate the all touch screen as it is hard to find the one you want and easy to accidentally touch a function you do not want  I finally bought a Harmony 665 which works much like the old Harmony One 
Had to return  Heavy tight and if you touched the area around the Mic  it made the speaker sound like it was cracked  Very annoying  I did like the sound of the speaker  when listening 
I bought it with expectation but found it was too tight for big ears and also not so comfortable  the sound quality is fine 
Almost needs to be on a flat surface or any slight unintended movement causes the cursor to jump and then you have to figure out what it has messed up 
Great wall mount  holds my 64 inch like a champ  the tilt feature came in handy because I had to hang it a little higher than I wanted it to be  Installation was a breeze 
Page up  down button doesn t work  Finger touch screen doesnT work all the time  Manual off Internet is useless  Too difficult to understand  Too complex 
The touch screen was not user friendly in my opinion  I love the Logitech line  but this one was not for me 
Sounds fine but I hate how complicated it is  Just where is the on  off button I hadd to read the directions just to figure out where to turn it on 
we now have 4 remotes to operate this new tv   this is a completely unnecessary item and I am going to return it  The problem is   it is the only remote that can turn on the tv as that is how the installer programmed it   all I want is 1 remote  
I am having all kinds of glitches  It rarely works like it should when you first turn it on 
I returned this item  I did want a flat screen mount that would allow me to turn the TV but this thing was HUGE and HEAVY  Plus it didn t match up to the back of my tv so I couldn t have mounted it if I had kept it 
First of all this really should not be considered a shelving unit  This thing is huge  It was much bigger than I needed or wanted  Second I thought it was quite complicated to figure out how to operate everything  This thing does a million and one different things  It s kind of like having your own dj  Again it was more than I wanted or needed  The biggest issue I had was that I really bought it for the bluetooth capability and it didn t work  No matter what I did it wouldn t connect to my iphone 6  So I had the joy of figuring out how to get it all back in the huge box properly and I got it sent back to amazon  The return was easy which is why I love Amazon so very much  Bottom line  the system may be a great system but it was just much more than I ever wanted 
Bought this headphone for my vacation  First problem  after taking it out of the box  it was very hard to setup  Second  It was too big and heavy to carry around  not very portable 
Tony u need a ground loop isolater  Once u get that no more feedback
the good   sound quality   tons of volume and clarity  and even at high  and i do mean *high*   this little guy pumps out the sound   volumes very little if any distortion  good spectrum top to bottom  nothing overly forward or distracting  just punchy and fun to listen to   alexa  wifi integration   the alexa integration may or may not be useful to all  if it is  having a portable speaker of this quality will certainly be a major plus  with an amazon prime music account  you don�t even need another device to play music   �alexa play foo fighters� brought up a nice shuffled mix of foo with nothing else attached to the speaker  even via bluetooth  pretty cool   design   attractive �360� design  rugged and waterproof battery life   rated at 16 hours at mid volume  and appears to be accurate the bad   pairing issues using my mac   pairing to my iphone was easy and quick  but for some reason pairing to my macbook pro had issues  i was never quite able to just use it as a bluetooth speaker with the laptop as i was with the phone   can�t keep continuously plugged in w  o the accessory charger   to me it�s a bit of a design flaw  probably necessary to keep the unit water tight  but in any case  the micro usb port is on the bottom of the speaker  meaning you can�t exactly keep it plugged in and charging unless you pay for the accessory charger dock   40   would�ve been nice to have this ability without the extra cost overall i would really like to give this speaker 4 5 stars  but since we are limited in our 5 star review system to only using full stars  i�ll round up and give it 5 stars  the sound quality alone at least justifies that much  just a couple minor issues short of a full 5 stars in my opinion  but highly recommended none the less 
Not a good product  Takes to long in just making channels changes 
My JBL charge 2 had some internal problems and I had the protection plan  so I used the  160 store credit to buy this for only 100  and wow is it way better  Sound quality is great and loud  and battery lasts all day when I use it at work 
Functions OK and had some promise  but Sony messed it up with their app integration and insistent Demo Mode that comes up  Faceplate bezel also does not want to stay on no matter how it is manipulated 
A little hard to get used to for those of us over 60 
a little too tedious to use  still have my separate remotes nearby 
Cumbersome
Decent remote  But at times freezes but once we put it to charging cradle it resets 
Do what it s supposed to do  Reaction time of the remote control can be faster 
good
Good average upgrade from stock speakers
Good book but limited in scope 
Had to go get a new remote controller because your remote didn t work  
Highs and mids are good but bass sucks
it is not super slim and it sticks out a good 6 8 inches from wall  super slim is misleading
Its a little glitchy at times
Just not user friendly enough for me  I couldn t get my dvr to work  Returned for a refund 
Not as good as my Logitech Harmony One 
Not too shabby but lacks a sleep timer which can be a headache when using at home
Ok remote
Remote worked excellent at the beginning then it must continuously be re calibrated  
still getting use to it
too complicated  returned 
Should have read the other reviews more closely  Wanted to be able to cast throughout my house  However the picture quality of the casting was not HD  Really can tell the difference watching sports  Decided to rewire part of the house instead  Might be OK for streaming remotely   but did not hit the mark for what I needed 
Thought this was similar to my previous Logitech Harmony remote which allowed me to change the channel with the remote pointed in any direction 
Thought they would project more sound considering they were  300 a piece and I bought 2 to go with the sound bar  Sirius music and some 4k movies project better but not too impressed for the price  They sounded awesome in the store  and it took a lot of convincing to get wifey to agree to buy them  Disappointed for the price most of the time 
My son accesses our satellite DVR programming from his college dorm room over wifi connection  No problems so far 
Set up was easy and worked right out of the box  It s small and doesn t take up much space which is a bonus  The only consideration is the wifi internet upstream  There are times when the screen freezes but the technology works great and worth it 
It is loud but not obnoxious  Can be heard throughout the house Been using for 1 month 
The reviews of this item were very good  which is why I chose it  I ve been more than happy with it  It connects very easily to Bluetooth enabled sources  such as my iPad and my iTouch  and these just have to be within thirty feet or so 
i can now keep in touch with him     phone is always charged    
The Geek Squad mounted my 65  TV using this wall mount  GS did a great job  and the wall mount can easily be adjusted for any angle up or down  or sideways  Adjusting the tilt or angle is very easy  takes no effort at all  Well worth the price 
I have been using Logitech items for quite a while from mice to previous remotes  I was offered the chance to review this item and my impressions are favorable 1  What s in the box You receive the remote  plus the charging cradle and a brief instruction booklet 2  Aesthetic  I have the previous Harmony One remote and in comparison this unit is smaller  It is simply much more compact  The first obvious difference is the lack of a numerical keyboard  Second  this unit is designed to sit vertically in the charger  as opposed to horizontally with the previous model   Also  the off button  and many of the buttons are quite a bit smaller  The bottom side has a nice  rough material that seems resistant to slipping 3  Use  First off  I charged the remote for a while  a couple of hours  before doing anything  Once I got the unit turned on  I was directed to add information  I must confess that because I had a previous Harmony  the process of adding information was simple  However  one positive aspect is the account for adding information  and that is adding the components of your system and needs by each activity  TV  DVD  videogame console  etc  has been moved off from a computer based server  to a cloud based server  I did need to upgrade my account to the cloud by registering  but the cloud seemed to understand my need to upgrade and simply asked for a connection through the included USB cord and transferred the information  Advantage While I have my laptop  if for some reason my laptop takes a dive  I can use another computer to upgrade my remote easily Actual use  Once I got everything squared away  I turned on the TV with the remote and began to figure this system out  This is quite a change from the previous remote  The touchscreen in the middle is a important part of the system  There are two buttons at the top   a star  for favorite channels  easy to set up based on TV provider and channels available  and a Home button for activities   Once the thing is on you can switch between favorite channels  activities  a number pad  and a command page by swiping around  Also  there is a swipe on the bottom for bringing up the gestures page which enables the user to pause  play and change volume  amongst other functions  Nicely  there are buttons on the remote that make the touch screen duplicative In many ways  this system is a huge improvement over the previous version  I was originally not able to understand the system  but after a bit of use  the ways of this remote become pretty intuitive  I love how you can easily go to things like a help function  more on that in a bit   a devices button and ways to adjust the remote on the fly without having to access the cloud to update the remote What things didn t I like  There are only a few things that are irritating on this remote based on my use  First off  I really wish that the remote didn t have the IR outlet on the bottom as opposed to the top like the previous remote  As this seems to be line of sight  which sometimes means that I have to hold the remote upwards rather than simply pointing  for some this is probably okay  but for me this seems dorky    UPDATE  Once I posted this review  someone thoughtfully pointed out that my supposed complaint about the IR sensor being on the bottom was incorrect and actually that button is for the remote learning function  In fact  I simply had to point the remote at the system as always  Guess what Using the remote with the remote pointed at the system worked extremely well  Gone were the second presses and the irritations that the remote would miss some function  It works and I haven t had a problem since  So this is NOT a problem at all Another irritation is that I think this remote makes it harder to have a older person or less techy person at the home as the help button is buried in the sub menu instead of being readily available for those not familiar with the system  Though this is not something that occurs often  it is something I think about and I think this was a bad mistake  if you have older parents coming over this will be an issues  Overall  In many ways this is a great remote  I have really come to appreciate the touch screen and the levels of menus accessible with this remote  Although there are some irritations  I still think this is a very nice remote and well worth the purchase to make things more simplistic with the home theater  who needs 5 remotes   With that in mind  I really really like this item  but I don t love it yet based on the quibbles above  This doesn t mean that are better solutions around  because I haven t seen them     Update  After some extensive use and modification  I am really starting to LOVE this item  The ability to make some slight changes without having to hook this up to the computer is terrific  such as modifying icon placements  start positions and similar things  this makes life easier  as well as the overall use  which as I become more used to the functions  becomes far easier  This is a great update and I am hiving some fun with even being able to modify individual icons on the channels  Awesome  The software package makes this incredibly easy to do  unlike the previous iteration which was far tougher 
It takes some time to become familiar with this universal remote and it can be sensitive in its operation  specifically it must be kept pointed toward the devices when operating  Once you have experience with its various functions it becomes very handy 
This TV is a great value  Its easy to set up and has a great picture  The smart feature makes accessing Hulu and Netflix a breeze  A 50 LED 1080p smart TV for under 500  and Samsung is our favorite brand 
VERY easy to hook up  sounds great and for a good price  And more than enough wire to install all speakers  Just need the right receiver for it thats all

Great unit  I have this thing hooked up to a Bose Wave Radio in my shop  Sounds great  everything is easy to navigate  Plus if you buy one now  theres a free listening event through Nov  27th so you get a few weeks to use it before paying anything I like satellite more than streaming  less babysitting and no worries about eating bandwidth

Easy pairing with my phone  Great sound and clarity 
We use this with our phones  IPads and computers  Anything Bluetooth 
This thing is absolutly worthless doesn t control my new samsung tv or my Xbox one s nor the sound bar probably cause it s brand new this year  I m very dissaponted I will use it with my other tv and direct Tv but I won t ever by another Logitech remote I got a urc remote now and it works awesome
very nice product  sounds great  same one BEST BUY 160 00 more  volume all way up still sounds great 
this stereo ROCKS  my hot tub is finally complete 
Greatest stereo ever I recommend great sound and no distortion
Great sound the travels  High  highs and deep bass lows makes this speaker a great buy  Not to mention the flashing lights that nounce to the beat of QGODFEAR com
frankly  after having this 10 days and getting used to it i am utterly amazed  i transferred all my settings into it from my old 650 in minutes  which sure made things a lot quicker  after all these years they were still there  but it is a very good thing i had not forgotten that 7 year old  defunct e mail address  i pressed the Watch TV activity  and my Sony HDTV  Onkyo receiver  Dish Hopper DVR  and Pinnacle subwoofer  i built an IR switch for it   all clicked on  it feels great in your hand and is lighter  and i like the felt like  rough surface of the back  however i can t lay it on the chair arm face down to keep it from slipping off  there aren t enuf buttons to grip it  which ironically is good   and sometimes it will erroneously trigger the touch screen  a very minor problem  but it is less likely to damage itself falling on the carpet since it doesn t weigh much  i d give it 5 stars  but i do not find the favorite channel screen useful  the icons are too small to see well w  o my reading glasses  i d rather just go to my guide grid on the Dish Hopper and select the channels there  where i can see what is actually on  and it is difficult to scroll up and down w  o selecting the wrong channel by mistake  for that matter  that is a problem in selecting functions on the devices too   it takes just the right touch   however  i just love the gesture screen controlled by swipes taps  i wish it had the ability to be controlled by two fingers also  so i had 22 instead of 11 gestures  but the screen is a bit cramped for that  and it requires the hub and a smartphone which is overkill for my purposes   i reprogrammed 4 of the 11  and use the buttons instead   several of which control the input of my PC in the bedroom  making this old Sony HDTV semi smart w   a wireless keyboard and mouse  the adjustable vibration feedback when you complete a command is simply splendid  there are also about 10 different screen backgrounds to choose from  you can even upload a pic when it is plugged into the computer and create one s own wallpaper  backgrounds my major gripe about these Logitech remotes   remotes in general   and i have had two before this one  is the buttons wear out  before the electronics  and they will not sell the keypad  i am a retired electronics technician  so i am capable of prying apart the old 650 and replacing it   a classic example of planned obsolescence   this is part of the reason i went the extra mile and got this and i am happy i did   of course the main button that went bad controlled the Dish  and was one of the four around the little screen that are not mappable  so i could not transfer it to another   this model is tight as a clam  and they claim the rechargeable lithium battery should never need replacing  well  it may last longer than i do  but all batteries eventually need replacing  the little stand that it recharges in  either by micro USB  or AC  DC voltage converter w   micro USB is great  in no time one gets into the habit of putting it back in the stand  so one is less likely to misplace it  and it doesn t take very long to recharge  the 650 ate batteries for breakfast this was refurbished  recertified  and came w   a QC sticker on it  i got it elsewhere  and it looks and functions brand new  Logitech handles it w   a warranty like it is a brand new one  and i don t think i am imagining this  their customer  tech service seems to have improved from what i remember  80  is a bargain  when one considers the retail price of a new one  this was refurbished  recertified  came w   a QC sticker on it  and i obtained it elsewhere  it looks and functions as if brand new  off the shelf  Logitech handles it w   a warranty like it is a brand new one  and i don t think i am imagining this  their customer  tech service seems to have improved from what i remember  80  is a bargain  when one considers the retail price of a new one 
Of all the Harmony remotes that I ve owned over the years  this is by far my least favorite Weaknesses Lack of physical number buttons  This is of course a design choice by Harmony  I just don t like it Lack of IR spread   This remote must be pointed directly at the devices you re trying to controlSlowness   Takes a long time to turn all the devices on  This used to be a configurable setting in the old software Software usability   Compared to the old harmony software  the new version is watered down regarding functionality and lacks usability    intuitiveness Operational issues   I have to hard reset this thing once a week or so because the screen stops turning offStrengths Controls all my IR devicesPrice was good as I got it on saleI ll look elsewhere when it comes time to replace this Harmony remotes I ve owned in the past for various family members    locations  Of all of these  this is the worst Harmony 1   The best by farHarmony Touch   Very similar to the Ultimate in feel but works way better Harmony 700   Solid and affordableHarmony 880   Great remote until the dog got itThere s another silver version that I haven t had to mess with in so long I even forget the model  
This remote works fine and does what it is supposed to do  The only problem that I have had with it is the unfortunate placement of the volume control  If one is not extra careful it is too easy to hit the exit button which is directly above the volume control  When that happens the entire streaming sequence is shut off and one has to start my vet again from the beginning  Perhaps a software solution could be developed which would require a double click on the exit button in order to activate it  Frank Metzger
This remote is very user friendly  We set it up within minutes of receiving it and it has worked perfectly for 3 months 
This remote is THE BEST    It controls my Vizio  my Soundbar  AND my Apple TV  I set up the tasks so it automatically switches inputs on the TV  my volume control is thru my soundbar  all the cable  Verizon  tv functions work great as well  I m really stoked  Get this thing 
I m having trouble turning my Wii game system on  It doesn t say Wii  it says X Box  Then again  I m a dinosaur and it could be me with the problem 
If you have a device that cannot be controlled by this remote  then that device probably cannot be controlled remotely at all  This thing will work everything from a 1980 s VCR  to window A  C units  to WiFi connected LED light bulbs  Oh  and it can also change the channel on your TV  Since it s rechargeable  I never have to dig around in the junk drawer for batteries in the middle of my favorite show ever again This remote has a clean  attractive interface and decent button layout  It may take a little while to get used to  but once you re comfortable with this remote there s no going back  The colorful touch screen and haptic feedback take this remote to a whole new level in your home theater  The programmable activities make it a breeze for things that used to take multiple steps and several different remotes to accomplish Overall I would recommend this remote for it s impressive features  ease of use  and good looks 
This is my second Logitech Harmony  My first remote lasted well over 8 years and never had any issues except the battery would no longer maintain a charge  I was so satisfied with my first one that I decided to buy another  This remote will control almost anything u program in to it  It is very easy to set up and effortless to use  One buton turns on  off everything  The help feature fixes any issue with ease  My only complaint is that the battery life seems a bit short but I do use it quite a bit every day  I will forever continue to use Logitech for my remote needs 
My 2011 MacBook pro was getting slower after new software updates but lately it started taking so much time in opening a new tab in the browser  I was planning to sell it and even put an ad on craiglist  But then I found this RAM  I thought to give it a try and    my mac is working as when it was new  Must buy for upgrading your mac 
This product work great  It s good to have one remote to control multiple device all at the same time so I don t have to switch back and forth between remote 
No matter where you are in your house  office  restaurants  as long as there is Wi Fi  you are connected to the channels you have at home  Watching the World Series at a restaurant while enjoying a great dinner was a wonderful experience 
I am very happy with this product  I would certainly buy it again 
This mount does a great job for our 55 inch tv  It was so simple to mount  is very sturdy and is aesthetically pleasing  Sanus engineered this product the way a product should be engineered 
Had a previous model a year ago and had to return it as could not make it visible over my internet connection  I bought this newer model and could not be happier  Installs easily and the picture quality is great from anywhere with an Internet connection on my phone and tablet 
I bought this for home office use and I fear it is way more machine than needed  It was the best deal for the price so I couldn t pass it up  It is definitely future proofed for a handful of years in my opinion 
A lot of remotes try to be universal but with so many you have to keep the remote for each component handy just in case  With this intuitive product storing individual remotes at hand becomes much less necessary  I have a fairly complicated 4K system with big speakers and all the usual components and only limited tech knowledge myself so I definitely needed the Geek Squad to program it  This is my second one and it s even better than the first that I got with the system just over 2 years ago  Only a 2 year warranty was offered with the first and it gave out just after 2 years so I had to pay for the whole thing plus the installation  I think someone knew something that I didn t when they only offered 2 years  This is my only complaint 
This is the worst remote we have ever had  The buttons don t work  It looks like it has more options  but it very frustrating to use  I m love technology and would not recommend this to anyone
This is the worst remote control I ve ever owned  You re better off getting up and changing the channels manually then buingy this piece of junk 
This is the worst Harmony I ve ever used  It s an ergonomic disaster with little that is done right  It is however still a Harmony  so it somehow salvages 3 stars for what they all do right It seemed nice in the box  and it was a breeze transferring everything from my Harmony 700 to this via the My Harmony program  The weight and balance are good and the charging cradle works well  Everything else ranges from bad to worse Maybe one day the screen  pad will do what I need it to do  but for now it s rubbish and it s in the location where the most used buttons should be  As a result those buttons are below  4 way controller  volume  channel  etc    or above  play  pause  etc      Ugh  Worse yet the screen  pad isn t just dead space  honestly it would be better if it were   rather it s live  That can be ok when it s acting like a touch pad with various taps and swipes to do things  it never works that well  but I see what they re trying to do   but it s a disaster when it s live with functions that are so seldom used there s no dedicated button  So channel favorites  random superfluous functions  etc get accidentally pressed  Even then they hardly work in the case of the favorites with my Motorola cable box running Uverse  95 of the time 2 or 3 of the 4 digits are recognized   When you avoid that pad the other buttons are cramped and arranged poorly even within their poor locations  The 4 way pad is small  as are the play and pause buttons and the skip and fast forward buttons are shared  Of all the sacrifices made for the screen  pad  those red  green  yellow  and blue buttons you never use are still there  UGH     Move the screen up  move the key buttons where the fingers land  kill the color keyed buttons that don t ever do s***  and try again  Oh and the battery life sucks too  Please make a new flagship controller ala the Harmony One  original  880  etc    Hell the 700s I have are better than this The Harmony software and ecosystem is still strong  and as noted before  there s a lot this gets right  but so does every other Harmony and they lack this ergonomic disaster 
Hint   this is the second one that I bought and the first one is working fine 
Crystal clear picture and my mother in law says it is perfect  It s got great volume  as I can hear it downstairs haha I think this is a great TV and for the price   you can t go wrong  All TVs in the house are now Samsung  
I tried two other Harmony remotes first  the elite and the ultimate home  This is the one that was the best for me 
This is now my third Ultimate One  the previous ones both had problems with the battery failing after 15  18 months  refuses to take a charge   Hopefully this one lasts a bit longer  if there was an alternative to this remote I would try it but nothing competes with the Ultimat in terms of features 
This so called slim mount does not allow shifting left  right unless fully extended    defeating the purpose of a slim mount in most installations  If you slide the TV on the mounting bar  the bar will tilt or bend and the TV will be tilted toward the heavier side of the bar  This contradicts the information advertised on their webpage  although they have clarified the description somewhat here on amazon  The only way to shift it is to fully extend it from the wall  then the wall arms themselves can shift a few inches on the wall plate  If you are able to install the mount centered between two studs  then perhaps you have no need to shift the TV while in the slim position  My studs were only 3 off center of my wall  yet my TV is lopsided when I move it a few inches to the center  From everything Sanus described about this mount at the time  I understood the TV could be shifted while in any position  Not even close  I need the TV to be close to the wall due to some near side seating  Because of this mount s limitations  we can t view the TV from those sides  the Mount os too far from the wall  and have the TV centered at the same time  I could have purchased a much less expensive slim mount that would have had less limitations than this one  This mount did not fit the bill 
Make sure you aren t prone to epileptic seizures due to flashing lights  It does have the option to turn it off though  Same with bass boost  This speaker is nice  loud  and crisp  The app associated with it is easy to use as well  The only problem we ran into is connecting multiple speakers together in the party mode  Had to google additional instructions from the ones provided  but learned that both systems have to be connected by bluetooth  Bought two  ended up returning the other because of this 
I got this for my cousin who loves to bake  Red is her color in the kitchen  
We selected this radio because we just leased a 2018 auto without SiriusXM and we wanted that feature  This radio was installed by Geek Squad without cutting a hole in our new car and it looks like a factory addition 
I have always used Corsair products and this was a great price 
I own a Surface Pro 4  I bought a black keyboard with the computer  I am very pleased with the keyboard  It is solid and functional  But  this grey two tone Signature keyboard   which functions exactly the same as the one I have   has a nice tactile feel and the color complements the Surface 4  3  The Signature gives the Surface Pro 3  4 the beautiful all grey look of a Surface Book  or  ahem  a Mac   We re talking personal taste here  for sure  But  if design and style would add pleasure to using your Surface Pro 3  4  you have to take a close look at the Signature   The other Surface keyboard colors are cool  too  
This is a very handy remote programed all six other remotes that I was using for home theater into this one 
When you get used to this sleekly designed remote control  you ll find out that it s a terrific gadget  It s not very difficult to set up all your devices and activities  I like the touchscreen  You can scroll through all your favorites in less than 2 seconds and choose which TV channel you want to watch This remote control doesn t consume too much energy  Therefore  there is no need to leave it on its charger permanently      Five stars    
This is a terrible remote  Everthing is in the screen including the numbers for turning to different channel  You have to go to two screens to get to the number to just change the channel 
I did not get the Surface Pro 4 because my Surface Pro 3 has been treating me very well  I decide to however get the new pen and this keyboard First  the Windows Hello feature works flawlessly Second  the typing experience is completely different so much so that I wonder why Microsoft did not start from here I recommend you get this keyboard  it will change your typing experience on the Surface line of products 
I enjoy listening to talk radio  Sirius is perfect 
I love the way MS Surface uses a magnetic connection point for its keyboard  I also am extremely glad I purchased the one with the fingerprint login  It makes logging in a snap  AND  the keyboard doubles as a tablet cover 
This thing is a ready and handy fellow just in case you are searching where is your remote  Well  this one hold 15 of them 
This is a great stereo with really good bass and it does not distort at all at full volume  which you can hear down the street when it is all the way up  I strongly recommend this as the best system in its class coming from a non Sony guy 
This is a great remote  I especially like the programmable gesture controls which are intuitive and convenient  The other major improvement over previous Logitech TS remotes is the ability to load your cable providers channel list and select your favorite channels from the list   complete with channel icons Simple and quick to program and a pleasure to use 
This is a great remote to get if you want to eliminate the clutter and steps of using multiple remotes 
I bought this for my daughter she loves it she can listen to her music and it s comfortable to wear
This is a great computer  It is fast and efficient  Exactly what I was looking for
I purchased this for a friend who was always having to plug his phone in and feeling embarrassed about it  He is also style conscious  Now instead of being embarrassed  he shows off his new �toy�  I feel good that I went 1st class and that he appreciated it  You can t go wrong on this one 
I ve been using this remote for about a year now  before that had a harmony one  which I miss  but we finally sat on it too many times and it broke The good I can use it to control my Apple TV  Tivo HD  Bluray player and receiver with ease  All the needed buttons seem to be there for with some left over for extra stuff  I ve got the 30 sec skip forward and back programmed on the bottom buttons  as well as the Live TV button and cancel button for Tivo You can setup your favorite channels as icons on the fly and sync them back to your computer The help feature always seems to work for me when things mess up  The Harmony one often took several steps to correct the power if the TV went to sleep Recharging dock is nice It actually replaces all my other remotes The disappointing I miss having a hard number buttons  The screen is a poor replacement  You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard The screen doesn t wake up when you move the remove like the Harmony One did  The touchscreen is too slow and doesn t feel responsive compared to a smartphone The gestures are completely useless for controls You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard The setup software was a pain in the ass to get going  It used silver lite or some plugin in a browser  It would have been better as a native app  The software menus were confusing and some features seems exclusive when they shouldn t have been  I couldn t program a tivo button and something else  I had to get the tivo remote and program it as a custom button The button signals are also too slow  I was able to shorten them in the software program  but only for favorite channel buttons  Turning things off from my TV mode takes 15 seconds or so  doesn t sound like much but feels like forever pointing it at the screen While I could change speed of the favorite buttons punching in the numbers  I couldn t get it fast enough  I think the min time between presses was 200ms or something  I feel like I can punch in the numbers faster on my Tivo remote  if I wanted too  I should be able to make this faster but I couldn t in the software Overall  if you have the money  get the Harmony remote with the hardware buttons  it cost 2X what this one does   This gets the job done  but leaves me feeling disappointed 
This did the job quite well  I usually need the closed Cabinet feature  and I paired this product with a Home Hum and everything works seamlessly 
My goal in a new desktop was it has to be as fast as possible  quiet as possible  decent non internal graphics  I m not a gamer  that could be upgraded later  and be easy to maintain should the need arise  After scouring the web and local stores  this PC seemed to fit all my requirements better than any other in a similar price range  Bottom line  this PC exceeded my expectations  It is so quiet I do not even know it is turned on  I usually build my own PCs and this is the first time in 30  years that I have finally selected an off the shelf PC  Am I ever glad I did  The internal engineering is a marvel to behold If looking for a great desktop replacement  this is the one 
This is one of the best remotes I have ever owned  It holds over 8 devices and once you set it up there are nothing to worry about  
This maybe thin but is just as easy to use as a regular keyboard
The 700s sound very great  I like the noise cancellation  along with the ambient aware for when someone wants to talk  they are a bit pricey  but worth the money if you like clean clear music 
They shipped quickly  goods packaging is also very fine  This works so much better than I thought it would  You can t do better for the price if you want an economical and cost items will never miss it  arrived before expected  love them everyone needs these best buy for the dollar Its price is pretty reasonable among the store I have viewed  Great quality and delivered on time 
I ve been using Harmony Remote for years  The Ultimate One is my latest upgrade as my 888 died  I am now using 3 of these This series is by far the easiest to program and update  The online software talks you through setup  you just have to know your equipment and what inputs you re using  Setup should take no more then 20 30 minutes 
I ve been using Harmony remotes for years and love them This series may be the easiest to program yet  Took less than a half hour to get it all up and running Features are easy to access and use Simply a pleasure to useThe only change I would like to see is online being able to name each remote in the account instead of having to use a number  I have 3 and it would make changes easier if I could pick the remote from the menu by name
These tapes work as they should  They hold a decent amount of footage and it s clear video  Video tape is on the old side of the technology curve  but that s the camera we bought and at least we can still get them  Glad Best Buy had them 
I had the only for a month and the right ear short circuted
So I ended up going to the windows store to buy it  I have not used it as much as I thought I would since windows hello works well but I wanted my wife to be able to access my surface easily 
The bass response is no well at all   You have to keep the radio at low volumes to get a halfway decent bass sound  If you raise the volume past 12 horrible 
They have a very long battery life  I use them everyday and haven t had to recharge them  Sometimes  though  the sound drops and I don t know why since they get good reception through my car  through walls in my apartment and from pretty far away  but when my phone is in my pocket  the sound drops out  until I place my phone near the headphones  Another thing is that I bought these to work out with  but they aren t very secure on my head  but i guess it s better a little unsecured than hella tight on my head  so I exercise mindful that they can fall off  Other than that  they are pretty good 
The Bluetooth works with a laptop but not a phone 
love them keeps noise out while listening to music
Good sounding speakers for a good price  I have them in the doors
Our recent car purchase had  blown  speakers in the front and we put in this pair of JBL speakers to replace them  It did far more that replace them because the quality of sound far exceeds the factory speakers  The installer was prompt and did a great job  I would recommend these to anyone seeking to increase the sound quality in their auto particularly in the bass range 
I bought a pair of these speakers  The wireless and Bluetooth options are great  Bottom line is they were very expensive and they sound OK but I expected them to sound much better for the price tag of retail  299  each 
They are much more user friendly and comfortable than the last set from the same company 
These are so worth the money  2 kids and love them
I ve owned more than a dozen Bluetooth headphones over the last 2 3 years  most end up returned or quickly retired to a shelf  The Everest Elite 700 will not suffer either of these fates  it is exactly what I have been looking for Bluetooth  adjustable noise canceling  great sound and comfortable fit  it s all there  I use mine with my home theater  a Bluetooth transmitter attached to the headphone output of the AV receiver  and headphones paired with that  Music  4k movies  sports  all are represented well by the sound of these headphones  Good but not overpowering bass and no perceptible loss of mid and high tones  I highly recommend them 
Great  These are the tapes my camera takes and they work great every time 
I caught these on sell  but I prefer these tapes anyway  They work great and are reusable  
I read reviews prior to purchasing these for  249 99 at Best Buy and downloaded the JBL application which helps tremendously  The ear cushions surround my ears at a perfect fit and the sound is great in my opinion  I had some Beats but those required a battery at all times which was a bummer for me  If you didn t have a battery for the Beats headphones you were not able to listen to them at all  These have a rechargeable battery so as long as you keep them charged they ll be good to go  Thanks
These Tapes are hard to find but was glad Best Buy had them  They are much more expensive than I remembered but was happy to pay it because I needed the tapes 
These are GREAT speakers  I replaced all four door speakers in my 2007 Silverado Crew Cab and it sounds amazing  I added a 10 inch subwoofer for some bass because despite what anyone says  6 1  2 speakers are NOT for bass  They DO  however  play crystal clear mids and highs without any distortion at nearly full volume  so loud it hurts  I am going to buy some to replace the speakers in my wife s car next  Go ahead and buy some for yourself  you won t be disappointed 
These are the second set of these speakers  We bought the first paid and they sound great and are loud so we got another set for the other side of the yard 
These headphones are literally the best thing I ve ever put on my skull  I absolutely love them  because every feature works flawlessly  ANC is VERY close to the level of Bose QuietComfort  and the awareness feature is extremely useful in an office setting or when you need to be alert  Sound quality is spot on  and I prefer the sound balance over any other headphone offered at BestBuy  I read a lot of reviews comparing these to the most expensive Beats or Bose  but I don t understand how the others even stand up to these  These sound MUCH better and are more comfortable than any pair of Beats  which are too punchy and hurt my ears physically and audibly   The JBL s also sport many more features than any pair of Bose  which mainly competitive comfort and their top notch ANC  These headphones are really in their own class  because they are PACKED with features  have excellent sound quality  especially with a little tweaking using the app  and they look classy unlike other overpriced  Transformer esque  headphones  Below are the reasons why I bought these  Stable Bluetooth Active Noise Cancellation Adjustable awareness TruNote calibration Handsome design Extreme battery life Foldable Has its own app for mobile  which malfunctions occasionally on my 3 year old phone but works fine on a newer one  Are soooo comfortable  I can wear them for hours  and I have very sensitive ears  The ear pads can be replaced if they wear out  which ensures a long life of use  This is a MUST for expensive headies These headphones are pricey  but the price is reflective of their awesomeness  Totally worth it to me I got rid of all my old over ears and on ears to get these  because these do everything and more of what my other headphones did 
OK  I stole the review title from the infamous Highlander movie  but I did so because it does apply  The Harmony One  in world of universal remotes  really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes  but does so at a seemingly steep price  and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another Logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online Logitech profile This is my third Logitech remote   I am upgrading from an older model  the 650  The programming software I was using to update my 650 is no longer used by Logitech  nor does it even recognize the Ultimate One  So  despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote  the remote could not connect to the Logitech website  I wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via Google that the One is not compatible with the old software  It would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructions I was less than thrilled when I learned I would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the Logitech website with my existing information  Once I did  thankfully it asked if I had an existing account and once I entered my old information  it allowed me to port over all my existing devices  So  I got to where I needed to be but it took longer than it should have Those of you who have Logitech remotes know that you enter your devices  TV model  DVD player  Home Theater Receiver model  etc  and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie  playing a game  etc   and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function   e g   which device controls sound and volume  etc   Once this is all programmed  you update the remote  which is connected to your computer  and off you go  Once this data is entered and configured  the One really shines  It lights up when you pick it up  You can control all your devices of course with just the one remote  You can even stagger power on or off order if you want  It will set your TV and other devices to the correct inputs if they need to be changed between functions I use an Xbox One to watch my Blu Rays and DVD s  The Xbox controller is a poor TV remote  We like subtitles on when we watch DVD s  I was able to set up a quick one button macro in the Logitech software that walks through the four button presses required on the Xbox One to enable subtitles with a single button press on the Ultimate One  The software allows a high degree of customization that I really appreciate Of course  this programming ability is part of what drives the high cost of the product  This isn t just a remote  It is really a software driven input device with a touch screen   I use a combination of the touch screen and my buttons depending on my mood   It lights up when you pick it up  feels good in your hands  and in a feature I really like   it has its own charging cradle  Past versions really ate up batteries  I like returning it to its charging cradle after use because I know where it is when I need it again  and it saves me the cost of replacing batteries As others have noted  not everyone would consider spending 250 on a remote  Even if you are willing to spend the money  you still need some basic technological prowess to program and fine tune this remote to make it work for you  If you have relatives that still struggle with basic computer tasks or how to program their DVR to record their favorite shows  this is not a product for them  I have family members who could not ever hope to program this remote  It is not a complex task to do so  but for people who struggle with technology  programming this remote could be a formidable task I have a fairly simple home theater line up with no line of sight issues  so I can t address using this with a hub  But  if you are sick of juggling remotes on movie night  or want to upgrade an existing Logitech  the One is a great step forward 
Their Software does not run on Apple OSX 10 9  or even 10 10    had to return it  since I could not program it 
I really liked the wall mount with the exception of the profile not being smaller  or the cord management attachment was too flimsy  the cords are so heavy they plastic gatherer was bowing at the middle 
I m giving it 3 stars as it wouldn t connect with my phone  galaxy S3  be aware it only works with some bluetooth systems  I wish I would have known this  The unit sounds great and my buddy could connect to it with his iPhone 
Are they there yet Nope  Still a pretty big a bite to setup  that has not changed much since I first started using the Harmony One eight or nine years ago and still use it  That model  I have no idea why it still works  It has been dropped  stepped on  kicked across the floor  my dog chewed on it  and it has came apart at the seams  I snap and bend it back into place and it still works  That is just amazing to me  Now to the remote at hand  Harmony Ultimate One IR Ok what that means is that this is the version that does not have the remote hub that allows you to use the radio frequency to control tech in the next room  though walls  or in cabinets  You can get the remote hub separately here on Amazon  and I will be getting that because I am so tired at looking at all the receivers  players  and crap  I just can t stand it any longer  I want a clean look  Invisible tech The Harmony Ultimate can control up to 15 devices  and Logitech has a library of nearly a quarter million different home entertainment products and their respective infrared commands  Even if your HDTV or Blu ray player is obscure  you ll probably be able to control it with this remote The downside on the buttons is that it has nothing to do with previous versions of Harmony Remotes so now you have to relearn the pattern you were used to  If you are first time Harmony customer no big deal  The only thing I have heard if you get the hub and I have personally not experienced this is that the hub may need to be reset from time to time You control all your devices with one remote now and be able to make totally customizable control layouts and multi device macros  then this Harmony One Ultimate will bend to your will  You just need a bit of patience and determination  plus a touch of imagination to turn this remote into anything you need a remote to be  It may take you some time to sit down and put all the entries in  Heck this thing can even control lighting and window blinds if thats your thing In the end  I love touch screens  It makes everything so much more like your phone  And if you get the hub you can control your tech programed into the Harmony Ultimate from your phone with the downloadable app Pain in the butt to program  great user experience if you have the patience and tenacity to put in what you need to control  Is that easy NO  If you have trouble doing technical things let your kid do it for you  Or find a twelve year old and bet them ten bucks they can t program it Mission accomplished  If you have read these reviews on Amazon look into the negative reviews and you will most likely see that a logitech representative is reaching out to the reviewer to help them with a direct email or phone link  I like to see this from companiesUPDATE 6  10  14  I find the right Chanel toggle and left volume toggle too low on the remote for comfortable use  The remote is already shorter than the Harmony One  so that part is not ergonomic at all  Remote should be longer or they should have moved the toggles higher on remote 
The TV worked fine on day one  On day 2 the over the air tuner started to fail  The right side edge of the screen was distorted on every channel  The vendor denied the return since I they away the box  I offered to buy a new one  pay for the front  and return the defective one in new box  He rejected that deer because the new box would not match the serial number of the defective unit 
Use this tape if you have a miniDV camcorder  Still gives you the best video and sound of all the current formats out there  except for the HD camcorders 
i would highly recommend installing stereos and speakers with best buy
I actually returned it   I couldn t get it to work  
The first thing I notice is the sound quality is FAR WORSE than my old VIZIO  Sounds equivalent to a cheap alarm clock radio to me  I will also comment on how unstable this TV is on the legs  installed correctly for sure  they provide  It would have been so easy for them to include a stable swivel center stand as the TV is very light  Are they looking to upsell a better stand Very disappointing  I will add more to this review as I use it more 
I would suggest buying this product  The price is great for the quality of the system 
I was hoping it would have a decent sound  but it was so bad that I had to keep the volume low  It was a cheap speaker  as far as speakers go   so I didn t have high expectations  Just thought I d take it for a test run  knowing I could return it if I didn t like it  I returned the speaker 
The battery life is good the sound is great I hear clear on the phone
Best Buys has the best prices anywhere  I check around but seem to always buy here
These headphones replace  on ear  Sony headphones which were great  I love the comfort and sound my JBLs deliver  Still exploring the Bluetooth aspects and programming selections  Was a little turned off by the download reviews and did not opt in to that  So far  so good  Excellent product 
I owned the P5 headphones and was extremely happy with them However  the depth of bass  full rich sound and over the ear stylemakes the P7 a must for true audiophiles 
The software to configure the remote works great  it s an improvement over the old app I used with my previous Harmony One The battery life is too short compared to the Harmony One  I have to put it back in the charger about every third day The transport controls are located at the very top and require a second hand to operate 
I have a 93 honda civic   and they sound amazing    the bass is loud and clear   
This 2x4 SoDIMM DDR3 memory kit by Corsair has proven to be a good buy  it has noticeably sped up operations on the computer  and we could not be happier about that  We tried other brands  and they caused either the BSoD  Blue Screen of Death  or did not let the computer even boot up at all  We can thank our local Geek Squad Agent for this recommendation  This Corsair DDR3 RAM was the right memory 
I�ve been using these drives for several years with my Synology NAS Backup Server  They are super stable and the Synology support team is nothing short of amazing  I hope Best Buy continues to stock these products 
The remote works well  To replace a device can be frustrating  If you do reset the remote settings and start over  you will save yourself time 
the remote will change channels  change devices or change from my dvr when i pickup the controller  the unit is very sensitive  other than that it does everything as advertised sometimes when you don t want to
This is my third Remote control purchase from Best Buy  It s very easy to set up and use  The remote fits in your hand very well  The button layout is simple and functional  My only complaint is the battery life of the charge  In a week without heavy use the remote will need a charge again This is truly the remote control that will make your life easier  As mentioned before this is my third purchase living room bedroom and man cave 
The remote is good  but who design the software of this product is really stupid  The software always told me a communication error  and backed to login page again and again  My OS is Win 8 1 The software can t auto login even I ticked remember me  but it always asks me to type in password Only shows HDMI1 when I setup watch TV  but I have my TV s HDMI2 connected to TV box  there is a instruction tell me I can add more input  I follow up that instruction to Device setup page  but I couldn t find out where to change input
This remote gets the job done but I hey sensitive  The only thing is that the screen times out too quickly and it doesn t work well through cabinets 
The anarchy 8 gb two piece is Amazing  if you feel that you may not have enough RAM  for Around  85  depending on sale price  you can buy more than you could reasonable need  after having upgraded almost every aspect of my computer  one of the biggest overall speed boosts was this very over the top RAM stick combo 
I ve been looking for high quality bluetooth headphones for over a year now  I walked into Bestbuy assuming I would buy the Bose Quietcomfort but walked out with the JBL 700 Elites  Great sound  and very adjustable using the JBL iOS app   wonderful build quality and very comfortable to wear  The fit is a bit snug  but I ve got a large head 
You get the quality of Beats headphones for a cheaper price with the added functions of wireless and noise cancellation 
In a world of Beats and Bose  Bowers and Wilkins offers more to its customers the all the other competitors  The sound quality is amazing and this is coming from a person the has had many other headphones before this unit we are talking about today  Build quality is that of a Rangefinder offering only metal and leather with no plastic to see in site  The sound is in a word balanced an unique  I love these cans and they will last me for years to come 
Enjoying it quite a  The perfect size for my stand 
Having owned one of each of the last four generations of Logitech Harmony remotes  I should be immediately called out as a homer on the brand and concept  and I am  But I ve had quibbles with all of them over time  and I ll go over some of those quibbles   and why they ve been eliminated from the nearly perfect Harmony Ultimate One The first quibble was size and feel  It was difficult to reach buttons on larger versions of the harmony without swinging it two handed like a broadsword  This version is easy to manipulate  from top to bottom The second was the touchscreen  With old Harmony remotes the odds you could get through a TV session without accidentally brushing the touchscreen and landing  inevitably  on channel 1 were next to nil  This one does an excellent job of disregarding inadvertent contact with the screen  In addition  the screen is much more useful  with swipe motions to go between the four major functions  touchpad  number pad  function screen and channel screen  The third was the setup  This is the main selling point for the Harmony  the ability to make all your devices function with one touch for an activity  Previously  this required a lot of manual finesse  One example  my receiver needs about 5 seconds after turning on to boot and receive additional commands  With the old remotes  I had to manually program in the delay  With the Ultimate One  the delay is accounted for  I can t imagine how much product testing and research by the logitech team went into the presets that accompany each device you add  but I haven t had to customize the remote s interaction with *anything * It just works 
Best buy is the only place where i buy my electronics
This remote does it all and even corrects my mistakes  The help button really works  and I no longer need 4 or 5 remotes  It would seem to be a bit tricky to program  and the Geek Squad did it for be with ease  no fuss and for that I am most gratefull 
The harmony remote does control all of my devices  It s a bit sluggish on the remote interface but all in all it does what you need it do  If you want to stop using all your remotes do yourself a favor   pick one up 
This is another testament to the customer service of Sanus  After reading their reviews  I decided to spend the extra money for a quality product  Upon installation  I found the mount to be slightly defective  I called the customer service department to trouble shoot it  They first pointed out that I bought the product through a third person party on Amazon which you never know if they have refurbished it or whatever   After that  they quickly identified that the defective part could not be fixed through some replacement part  Their solution they sent me a whole brand new one  The conversation with customer service was with a guy not a computer  in Minnesota not a third world country  and took five minutes from hello to goodbye  The new mount arrived in three days  The new mount was defect free and a great product  They told me they didn t even need to return the old mount and to keep the old mount for spare parts  Not sure how anyone could ask any better service Thanks Sanus
Ive heard quite a few Bluetooth speakers  Some better than others  but one thing they all lacked was good Bass output  Well that has been more than solved here  But its not just about Bass here  The overall sound quality is outstanding  And while were talking about how great it is how about full Alexa control built in as well? YUP    that too  Connectivity to Pandora  iHeart  Spotify  another others as well ensure you will get plenty of choices when it comes to music  In the box is the of course the BT speaker  power adapter  USB cable  quick start guide  and in my case I got the charging dock as well for free  Im not sure but this might be a Best Buy thing  The speaker itself is a nice graphite color that should match most home entertainment set ups  There is also a Blue one if you want something a little more blingier  probably not a word  but you get what I mean   It weighs almost 3 pounds which I assume is because the speaker has some decent drivers to get that the incredible Bass it puts out  Set up is fairly easy  Just download the Ultimate ears app from your devices app store  log into your Amazon account  turn speaker on and follow the instructions to get the speaker and Alexa features all set up  You can also use manual set up via long pressing the power button for pairing to your chosen device  As stated before one of the coolest features this has over some other BT speakers is voice control  So in addition to a Bass rocking speaker you can use it for all sorts off voice commands  Weather updates  play   pause music  etc  And to top all of this off it is IP67 Waterproof for up to 30 minutes in 3  of water  Accidentally drop it in your tub while having a relaxing bath  kicked into your pool while playing poolside  No problem  The initial charge can take up to 3 hours and is rated for up to 16 hours  So a full day should be no problem at all  And if you have the dock as well just keep it on the dock and never have to worry about charging it  All day music with Alexa their anytime you need it  This is by far the best sounding  and most feature rich Bluetooth speaker I have ever heard  And will be recommending it to anyone looking for a nice gift this Holiday season  The name �Ultimate� is definitely deserved here   It is the Ultimate Bluetooth Wi Fi speaker for sure 
The most infuriating remote I ve ever used  The button layout is an ergonomic nightmare  The weight distribution is so uneven  it falls constantly   off a table  off an armchair  out of your hand  The back is so over contoured and slick that you have to place it face down to stay on anything but a completely flat surface  but then you risk triggering the absurdly sensitive touch screen  Oh  the touch screen     Be careful not to breathe on the damn thing or you ll be restarting your system or changing functions constantly and without warning  Did I mention that the battery life is godawful and you must charge it   no removable battery option  Avoid at all costs 
After having a room full of remotes  I was excited to set up and try the Harmony Remote  The instructions were simple to follow  The screen is clear and easy to read  It does take a bit of time to get used to  in relation to turning the systems on and off and where to go within the screen  I really like the fact you can integrate multiple systems  especially in an era where we have so many systems in one area  games  cable  dvd  tv etc   The one downfall for me is that it s another cable with another charger  I already have a computer  bluetooth and phone charging and now I have to keep the charging station out for the remote  This may not be a big tradeoff for some  but I found it a bit annoying 
The layout of the controls seems a bit awkward  The fast forward  play  rewind controls seem difficult to find and use when only using one hand to operate the remote  I often hit the wrong key  e g  pause instead of play record instead of rewind 
The fingerprint works perfect  set up is so easy  I had a surface without a key board it was difficult typing whole page world document as in number of occasion I had to minimize the keyboard  With this one and its flexibility in positioning  everything works perfect 
It is expensive and sensitive and can be slow and if you touch it in the wrong place it can get you lostAny thing effects it if it is dropped or passed to someone and touched it can mess up mute and it is slow
This particular remote has some issues with the ring like button that acts as arrows around the OK button   it tends to stick and isn t always responsive The ideas behind the harmony system are great  but could be executed better  The whole harmony system is actually pretty complex to set up  That said  once it s set up  it works great for an entertainment setup  But the system also has some weaknesses  particularly when it comes to non entertainment devices which might not always make sense as a part of an activity  for example  I have an IR controlled space heater   As IoT devices become more common  I d like to see the Harmony system evolve to be more flexible with respect to activities and non entertainment devices 
I waited about 3 days to get my hands on a pair and believe me the wait was well worth it  I had been debating whether to go with AKG but after listening to these there was absolutely no contest  Money will spent  I feel it should have come with a better case though 
The help button has been moved to a sub menu that requires two or three clicks to access  Also  the page up  down button was removed and is now shared with the channel up  down button  which causes me to change channels inadvertently when scrolling through menus on my cable box 
Great keyboard  nicely spaced keys  good feel and sound when typing  trackpad works way better than older versions  and the fingerprint scanner makes it very easy to login with just a touch

I did not realize that the Surface uses the camera as a means of identification to log in  otherwise I wouldn t have gotten the keyboard with the fingerprint ID  However  there have been several times where the camera has taken a moment or two to figure out what s going on  or didn t turn on for some reason  so I was able to get logged into the Surface quickly by utilizing the Fingerprint ID  Every time that I ve used it  it has worked quickly and easily 
These are fantastic speakers  Treble clarity is phenomenal and the bass sounds great  No need for a subwoofer  I can hear every instrument perfectly  Great speakers at a great price  Geek Squad did a superb installation job too 
This unit is total integration of your iPhone 5 or 6 and your car stereo  Here is what I love about this simple radio  1  In the brightest sunlight and wearing polarized sunglasses you can see it clearly  2  You may listen seamlessly to Apple Music  Apple Radio  e g   Beats 1  or your music from the Cloud or on your phone  3  Siri integration  The simple touch of the button brings up the double chime  You can ask anything   directions to the nearest gas station  start playing music from the Carpenters  etc  4  Integration with Apple Maps so that you can easily navigate with audio directions  Without your phone  this unit is only an AM and FM radio  If you happen to have XM or Sirius on your phone  or for that matter Spotify or Pandora  this will play through the unit  Oh   and your phone charges through the lightening connector while you drive  No Bluetooth  although this may come soon  but honestly music sounds and streams better over the tethered lightning connector  This unit is superb and I cannot compliment Best Buy technicians enough on how they install this unit in your vehicle and integrate it seamlessly into its interior  Love at first sight and first listening   and now the love is deepening 
Man  do these make one heck of a first impression  Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new  genuine leather  From the thick headband to the ear cups  this baby is soft  premium leather all the way  The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they re not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them  Here s my first comparison to it s peers  Most every other set  even over  300 is almost completely plastic  This is solid metal and leather through and through  That s already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag  It s obviously a higher quality product with better materials  I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached  Should there be an unrepairable break or tear  just buy a new set and pop them on  Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches  This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in  You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design  The picture doesn t do these justice  They impress from top to bottom  One thing they don t look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms  sweltering heat and storm season outdoors  They re also much more comfortable than they look  The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they re very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded  I also like the added thickness on top  While they did feel a little clampy when I first put them on  I never felt any real discomfort during my hours of wearing them  They also seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise  They re easily the best noise isolating headphones I ve ever put on  They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case  making them more portable  The ear cups don t swivel though I ll be honest here about the sound  I have to say  I was a little disappointed at first  I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X s  they didn t blow them away  which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation  I then realized that it wasn t a realistic expectation because my M50X s are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage  I thought the P7 s would outperform them so well that I d just ditch them completely  Well  that didn t happen  In fact  I m now convinced that it s probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these  If you have a good set already that s at least over  100 to  200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser  V Moda  Beyerdynamic  Bose  Audio Technica  etc   intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats   the P7 s won t completely redefine good sound for you  At least they didn t for me  Once I got over that  I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have  My M50X s are just a slight notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them  These are a different flavor altogether  The mids and lows are much more pronounced  pushing vocals to the forefront  Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music  Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention  Cello s  harp s and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me  Bass kicked electronic music  Daft Punk  Deadmau5  up a few notches over my AT s as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious  I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I m not a bass head so I don t want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either  It sounds like it s right on the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there  I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT s can do very well  A few bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7 s which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches  I prefer a V shaped sound  favoring the treble and bass  In fact  I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ s  so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums  I also couldn t distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars  The push to the mids made the sound fuller but muddied the separation a little more  For most everything  The P7 s did everything better and outperformed my M50X s  They just came up a little short a few times according to my tastes Outside of music  the P7 s also worked great with T V  shows and movies  Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience  The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad and iPod  The cord even feels better in comparison to others I ve felt  My one drawback is the included case  While it s nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones  I m not a fan of soft cases  Especially not for expensive electronics  It ll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you re going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently  I d have my reservations  I m ordering a hard case for just such uses  These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls  drops  getting sat on or being crushed by other bags  The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife s make up bags which is a bit of a turn off  That s a very minor gripe though In conclusion  these are premium  luxury headphones  The look like it  feel like it  smell like it and sound like it  If you use or have already invested in a decent set of headphones  they won t completely redefine portable listening for you but they ll provide you with a quality product that s head and shoulders above everything else I ve seen on the store shelves  I probably would ve had some buyers remorse had I paid the original  400 asking price for these but at  280 on Cyber Monday  it would take a lot to convince me that there s a better made and sounding headphone than the B W P7  This is one of those rare times where getting what you pay for turns out to be a good thing  Highly recommended for music listeners and those who appreciate a little luxury every now and then *Note  After Cyber Monday  the P7 s went up to  350 which looks like their new standard asking price  That still seems like a pretty good deal and keeps them at the top of the heap in that price range 
This receiver can not be beat for the cost of it and plus the features that it has built into it  This thing is so great that i will be buying two more one for my other car and my moms car as well  The blue tooth pairing is instant and works without a flaw  the sound is great and its a breeze setting this thing up  The only missing option will be the compact disc player which i think is not much of use today anyways 
Installed in 97 Harley  The Bluetooth connects and works great with my iPhone  Volume level is good for 2 lane hwy and around town  Could stand a bit more wattage to overcome interstate wind noise  70mph and up   Overall  a great radio for the price 
This keyboard is awsome  I find it very easy to type on  and prefer it to my pc s keyboard  If anything happens to this keyboard  I will buy another one  without thinking about it  The best 
The easiest to set up and use  Having 5 phones that are exactly alike makes life easy  No searching for the flash or redial buttons  They hold there charge for a long time and recharge quickly 
This is the Best gift ever   Everything all at the touch of a screen  
After shopping around a long time I couldn t find any headset that had all of the main factors I needed in a headset until I found the B   W P7  The build quality is solid  The sound is amazing  The fit over the ears is great and blocks out all ambient noise  The case is not what I would expect but it does the job  The fit over the head is a bit tight so it can be a bit uncomfortable at times  If you try these out  nothing else will satisfy you so don t even try them unless you plan to buy them 
PROS  Waterproof design Easy setup Great battery life Great sound qualityCONS  Price No hands free SpotifySUMMARY  If you�re looking for a great sounding battery powered water resistant Alexa enabled speaker and don�t mind the cost or lack of full Spotify support this is the speaker you have been looking for REVIEW There is a lot to love about this speaker   the straight forward styling  the easy discovery and setup  and great quality audio  The Megablast is essentially an upgraded version of the Megaboom and it gets even better with the addition of Alexa support  Setup is dead simple  You download the Ultimate Ears app and launch it and it will automatically discover the speaker if it�s already turned on  It will ask for your wifi information and then your Amazon account to setup Alexa if you like  It s dead simple  You can still skip this if you would prefer to use just Bluetooth  It will also check for updates  so the speaker software can improve over time  Hopefully this means we will see support for more music services The design is what I have come to expect from the UE line  It has the same woven cloth mesh all the way around with large rubber volume buttons  It�s waterproof so you can take this to the beach or let it float in the bathtub at home The audio quality is top notch  Sound is clear with punch bass that is impressive in a portable speaker  It s just an all around solid sounding speaker  The voice control for music works great especially if you are an Amazon Prime Music user  If you are a Spotify user unfortunately there is not full support  so you won t be using your voice to play any tracks from the service  Since this is just like any Echo device you can control any smart home devices  set timers  as for the weather  etc  The Megablast�s microphone�s are sensitive enough to pick up my voice  but if the music is turned up loud and I am more than 20 30 feet away I will have to yell for it to hear me  If you want privacy you can disable the mic from the app  though it would have been nice to have a physical button like most other voice assistant enable devices  Finally  there is a nifty dock to enable easy charging  Just swap the connector on the bottom and set the speaker on the platform 
Feels just like a wired mouse when it s not plugged in and the battery last super long  10  10 would recommend 
This thing is a beast  It works in my room which is upstairs thru a bunch of walls in my 3 200 sq ft house 
love The WiFi  Bluetooth feature  And it has Alexa my life is complete  The music has not stopped since MegaBlast came into my life   
my son who recently received his meteorology degree from FSU says the midland weather radio is one of the best on the market
This device make life much easier when working with numerous accessories on our entertainment center  One touch is all it takes to select any program contained within our entertainment center 
Our last remove was also a Harmony  The only way to go  Our other one had the bottom worn off  It was time  even though it s pricy  worth every penny 
I am going to start by saying this was not the first surround sound system I have ever purchased but it is the best  I got this to upgrade my game room  theater room  I had an older Sony System that still worked but was showing its age so I moved it off to my wife s TV and got this  Let me tell you the difference in unreal  The quality of the sound is much improved over the old Sony Speakers and my Kenwood speakers before that  Also  the wires and equipment to hook the system to the amplifier are top notch  Nice heavy duty speaker wire is provided which is flexible to make it easy for setup  this is not my first Bose purchase but it is the first surround sound system I have gotten from the company  I will be hard pressed to buy sound equipment from another company going forward  FYI  I did hook the Bose System to a new Sony Amplifier because they give years of trouble free use 
have these installed in a cherokee  stock speakers were shot so I bought these as replacements 
Omg   This was a amazing system I luv the disco lights on it and sounds so great and luv that it is blue2
The best sounding speakers ever used on a job  Beats cheapies by a mile   better sound than Bowers which are more expensive 
This remote was easy to program and the reconized hardware list is hoge
We went from a 4 remote set up to a ONE remote system  We didn t set it up  the Geek Squad did  If someone asked me to help them I wouldn t know how to  It seemed simple   it attaches to the laptop  you go to a website  and input the data  SO EASY to use   There are a few functions we rarely have to use on the other remotes  primarily allowing updates on the TV 
I ve had different out door speakers but these are by far the best  After I broke them in they sounded even better  Deffentlly go with deff tech 
What do you get when you combine the best Bluetooth speaker with Amazon s Echo technology? The UE Megablast Logitech has been putting out great sounding speakers for years with the Ultimate Ears series  And now they have added Amazon s interactive technology to make their speakers that much better  Want to listen to your favorite playlist with a simple voice command? Done  Interested in hearing the day s weather report? You got it  Want to connect to your smart thermostat to adjust your home s temperature? Yes  it can do that too Simply  this speaker eliminates the need for two separate devices in your home  The optional charging dock comes in handy to keep it charged if you plan on moving it often  I keep it docked at all times unless I am taking it outside to do yardwork  The volume is the loudest I have found in a Bluetooth speaker and music does not get distorted even at high levels  Despite combining the capabilities of Alexa and an amazing sounding speaker  the price is still reasonable  I highly recommend this device for anyone that is looking for the highest quality audio mixed with a smart home experience 
These tapes are high quality  I have been using them for over 12 years and have never had a problem 
Installed it and love it  Looks very much like it was designed from scratch to pair with iPhones and preserves an iOS look and feel  CarPlay is extremely intuitive with zero installation  Just connect to USB3 port and go  Cons  The display sits somewhat recessed in the frame  making it very difficult to manipulate the thin line of built in touch sensors without fat fingering some other function  Also not for Android users  obviously  
I use to have the Beats by Dre but the JBL beat them by a mile  If you want headphones that give you an overall sound that is a amazing these are the ones for you 
Bose     hahaha      no way this is like be there      its Amazing clean and clear base
This is do simple to use my 80 year old parents can figure it out  
This has allowed me to watch games at work without signing up for all those other expensive apps to watch ballgames 
Fantastic   it is programmable with a computer MAC or PC  Like how it recognizes all the components   TV  Cable  sound bar  Blu Ray player  Apple TV  Read the reviews and and made the jump to get this and really glad I did  Lives up to all the platitudes previously rendered 
I took my time shopping for a new blue tooth speaker and I am so glad I did  You would not expect a Sony speaker to be on the level with Bose  JBL  etc  but amazingly this speaker tops all of the models that I listened to  I even went to 2 different Best Buy stores for a sanity check and sure enough the Sony wins by a mile 
I am a home theater installer and have been using logitech harmony line of remotes for years  Simply the best 
I was planning on change my car audio for something simple  but when I found this one completely changed my mind the iPhone screen share works awesome
The speaker itself is very nice and works great  But when paired with the app it s very stubborn  And trying to put in party mode is a hassle  If it wasn t for that  it would be 5 stars 
I have always bought Alpine products and never been disappointed  When I installed my new Alpine speakers in my hummer sut the sound was nice and crisp  Defeinatelly not disappointed  Keep up the good products 
I find the Logitech 950 is so small to hold  The keys are tiny  hard to see  and it is probable to press two keys at once  For us  it is very complicated 
While this is a more expensive alternative to a wired iTrip transmitter  it is not expensive compared to its sister products AND it s a great value for the performance  I use this to Bluetooth my smartphone to play music  talk while driving  or get Pandora  Only four stars  losing one for having to reset the tuner to the smartphone every time I get in the car instead of it remembering  However  it may be because I haven t figured out how to fix the setting yet 
a little expensive  it can be used on its own  but its better with the hub 
These speakers replaced factory installed speakers in my 2005 Jeep  They sound fabulous  both for music and podcasts 
What a terrific mouse  Great size and shape  similar to Deathadder from Razer but just a little bit smaller  coupled with terrific switches and sensor  Along with the wireless portion of this it makes a truly terrific mouse that lasted me 2 3 days of heavy use before needing a recharge  My only problem with the mouse was a simply awful scroll wheel that was rattling every time I moved the mouse and was much harder to press compared to other mice I ve used  Overall  I deduct one star simply based off my personal experience and I could have very well have just had a faulty unit in regards to my problems with the mouse wheel  Definitely would recommend this to anyone wanting an FPS mouse 
This is a wonderful keyboard  much improved over the Surface Pro 3 True Type  The fingerprint reader is a nice addition  but it would be better if it could be used to work with  open  apps requiring identification 
Like everything that SVS makes  this is one terrific center channel  I recplaced an old Bose center channel and this just blows it away  Clear  crisp dialogue  A little bright when first used  however  once it is broken in with multiple soundtracks and 20 30 hours of use it settles right in  Just terrific 
The remote doesn t work well  It has locked up several times  Only putting it in the charger seemed to unstick it  Randomly sends signals  Does not turn off the TV most of the time  Not my first Logitech remote  but it is my last  Do not buy one of these monstrosities 
Good luck guys  Once you spend an hour firing up this bad boy and finally get your device to connect and start to play music you won t be able to stop it without physically shutting off the speaker 
This product was the complete opposite of what I expected  It lost battery with charging half of my phone battery and the outlets don t charge unless it s plugged in 
This is my third Logitech Harmony unit and my last  My original was quite good although developed issues  When it finally gave up the ghost I replaced it with the next version which had a touch screen and resolved the issues of the original  Unfortunately  that one was destroyed by water damage after a burst pipe  I replaced it with the Harmony Ultimate One and it is absolutely horrible  The ergonomics are horrendous  it is difficult to use some of the most common buttons without physical gyrations or using two hands  In addition  the touch screen is so sensitive that you are constantly activating things you don t want I switched to a new provider  went from cable to satellite  and the Logitech does not fully support the new device including the fact that it won t bring up the numeric pad on the touch screen  to enter a channel  This means that I still have to resort to the satellite box remote to easily control the box The topper is that after just a little over a year  just enough time for the warranty to run out  the Off button no longer works which now makes the remote control completely useless Just not worth the hassle  I truly believe that Logitech should develop a new remote that fixes these problems and give one  free of charge  to anyone that bought the Ultimate One  It s that bad 
I am a Harmony user  and decided I needed to replace my trusty Harmony One as the buttons have been worn off and the mute button sometimes does not work  SO I picked up the Ultimate  This is the replacement  right It s probably better  right I had read about some people having issues with the button placement and others saying it was no big deal  so I got one  I set it up  instantly using the Harmony software  No one does this better IMO  and started using it  It sucked  The touch screen was slow  much too slow to control a DVR  The hard button placement is STUPID  making them difficult to use  and there is no numeric keypad  Well yes  there is a soft keypad three swipes away on the touch screen  but it s not as fast nor as easy as real buttons  OK  I thought  I am just suffering through a learning curve  I ll get used to it and things will get better  So I lived with it for two months  Struggled with it  I should say  This thing is useless to properly control a DVR  The hard buttons are in the absolute wrong location  The touch screen gesture control works only when it decides to work  and usually if you set the remote down and inadvertently do something when your hand moves over the face   And speaking of setting it down  whoever designed this has never used a remote control in the real world  The bottom is not flat  Yes  it can feel nice in your hand  yes the charging stand is good  but try setting the remote on a table  or worse yet on the curved arm of an easy chair  and watch it roll over  After two months of almost slamming this thing against the wall on numerous occasions  I put it in the drawer and re charged my old design One  Ah  Now I can relax again when I watch TV  THIS is what a remote should be  I am now on the look out for a new old stock Harmony One  And I really hope whoever thought the Ultimate was a good idea has been fired 
Cannot hit play  FF or Rev  etc  without having your hand  arm over the touch pad which is VERY sensitive  The slightest brush can mess up what you are watching  I have to brace my forearm on the bottom part  keep my wrist bent up very high in order to use the playing options  Even then it s not a given it won t sense your arm over the top and change it to a different channel or activity  Also no way to use a number pad that I can find so have to grab another remote to do that  It s a nice idea but very flawed design  It would be much better to have the touch screen at the top at least  and a screen to go to that gives the number  alphabet option 
Half the time the soundbar doesn t turn on  and I have to use the help function  Aso  I have to sect the Blu ray player to operate it  even though I slected Watch Movie  Not worth the hefty price tag  Also  very glitchy and stuff will just turn off if you touch the touchpad by accident 
My old logitech remote got broken so I bought this one hoping it will be better with new features  It s junk  Easy to program but it does work properly  Stay away from this one 
Terrible deck for the money has no options and doesn t even have Bluetooth
Lost cord to leveno laptop  this replacement Cord works great  Great price for coffee pods 
I bought this hoping it would be an upgrade from my much older Harmony Remote that I had for years but is showing age  BIG MISTAKE  This remove has a pitiful display and minimum buttons requiring you to wade thru multiple menus to do simple tasks  It is tedious to use requiring two hands instead of just one with my older unit  So instead of an upgrade  this was a significant down grade 
Omg we live our new remote  Previously we had 4 which was confusing   now one does it all
If you are a tech guy or gal you will love this remote  My remote controls the aquarium lights fan TV  etc   
Product worked well    the tapes were of a high quality
Decent tapes even for HD recording  Best Buy didn t have many is stock though 
Tapes are hard to find  but glad Bet Buy had them  Time to upgrade my recorder though 
Have used these othen with all mySony camcorder recordings  I have had no problems with quality of DVDs  
I GET THIS FOR MY CAMPERA  SO I COULD TAKE FILM OF MY NEW UNIT 
Pretty good remote  just takes some getting used to  Had to replace the remote for my Smart TV  Only down side is that it s not very easy to control just a single component  The Harmony remotes have these new  Activity  Buttons which turn on groups of components and sets them to specific settings for what you want to do  This is pretty nice  except if it doesn t go as it s supposed to  Then you are fumbling through the remote to turn on or set up what ever was missed I would have preferred to just have one that you select what you want to control and that s it 
Keyboard works very well but I m not impressed with the Fingerprint ID feature  It s temperamental and a bit frustrating at times 
Great for work applications or personal use  Allows you to fully maximize your tablets potential 
This thing had great sounding audio and great battery life  Setup was super easy and the firmware update was quick which is great  The big BUT is that the Alexa feature is hampered by a less sensitive microphone than that of the Echo Dot  The Dot microphone is just much more sensitive and works more reliably  There is also no standard 3 5 mm audio AUX jack  If you don

got a question I m trying to hook up to my TV sansui brand do you sell the wiring harness to be compatible with it having hard time connecting it bluetooth with my phone awesome would like hooked up to TV thanks jose
Looks great as my bookshelf system  The quality if the product is engineered well  I would recommend to anyone looking for a system 
It only open main screen  Does not open for passwords
This is a fantastic mouse for a super user who work hard and play hard  The right handed ergonomic grip is very comfortable for both palm and claw grip  For daily use I run it wireless and for gaming I run it wired to skip any possibility for lag  Logitech software makes it easy to set DPI settings  customize buttons  and colors  There s just enough buttons to have a good mix of utility without becoming overwhelming  The only thing I would like to see how of this mouse is Logitech s Hyper Fast scroll wheel  One unexpected feature that I appreciate is the onboard memory that remembers the custom button and dpi settings  I use this mouse on a KVM and it has no problems transitioning custom functions saved on the mouse 
This speaker is very impressive   Probably the key thing to know is that the sound is of great quality and it s loud just like the first generation and I d say this one tops that  It s almost hard to believe you can get that kind of sound out of a small portable speaker but you do with this one  Coupled with it you have Amazon s Alexa built in so it makes it versatile on top of just having great sound   a huge advantage over other speakers  It has the ability to connect via WiFi so you can stream audio directly to the speaker and can use Alexa to control it  With Alexa of course  you can do a lot of different things like controlling smart devices such as lights or appliances or simply use it to control audio  get news updates  etc  If you can t connect to WiFi or have it out and about you can connect directly to your phone or tablet to stream your audio directly to the speaker  The design is solid and simple  All in all  I d very much recommend this speaker if you re looking for a good high quality speaker that is flexible and can be used both at home on the dock and on the go  Pros Loud high quality sound and bass  quite impressive for it s size   Great battery lifeWiFi and Bluetooth ConnectivityOptional charging base makes it easy to chargeMicro USB ChargingExternal controls and can also be voice controlled with AlexaCons None so far 
Sony and Best Buy s Deal of the Day come through in a big way  This speaker has crisp  clear sound with very good bass for its size  I am more than thrilled with this purchase 
This baby is awesome  We have this product in our 400 sq ft garage and its work perfect for when I work out  So far no issues with it  If your looking for a a cheap BT speaker system this will work  I can here this thing from across the street  Highly recommend if you are looking
I own an embarrassing number of headphones priced from  12 00 to  700 00  I collect headphones and am very critical about what I like When I first listened to these I was very disappointed and was thinking of returning them  But like some of my headphones they required burn in to reach their true potential  Well after running them through a burn in app they really opened up  The bass became controlled going deep with impact  Mid s are creamy but some what recessed  High s are clean with a bit of sparkle  Soundstage is good for closed back cans  Build quality is excellent with a very impressie style  If you want a pair of headphones with outstanding style backed up with great sound these are for you  These are not Beats with bloated unnatural bass and poor sound quality  If all you want is style and bloated bass these are not for you 
I found this Bose System to be slightly better than my older Yamaha system  It lacks the clarity and depth I would have expected from Bose  The subwolfer cosmetic design is bad   the speaker wires and power cord are on the underside of the unit  Makes it difficult to install  Additionally  there is no power indicator or on off 
I reluctantly bought the keyboard for my new Microsoft Surface Pro 4  because I felt I had to have one  Keyboard for other tablets  like my iPad  but was pleasantly surprised with this one  The keys are sufficiently clicky  without that mushy feel of many portable keyboards  Key layout is just right for touch typing I don t use the fingerprint reader much  it was easy to set up  though  I bought this keyboard primarily for the color  and would have chosen a black one without a fingerprint reader if it was available   The Microsoft Hello system is surprisingly good for logging you in  
I did not expect to like this keyboard as much as I do   not as good as a full keyboard  but very close 
Sound shuts off Every day after playing for 9 hours  Took 3rd party seller a bit to get it settled Returned the TV  Must say picture was good but def had a problem
Didn t know how far they ve come with universal remotes in the last five years  This is an amazing leap in technology since my last remote  Easy to set up using a computer  Just plug it in and follow the steps  It ask how you ve set up your system and your model numbers  That s it  Unplug it from your computer and you re ready to go  It has a digital screen that behaves much like a smart phone You choose   Whatch TV     Whatch DVD  etc  You can also have custom settings like     Play Pandora  click your choice and it does all the work If something doesn t come on right  Like if you don t point it right  just click  Fix  and it will correct and issue you have No more batteries  It s rechargeable with a base 
The Surface Pro Type Cover has one issue  Touch pad too easily activated during typing 
The surface pro type cover keyboard does everything it claims  I love it 
It is a perfect product for my Surface Pro  fast   easy access 
Keyboard fits well on the Surface Pro as expected  The feel was much better than expected 
Best purchase of my life  Trying to do remote with Apple product with Microsoft product  thumbs down  Surface most phenomenal  thanks
Okay keyboard fingerprint works greatBacklight is helpful and useful Would like to see the unit made more ridged 
I have been an avid Beats Studio Wireless user for the past 5 years  but they tend to break every two years or so  I have always bought the exstended warranty and BB has replaced them with no hassle  but this time they said they are no longer selling warranty on Beats    Something to do with Apple owning Beats now  So I went into panic mode and started trying all of the wireless models in the store and reading the reviews online  I ended up buying the JBL Elite 700 and I love love love them    What an awesome headphone    Crystal clear sound and bass drops when it needs to  J Cole  Adele  or LynardSkinner    Amazing sound regardless of what I am jamming to  Highly recommended   
We put this TV in our large kitchen to show videos of cooking recipes and play internet content while cooking big meals  The picture is great  the remote is easy to use  and the internet ready apps are the most popular ones  Overall  a great buy 
I purchased four of these speakers when they were selling for buy one get one half off  Replaced the stock speakers in my 08 Spectra and these things hit HARD  The bass was considerably noticeable right away compared to stock  I am adding an Alpine headunit to go with them as I have read it will really help get maximum performance out of them  If you re looking for a moderately cheap speaker set to give you good sound  these are the way to go  Alpine continues to impress and their products are second to none 
Bought these for my hearing impaired husband  He is highly impressed with the sound and ease of pairing via blue tooth  Superb to anything else he has tried 
Great all around mouse with a super accurate sensor and fast sensor  Highly recommended 
Awesome head unit  Installed in my boat perfectly  No complaints yet  Powers my stock speakers amazingly  The remote is kinda spotty tho  Hasnt worked for me yet except when it is a foot from the head unit 
Spent more than an hour at the store listening  deliberating between Sony and Bose  Sony hands down won  Features like easy one touch pairing with my Samsung phone  long battery life  power bank charger  rubbery case is well made than Bose s plastic exterior  lights are awesome and classier compared to JBL s tacky lava like lights and the SOUND is SUPERB    Was able to play it out of the box  Did not download the app  very satisfied with the quality of the sound  At max volume  sound frequencies like highs  mids and lows are maintained and does not get distorted thus I found no need to have an equalizer from the app  Always take into consideration the source   Pandora  Spotify  Youtube  Mp3  etc   you re getting the music from because it s crucial to the overall output of the sound  I listen to Pandora and recordings are consistently crisp  full and clear  Some sites have inferior recordings  no matter how much tweaking you do with an equalizer it will still produce an inferior  muffled and distorted sound  Another feature I ve noticed is when paused for a considerable amount of time  it turns itself off  Compared to the XB40  XB30 IMO delivered a crispier  undistorted sound at max volume  XB40 was slightly louder  a given  Could not be happier with my choice  Growing up Sony was already a household name in quality and performance  With the proliferation of newer and good brands in the market today  Sony has retained its global reputation of excellence in electronics technology  Time spent at Best Buy wasn t wasted and was on sale  Lastly  the red is gorgeous  More like red orange 
Sound quality and comfort are the top qualities  The most functional fun is the adjustable ambient noise level with the button or through the app on your phone I m so glad I finally splurged on a top shelf piece of equipment 
I am older  57  and hard of hearing  I wear hearing aids but not when I listen to music   I have two pair of moderately priced   100    150  Audio Technica and AKG headphones and have never been pleased with their sound quality when compared to my speaker  subwoofer system  Being at a stage in life where I can afford the price point of the Bowers and Wilkins P7  I spent a lot of time researching higher end headphones  I had narrowed down my search to the P7s and the Sennheiser Momentums and then auditioned both at Best Buy  It was a hard choice  but I found the P7s to be a little more comfortable for my noggin  Both of these are a little too bulky and heavy to use while out and about with a mobile device  but I use them only at home  I have never owned a Bowers and Wilkins product but was well aware of their reputation in the audiophile world  If you appreciate finely crafted products  the P7s will not disappoint you in any way  Their styling  while subjective   material choice  and sound quality  again a subjective characteristic  most definitely met and exceeded my expectations  An all around wonderful product 
These are amazingly clear and retain the classic B W warm and fun sound  I look forward more now than ever to listening to my music 
I recommend this speaker sounds very nice love the lights
This speaker is great for training classes and presentations 
This thing is so simple that even my wife can use it   That sounds mean  but if you knew my wife  you would know that she used to call me at work to ask me how to turn on the TV because we had too many remotes with different button configurations  Now she can operate the remote and I am more productive at work than I ve ever been 
Excellent for camping and working away from home so you can enjoy life  With family and friends  
These headphones really block out the noise while staying true to the audio fidelity 
These connected to my phone via Bluetooth real fast with no problems at all  The unit is sleek and a good size  but isn t compact  I carry it inside a backpack  but I can see how it would be too bulky for a laptop case  This unit generates loud music 
I installed these DDR4 RAM modules into my stepson s tower  Added to his existing 16GB  the now total of 32GB makes his system hum like a song  His older RAM still onboard is Samsung  but there are no conflicts  We ve encountered no errors and he s reported zero latency in gaming since the upgrade  Everything was getting sluggish as he had done software upgrades  so the added RAM was perfectly timed  The lifetime warranty is a no brainer on selecting this brand  I was grounded with a grounding strap when I installed the memory  so no worries there   but memory can fail  It s nice to know that if that ever comes up  we re covered 
This gizmo solved my internet connection problem  And
fast desktop ever  fast CPU  big memory  decent display adapter 
I was nervous about my dad and girlfriend using this remote  But its played out and worked well  The battery dies pretty quick when its left on the bed because it lights up every time someone moves  But I m happy with the remote purchase 
I love the remote and the gestures that let you turn on several devices at the touch of one button  The only downside is that it does it work with the fire tv
I was one of those people who said that I would never pay for a universal remote  especially one over  50  I mean  how lazy must you be not to be able to use the remotes that came with your devices    right? That was until I was hunting for my missing Roku remote and  in the process  discovered that I had 13 remotes in my 2 bedroom apartment  Between the streaming device remotes  the TVs  the gaming stations  the blu ray player and soundbar  my coffee tables and night stand were cluttered with remotes  That s the time that I started thinking    just thinking    about a universal remote  When I saw that Logitech s One remote was for sale  for 50% off  I decided to jump on the opportunity  I was intimidated at first  but Logitech s software was SO EASY to use  I simply entered the model numbers of my devices and Logitech worked through the rest of the programming and automatically worked out the combo functions like turning on the TV and soundbar  changing the TV input and turning on the gaming console when I want to play Xbox  It works flawlessly  Now I carry around one remote to control all the audio  video components in my apartment 
Love this product  Got for my grandma and she loves it too
this was very easy to hook up to my computer  I am very happy with the purchase
You can t argue with the price  Once I found the right screwdriver this took me less than 10 minutes from start to finish  Works great in a Mid 2009 MBP 13  
The device is super easy and super fast  I love the security too 
I already have one of these for our main living room and love it  So of course when I outfitted my game room in my barn loft I just had to get a second one 
Super audio addition to my system  No wires to screw with   unit can be turned off or on as needed  Quality very good for such a small amp 
Super  Meets my needs  Will upgrade soon  Good service 
Tienen buen sonido se las recomiendo a familiares y amistades
Poor quality not HD   has annoying connection issues keep in mind I have a belkin that works just fine  I wouldn t pay more than 30 bucks for this piece of s**t 
Feels much more durable  The fingerprint scanner is great  Only real issue is if you have the original docking station it won t stay folded up
So far it is in the box  but I am optimistic by the appearance it will be great Sometimes the brilliant colors of the box and the catchy phrases say it all When we do finally get it open and begin playing  I m sure that all of the family will be very impressed and the marketing genius s will have earned their pay 
The Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is an amazing product  Astonishingly thin and light  it is still a comfort to type on even for extended periods  It was fun to consider various color options  but none of the options spoke to me like the Alcantara covered Signature edition  This cover has a rich feel and a color that compliments the body of the Surface Pro very well  Matched with the included Surface Pen  this looks like a set of products designed together  As a keyboard  any color Type Cover 4 represents clever and useful technology  Wrapped in Alcantara  the cover is all that and more 
Solid headset   good sound quality   great for travelers  folds up in nice bag that is included 
This is a great and secure mount  The walls in my house are plaster and not drywall so I was leary mounting a 46  tv but this mount is pretty secure  It was quick to install with a mounting guide that came with and I was able to hang it by myself  The only con I had was the cable management but it s not a big issue for me 
Sturdy and looks great  Only downside is that even though you re able to move the TV horizontally on the mount  unless it s centered on the mount  the weight of the TV causes it to tilt noticeably in one direction or the other 
I bought this wall mount for my 64  Samsung  having never hung a tv before  I wanted a full motion wall mount  which is what this says it is  however it doesn t move  tilt as much as the full motion mount displayed in the store  Overall though  I m very happy with my purchase 
The fingerprint reader was a cool option  but my reason was that this is a bit stronger than the original keyboard  I like the surface  but typing mobile has been a pain  This helps 
This is one of the best sounding  deepest bass subs around     I love everything about power acoustic    Sonic is my only place to shop  
Though the system can be slow to start up  the software is great and the system is easy to use 
Good quality  operates as advertised  and plenty strong for my 55 inch flat panel TV 
This is heavy duty so be sure to find wall studs  I put up an older flat screen which was extremely heavy  probably at the weight limit   It holds wonderfully after some finagling to adjust the TV tilting  Clear yourself plenty of floor space and move things out of your way  Between lots of screws and bolts and tools  you ll want to get the TV out of the way and lay everything out to see  You ll also need your tools like tape measure  stud finder  screwdrivers of various types and sizes  At points this is a two person job such that I held some weight of the TV while my husband lined up screw holes  just to make sure the TV wouldn t tip over   better safe than sorry   I suppose for the super slim description  it is for all the motion it has  It s very tight so moving up  down  left  right is not as smooth as I d hoped  The photos show the distance from wall to TV which is the length of a CD  then the photo of the mount extended  then a photo of the part of the mount that is on the wall  then a photo of the mount parts attached to the TV  You will noticed in the next photo that the cable wire attached to the rear of the TV prevents the swivel completely to the left although the next photo shows that the swivel is still quite a bit  Probably just me but I use two hands to move TV in any direction  still getting used to the TV not falling off   I do love the freedom of sitting in a chair in a corner of the room or sitting on the couch straight on or laying on the couch  Glad we made this purchase on Amazon  Way better price than Best Buy  etc  Shipping was fast  to the door  and packed really well 
excited to hang up our new large screen TV but was bitterly disappointed to find the exact item on Ebay for 1  2 the price 
Love the power and great sound  Crisp and clear music 
Very strong and works well and looks great in our room 
I think this is a strong mount for a 75in  TV over the fireplace  I gave it a 4 rating only because of where it is located  its hard to pull out and especially push back by yourself without putting your hand on the screen  the only way I do it is to use a stool to get up higher for a better leverage standpoint  Two people do it a lot easier from the floor  I feel confident that the mount doesn t feel weak or give you the feeling that it won t hold the TV so I do like it for the different ways it moves and the strength 
This jet pack is very easy to use  The wifi signal is very strong even when the jet pack is in the trunk of my car  The only drawback it takes a minute for the jetpack to connect to your devices 
Like the ability to steam what my TiVo cannot when I m out of the home 
I purchased this as part of my move to NYC in an attempt to save some cash with cable costs and such  The Slingbox was connected at my parent s house in VA  We could never stream at HQ  only the medium quality  Not sure if this was attributed to the uploads  download speeds  but we have 50 mbps speeds at both ends  which I believe is pretty fast  Aside from the lackluster streaming quality  it was a pretty seamless installation  However  the fact that I couldn t stream at HQ leads me to a 3 star rating 
Too sensitive to inadvertent keystrokes causing change of device or live program  Needs a lockout to prevent Update 2016 06 21I have tried for a year to like this remote and I find myself lowering my rating by 1 star to only 1 star  Functionally things are as they should be and the unit is highly programmable  however  as originally stated  the remote is just to sensitive to stray keystrokes  Bad things happen when using this remote  you will be watching a live program  perhaps even on a few minute delay and any stray stroke can change the inputs from live TV to Radio or another channel  totally losing your live feed  My suggestion to anyone using this remote to watch live TV is to record EVERYTHING you want t see or you will on more than one occasion lose what you are trying to see Also  the back button is too close to the CH  PG button  Many times I have changed the channel rather than skipping back 30 seconds  causing all the same problems as above  losing the live feed  losing time delayed feeds and losing key minutes of programming I regret to say that I am going to sell this remote on eBay and revert back to my original Harmony 880  The 880 had some of the same problems but too a MUCH lesser degree 
I read a review on amazon and I should of taken her advice   stops working ALL the time  too late to return to BB so the mfg  sent a replacement and the same thing   stops working    now the mfg  will give me a credit for a more expensive set by the same mfg  that s like throwing more      for a product that well still stop working   and by the way   BB was no help at all with this product      
This is the most user hostile product I have ever purchased  EVER  Just when you sit down to watch your favorite show  the remote stops working you have to sync the remote or install yet another firmware update  Sometimes this requires you to connect the remote to your computer which must be in the same room as the hub  This takes several minutes  After the updates  you will have to go through rearrange all your screens the way you had them before which is a pain in the butt when all you wanted to do was sit down to relax watch some TV After only 18 months  our remote would only show the Harmony logo would not go any further  When I called Logitech s customer support  they walked me through some troubleshooting then told me that I would need to buy a new remote  Not over my dead body   If you like waste your money you like lots of stress  than this is the product for you 
It stops working completely after eight months  When attached to the SP4  it s as if it is not connected  there is no back light  key presses  the fingerprint reader and the track pad do not have any response  Also tried it on my friend s SP4  it does not work either  While my friend s type cover works on my SP4  My SP4 has the latest update  and I also tried two button shutdown and reinstalling the driver  
Terrible  stopped working after two weeks  I do not recommend
By far the best remote out there  I had an older version that I finally wore out after lots of use and many years  Then I bought a UR Universal Remote on a recommendation  What a piece of junk  None of these better remotes are cheap but for the money this is the most reliable  easiest to use and best designed that I ve found  You will love this remote 
No problems at all with drive  Still working fine months after purchase 
WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS Still learning this remote a month later  Yikes  a far cry from our Harmony One 
Waiting for my promised receipt  It s been a couple of weeks
I prefer multiple small drives instead of one big one  It s quicker to recover from failure and a bit cheaper  I ve got three running strong for 3yrs 24  7 and just added two more  No regrets with these drives 
We had this remote and bought another one   The TV turns off for no reason and we can not use our fire stick or Apple TV  The Geek Squad is not a good set up team  By the remote and hire someone else to program  We will have our old technician set it up 
Sometimes I am frustrated because my phone and kindle have lost contact sonce the last time they were used

love the lighting  sound  easy to use  love the remote control
I was told to get alpine for my sons car and they helped me find the right size  They are perfect 
I never got to hear what kind of sound quality it would produce because the stereo deck was bad right out of the box  It was hooked up properly according to the directions  wiring diagram and it wouldn t power up When I checked it with a multimeter it didn t have continuity through itself internally 
Ong I love muaic and so happy I found this stereo was looking for one like this  Love it
Broke my Onyx EZ  for  10 00 more  I upgraded to the Onyx EZR  All the accessories interchanged  I was able to use the upgraded dash mount  purchased separately   More channel presets than the EZ 
I just got these in time for my 4th of July party  Broke them in for a few days prior to party  I use them on zone 2 of a Yamaha RX V673 Receiver and they are amazing  I had high expectations based on other reviews  and the reputation of the brand  But hearing the deep base thump  the powerful balanced mids  and crisp highs all together blew me away  They filled my backyard with sound  an area of about 75 feet by 100 feet  They are well built and feel just heavy enough  The integrated mounting brackets are super easy to use and make adjusting the angle extremely easy  Make sure you have enough power to drive them and you should be very happy 
Following in the prestigious heritage of the Everest line from JBL  the Elite 700 sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones  Though not a new type of product  in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents  The Elite 700s is nicely presented in a cut out  Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located  This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection  as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage  Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps  Beneath the box is the one button standard 3 5 to 2 5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies  Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and  or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware  Lastly  we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly  Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate  however  the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3 5mm input jack  the micro USB charge and sync port  as well as the built in microphone  Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button  which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom  Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button  the play  pause  answer  hang up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button The Elite 700 has a companion app  which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store  Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive  You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you  It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low  medium or high or off  You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own  Moving back  you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger  Lastly  you can activate TruNote  which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum  and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it  The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be  I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured hey  I have a 30 day return window  whats there to lose? Well  these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential  The wireless mode alone is simply excellent  The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution  but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven  The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25  but not quite there  With ANC off  these sound great  Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance  I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response  but in stock  they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm  very slight  I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off  the bass is tight  quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass  It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease  but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless  The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open  clean  articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone  No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity  none  Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick  it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers   Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2  For a wireless headphone  this is honestly quite amazing  When the Elite 700 is wired  they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity  From the stellar 15 23 hour battery life  to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list 
Following in the prestigious heritage of the Everest line from JBL  the Elite 700 sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones  Though not a new type of product  in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents  The Elite 700�s is nicely presented in a cut out  Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located  This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection  as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage  Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps  Beneath the box is the one button standard 3 5 to 2 5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies  Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and  or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware  Lastly  we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly  Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate  however  the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3 5mm input jack  the micro USB charge and sync port  as well as the built in microphone  Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button  which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom  Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button  the play  pause  answer  hang up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button The Elite 700 has a companion app  which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store  Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive  You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you  It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low  medium or high or off  You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own  Moving back  you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger  Lastly  you can activate TruNote  which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum  and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it  The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be  I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured �hey  I have a 30 day return window  what�s there to lose?� Well  these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential  The wireless mode alone is simply excellent  The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution  but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven  The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25  but not quite there  With ANC off  these sound great  Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance  I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response  but in stock  they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm  very slight  I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off  the bass is tight  quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass  It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease  but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless  The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open  clean  articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone  No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity  none  Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick  it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers   Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2  For a wireless headphone  this is honestly quite amazing  When the Elite 700 is wired  they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity  From the stellar 15 23 hour battery life  to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list 
Wow  We ve had a harmony remote for years   love it   the buttons were getting challenging to use and I thought   why not get a new remote that has more features Terrible mistake   this Ultimate One is NOT intuitive to set up   the remote setup features through the website is a fine idea   however the remote activity setup is not simple and not intuitive The remote has too few buttons   not enough hard buttons means you have to scroll through touchscreens to get to the commands you want and when you are there   the other hard button commands don t work Eventually I was able to determine how to customize the existing hard buttons to function how I need them to   the issue I have is that this is not a simple process It simply takes too long to do what you want and the simple  everyday  hard buttons that you need and use all the time are no longer there  It takes a lot of customization to get what you need and want Certainly challenging   I think over time I will be able to get this programmed the way I want   I hope 
I was expecting this remote to be a bit more user friendly  I have to update it all the time and changing the channels is a task  Not a seemless process 
My Sling is connected to Verizon Fios box  I used the RCA connection to connect from the FIOS box to SLING and then another RCA connection to connect to a TV  FIOS does not allow using HDMI for two outputs  The picture is stable  sound is great   The remote is on the screen and easily learnt  It was easy setup and I am very happy with my purchase 
Good speakers but overall I honestly expected more for something at a  300 price point that could also connect with more streaming devices
SRS ZR7 delivers a strong sense of deep bass  doesn t distort  the bass actual sounds fuller and richer  never sounds thin  but you do get a greater presence from the high mids and highs and less from the deepest lows 
These speakers are worth every penny  Best outdoor speakers I ve ever had 
We bought these for my son and ended up returning them the same day  The volume level is extremely low  When playing music it sounded  tinny  
DO NOT BUY THESE I want to preface this review by saying that I have purchased over 50 sets of heaphones over the years  and used 100s of them to listen to music  I have bought and used sets from all categories and pricepoints  including professional musician in ears meant for stage performance  and those meant for recording studio monitoring and producing records When I saw this set of headphones for half off  I quickly ordered them  They seemed to fit the bill of what I was looking for  and the reviews were deceptively high  I needed something sturdy enough to handle the work environment  and something capable enough to receive bluetooth in an obstacle laden work area  I spend most of the work day in a laboratory  not at a desk  Maybe this is a suitable product for those whom are allergic to getting their hands dirty It was my oversight that this set only has 40mm drivers  The lack of bass response shows this  especially at higher volume  I have an extremely capable pair of audio technica ATH ESW9 that way outshine this set without breaking a sweat These headphones are also lacking a fwd  rev skip button to move to the last or next track  It is also used to rid your ears of that extremely annoying youtube ad  That is a huge design flaw in my opinion  Ads will not be disappearing any time soon  and my cheap motorola behind the neck bluetooth headphones from years back have this feature  When you place your phone 20 40 feet away at your desk  it is not convenient to just touch the screen and do this manually I was also disheartened to see that when I set these down on a sheet of paper on my desk  the printed words bled through into the ear cup material  That is something I have not ever seen a headphone do  no matter what color or pricepoint  Whatever dye they use for these must be poor quality  as they are also turning yellow after only a few weeks of daily use The battery life is longer than any other set in the price point  and was a welcomed plus The graduated ambient sound monitor is nice in theory  but really is not that noticeable  It is better to just slide one ear cup behind your ear instead If HARMAN had spent more money beefing up the basics  this set would be so much better than the competition I will be returning these  as I cannot justify keeping them  even at half price 
Seems like fast access and if like my other WD Red drives  it should be reliable  Nothing but positive at this point 
It is fast  powerful and one of the easiest pc s to upgrade  alter I ve ever seen In a way  this machine is a throwback in terms of versatility  who needs a stinkin  xBox  and do it yourself ability  but with state of the art tech  Wish they still wrote lots of games for PC s Some reviewers have mentioned lag issues  but  for me  this seemed to have come solely from wifi interference 
Went from 560 Mbs to 1 3 Gbs in 5Ghz  Simple to install 
After installation the speakers souded very good  i recommend to all who needs to change out their speakers 
I am happy with my purchase of these 6x8 speakers I installed in the rear of my mustang  I will be buying another set to put on the doors
Great sound  installed amp as well  They couldn t really handle the amp with the gain turned up  but without it they sound incredible
I needed a low cost speaker system for a Valentines gift I was making for my wife  The speakers sound great    especially considering their price point 
The speakers were installed in a timely fashion and sound great 
The speakers fit as required  They sound great and work as advertised 
Great quality sound    bass is perfect   would recommend to all
The speakers sound great in my vehicle  They were easy to install and I love listening to them 
Love our new speakers for our truck  They were easy to install and the techs were extremely helpful with all of our questions 
The speakers sound great  easy to install  Love these 
Speaker is fantastic  Bigger than the Megaboom and louder than imagined 
The speaker is solid and feels very nice and is portable  It is a little heavier than I would like  I wanted this so I could use it by the pool during the summer and not worry about it falling over or getting wet  The set up was extremely easy and the buttons were easy to press and responsive  I love the lighting that blinks to the beat  The main reason for not giving this 5 stars is the sound  It does not sound as dynamic  the sound just come straight at you  it does not surround you  When you press the extra bass button it is ok  I was hoping this would sound amazing because I have their wireless TV speaker system and headphones  but was disappointed  I love Sony products so I will not give up on this speaker  At this price point I would consider it 
Speaker hit and worked very well but didn t last too long  already burned out
Am taking it back today   within a month  Volume began to diminish and now it will not turn on  A sales person recommended it  and I listened to it in the store  thinking it was good Within weeks it has turned into junk 
Works great I ve used it outside mostly and very pleased with it
Works as expected  some issues with Bluetooth connectivity at times  if you have a connection issue forget the device on your phone and try again
Music can be heard as if your right at the concert   But no bass so loud u can t understand vocally sound also
We bought this Bluetooth speaker and love it  It has a nice sound  Good bass and has a long battery life 
Easy to install  We have ours on the back porch mounted to the house  They sound great 
These do sound particularly good  I like them better than the PSB M4U and possibly better than my Sennheiser HD 580 s  unfortunately I can t wear them for more than 30 minutes before they get to be painful  If they fit differently they would be winners  Worth trying to find out if they fit you 
You can start a party anywhere with this speaker thanks to the built in light show PROs  Sound quality  Obviously  one of the most important features of a speaker is the sound quality  The Sony XB30 certainly does not disappoint  Highs and mids come through clear and bass had some kick to it  if it s not enough for you  you can press the  Extra Bass  button for an enhanced effect   I tested streaming music from Apple Music  Pandora and Slacker Radio and was not disappointed with the sound quality of this speaker   Lights  I know some may find this gimmicky  but I really like the lights on this speaker  There is the outer ring that surrounds the speaker on the front that changes different colors and two white LED  strobe  lights on either side  You can set the lights to dance with the music  set a more calming lighting effect or turn off the lights completely by using the SongPal app  The lights really to add a bit of a party atmosphere and helps this speaker stand out from other brands   Bass booster  A quick press of  Extra Bass  button substantially increases lows and adds a great bass effect  especially considering the size of this speaker  However  it can make some songs sound a little  muddy  with an overemphasis on lows   NFC pairing  If your phone features an NFC chip  it can be used to quickly pair to this speaker with a tap    Speakerphone support  You can answer incoming calls on this speaker by tapping the  phone  button  I tested this out and my friend said the sound quality was very good and he could hear me fine  However  if I stepped too far to one side  the noise cancellation feature seems to kick in and makes my voice harder to hear  so be sure you re in front of the speaker while using the phone feature   Siri support  You can also call up Siri by tapping the phone button and speaking a command   Bluetooth standby  A unique feature of this speaker is that you can leave it plugged in to an AC outlet and it will automatically turn on when you start playing music on your phone  It will go into standby mode  waiting for the next time you play music  if nothing plays for a period of time  This feature can be enabled in SongPal app   Charge your phone  The speaker has a USB port on the back  You can use your own charging cable to plug into this port and charge your phone while the speaker is on  This would obviously decrease the runtime of the speaker  but it can come in handy in a pinch   Pair with other Sony XB30 speakers  Another unique feature is the ability to pair this Bluetooth speaker with another similar Sony Bluetooth speaker  The other speakers must support the  Wireless Party Chain  function  which currently includes the SRS XB20   SRS XB30 and SRS XB40  Up to 10 speakers can be connected   Aux in  Non Bluetooth devices can be used by using an audio cable with stereo mini plugs  not included  CONs  Proprietary charger  Unfortunately  this speaker cannot be recharged with a standard Micro USB or USB C charger  It uses a barrel connector  meaning that you need to remember to bring the included charger with you  and make sure you don t lose it    Fully charging the speaker takes about 4 hours   No battery life indicator on iOS  Many newer Bluetooth speakers display their battery level on the iPhone  iPad status bar  so you can see when your speaker needs recharged  This Sony XB30 speaker does not do that  although you can use the SongPal app to find it  it s buried under the Settings option in the app   You can also hold down the  phone  button for about 3 seconds and the speaker will announce its current charge   Buggy SongPal app  This speaker seems to use a separate Bluetooth connection when using the app  as I frequently receive messages from the SongPal app that my speaker needs to be paired even while it is currently streaming music from the same device  I ve also seen multiple instances of the speaker appear in the app even though I m only using one  so it looks like the SongPal app has some kinks to work out Overall  I m really happy with the sound quality of this speaker and the light show is a nice added bonus 
Honestly less setup is better  I managed to get this working as a Cast device  I still can t figure out Bluetooth  Sony needs to dumify their stuff   go talk to Apple  Other than that  the sound is great 
I will start off by saying  I am using this speaker to play music in my office  The speaker sounds great at low volumes  but tends to distort and sound a little tinny at higher volumes  If this speaker were around   50  it would probably be a 4 or 5 star for me  but for  300  I come to expect more  Fortunately  I got it open box so got a bit of a discount  The SongPal app is terrible as well 
I purchased these speakers to replace my 6 1  2 inch speakers in my 17 SeaRay bow rider and they sound and work great  easy to install and fit just right 
Sounded better in the store but it still sounds great 
Got these speakers along with a new Alpine radio for my truck  They sound great 
Installed these in my workout room  Such great sound that I put a second pair on the patio  What great sound 
Nice features for the price and Sounds Great 
Purchased this speaker for my office but have also used it for other outdoor events  It sounds great 
These door or panel speakers are awesome  Sounds like I have amazing 5 1 in the car 
These speakers sound great  No downsides  The bass has plenty of loudness  Range of sound is beautiful 
bought 2 of them  one for my son took hook to hs phone and 1 for my work computer  love them
Sounds great in my truck   I have a 1990 f150  I put them in my door panels and to be the only speakers in my truck they sounds great

Great Bluetooth speaker and battery has good charge
I d listened to *a lot* of Bluetooth speakers during my research before buying this speaker  In the price range  the hear go sounded much better than almost any other unit  It doesn t sound like a tin can  as most of these boxes do  The only thing it s missing is better water resistance  but for me that was an OK option to give up  It has features other boxes don t  wi fi chromecast  for example   It s really probably the best option in this price range  I d recommend it to anybody 
Sounds great
works well in conjunction with larger Sony speaker  great value
Alexa works great  my boy loved it especially asking for jokes  He plays his music on a fly
Bought this for my daughter  it is her first blue tooth speaker but I have had several  Sound is great  she loves the design and the light  she s 17  not so much for me  Very happy 
Easy to use sounds great   Lightweight and easy to take to soccer practice 
i got these for my daughters car and they sound great
I liked the headphones they were very easy to pair to my tv and sound great
Only issue is with Bluetooth and connecting to second iphone  Have not figured that out yet  but sound is great and quality is outstanding 
Pretty loud for size  Wish it had a forward button
Purchased for a party but wanted something portable  Great sound for the price  Will buy a second for pairing 
Speaker produces nice sound and takes up a small amount of space  Only wish it had a remote so the power could be turned off and on from a distance 
Speaker sounds great  Plays while charging too  No complaints
Used for rear surround  works great  Easy install 
Very happy with this speaker  Sounds loud and when you hit the bass it makes it sound even better  Highly recommend 
Speaker has great sound for the size and is easy to connect to Connection between other Sony speakers is a bit confusing at first but works very well 
Nice compact with battery and decent sound  At low to middle volumes it sounds pretty good  When you crank it up though  the bass disappears ~ likely to prevent the speaker from distorting  Feels well built 
The sound quality is very good for such a small speaker  However these speakers are extremely difficult to connect to the sound bar and subwoofer  it requires an online APP  to connect them together through WIFI  They constantly disconnect and require going back through the APP to connect  Also does not work with TV audio  Employee claims an update is in the works  I hope he is telling the truth  otherwise don t buy 
My husband loves these speakers  Sounds great and pretty loud 
Put in my 2002 Trans Am after original blew  Hooked up nicely 
Very well sounding headphone but get the warranty cuz one drop and you may have problems
the Sony Zr7 sounds great   its heavy for its size  The only draw back is I wish it had apple airplay built in 
I absolutely love this speaker  I have 3 total  2 hooked up to my soundbar  surround sound  theater  and 1 For multi room use  I just love the sound quality that it produces  Awesome for its size 
Sound and clarity are perfect  Exactly as I wanted to hear in a small speaker 
Was looking for something for the pool and beach but I should of went with something bigger
These headphones sounded good but I don t think they were worth the price  I ended up returning them and getting a pair of skullcandy s that were not quite as good but good enough to save  200
These speakers sound very good for the type of jazz music I like to listen to in the car  I followed the advice of the BBuy installer and replaced my front door speakers  I plan to buy a second pair of Alpines for the rear deck 
The sound is more clear with more base than the stock speakers in my 2013 F150FX4  The speakers are not a direct match for the existing wiring harness  I was able to find a harness that matched the existing harness and the new speakers  Once the new harness arrived the new speakers and harness plugged right in  no splicing required 
head phone demo at store sounded much better than what I got but live and learn  Have spent a bit of money at best buy very dissapointed
was looking for a new portable speaker and this was recommended by the store s sales associate  The sound is very good but I have experienced issues with charging the speaker and would prefer if there was a designated on  off switch witch it does not have 
Sound is ok but not as expected for a 1800 watt system  Wish there was a way to add on to speaker wire  They are too short  Overall sound is decent
I own and have used the Ultimate Ears Boom speaker that I ve had for the past 5 6 years or so and it has been my favorite bluetooth speaker I ve ever had  After hearing about this new Ulimate Ears MEGABLAST speaker  I was thrilled and couldn t wait to receive it in the mail  I knew this would be my new permanent replacment for my aging BOOM speaker  with the increasingly dwindling battery  But  a few bugs and inconsistencies keep it from exceeding my expectations  It ll still be my new daily use speaker First of all  let me explain why the original UE BOOM was my favorite speaker  I ve got some hearing loss issues and my right ear has only about 15% hearing  it s really only good for picking up bass  lol   So  when I choose a new speaker or pair of headphones  earbuds  they have to be able to get loud enough for a comfortable level for me  but yet even louder when I want to  crank  it  I use all my bluetooth devices on my iPad Pro 10 5  and my new iPhone X  The BOOM speaker has never failed me  I watch Twitch tv daily  usually for about 6 hours on average while I do my work  I ve used my BOOM for many years like this and I ve only kept the volume up between the 3 4 notch  this is maybe 1  3 the max volume on the device volume bar  for everything I listen to and never had an issue hearing So  I was definitely excited to get this  I couldn t wait to unbox it  get it charged and synced to my devices  Let s break it down Packaging This was where I was most impressed  The packaging on the outside didn t look like anything fancy  But  it s when you break the seal and pull the slip cover off the box    The inside box the speaker is housed in is made of a super thick and durable cardboard and I was totally not expecting the amazing artwork  It s so bright and colorful and I immediately thought   they ve put a lot of love into this making and designing this speaker and box  Inside the box  the cylindrical speaker is nestled in perfectly curved black styrofoam and matches everthing else  It s very snug and secure  Along with the speaker  you also get the normal  minimal instructions  it s a bluetooth speaker  not rocket science   USB power cable and the larger than my old one power brick  The cable and brick are both white  perfectly contrasting with the black speaker Design This speaker looks nearly identical to my old one  aside from a few minor color differences and the obvious fact that it is MUCH bigger  The top of the speaker has the power button and the bluetooth sync button  On the front  non mesh part of the speaker are the   and   buttons for the volume  Then  down at the very bottom   ON the bottom  lies the flip up waterproofing rubber flap  You have to pull this up in order to get to the USB charge port and Power LED charge indicators  This flap was a little tighter to pull up than I would have liked  I thought I was going to rip it once     and you definitely have to pull it back a bit with some force in order to plug the charge cable into it  The only other negative to this is given the fact that all this is on the bottom of the speaker  you have the lay it down on it s side while it is charging  Again  the same as my old one  But   you know  round things   well  they roll  Aside from this  I absolutely love the tall  cylinder shape of the speaker and the minimal amount of space it takes App Once I got the speaker fully charged  I was able to connect it via Bluetooth to my iPad Pro 10 5   my primary Twitch tv watching device  without fail  I downloaded the app designed for the BLAST range of speakers  It looks really nice and has all the normal options I d expect  The app detected the speaker and after I entered my WiFi password  it even automatically updated the firmware  It then asked me to activate Alexa and log into my Amazon account  which I was able to do without any problems   then gave me a code for a few months free of Amazon Music  I use Spotify myself  but still   not a bad gesture  After the inital setup  the app displays the current battery level in a bar style format  not a percentage   confimration of WiFi connection and Alexa on  off  as well as the link to my Amazon account  Other than that  it s pretty basic  but gives you the information you need However  my major issue with the battery level on this speaker is that you can ONLY view it through the app  My old BOOM speaker displayed the battery at the top of my device  as well as in my Battery Widget  This speaker does neither  It just shows that  headphone  icon at the top of my device with no battery indicator and does not appear anywhere in my Batteries info in settings or the Widget  I m hoping this is just a software bug and will be fixed in a later update  as it s quite annoying coming from my BOOM speaker that does show this  Then again  it could be intentional since you can just ask Alexa  what s my battery at?    Bluetooth  Alexa  Sound I m tying these final three into one category because it s seems that they are all somehow related together and where my biggest concerns are  This is where the the bugs and inconsistencies hide  aside from my issue with the Battery indicator above  The bluetooth has EXCELLENT range  but it doesn t appear to be flawless  like I m used to with other Ultimate Ear products  When it has a connection  it s great and solid  No cut outs or any other weird sound artifacts  However  I ve had a few instances where the bluetooth connection would just drop for no reason  This seemed a little inconsistent  with no rhyme or reason for it  Completely random  I have to manually go into settings and select the MEGABLAST speaker to connect it again This is my first Alexa enabled device  So  I was definitly excited to give it a try  Initially  Alexa was a joy to use  I started with all the obvious stuff you would ask something like Alexa or Siri   How s the weather today?  granted me exactly what I wanted to hear  plus more in a voice that I found rather pleasing compared to say  Siri  Alexa just seems much more natural and non robotic  Then I go on with having her tell me a joke  rap  etc  etc  All works great  But   I discovered an issue with using Alexa while playing music or any audio already coming through the speaker  When the speaker is playing audio and you issue an Alexa command   when she s done   the bluetooth connection just         DROPS  Every  Single  Time  I have to go into settings and reconnect  So  the only time I can use Alexa is when the speaker isn t being used  Which then  I ve more than likely got it turned of  Very disheartening as I really wanted to implement Alexa into my music  smart thermostat  etc  I m really hoping this is just a bug and can  will be fixed in a sooner than later firmware update As for sound  I found a lot of inconsistencies there as well  When playing music or other audio  I noticed I had to turn this speaker up louder than my BOOM to get the same level of volume out of it  I have to use my MEGABLAST at about half volume to get it at the same sound level as 1  3 volume of my BOOM  Which is weird because   isn t this supposed to be the loudest speaker they offer? It appears this speaker does better at mid to higher level volumes than lower to mid level  I initially thought that the  max  volume of the speaker was independant of the volume I have on my device because I could say  Alexa  change the volume to 10  and the volume bar on my device would stay the same  but the speaker would be much louder  But then   when I raise or lower the volume a notch on the device  the speaker volume would change to match that  Another issue I noticed   the speaker outputs the audio that is being played   but none of my other device sounds  Unlike my boom  I don t can t hear the keyboard typing sound  any text or e mail notification sounds  etc  I ve even turned the  Sounds  volume on my device up to the max with no results  But the audio being played is normal  I cannot figure this out to save my life I didn t get to test the bluetooth phonecall quality during use because my BRAND NEW iPhone X that I ve had for less than 15 days decided to bite the dust on me  the touch screen quit working   hardware defect  and I m currently awaiting a replacement from my carrier Conclusion So  there you have it  So far  I have a love  hate relationship with this speaker  The volume inconsistencies are killing me and Alexa is all but useless since my bluetooth connection drops every time I use her  I also really with there was a battery level displayed on the device like my BOOM has  but the only way to see it with the MEGABOOM is via the app  These are my big 3 issues with the speaker and why I m giving it a 4 out of 5 stars  The only thing saving it from 3 stars is the amazing sound of the actual audio that is being played   as long as it s above half  5  on the volume level Now  I did reach out to Logitech  the manufacturer of the Ultimate Ears brand  on Twitter earlier in the week  Several days have passed since then  which is why I waited a bit on my review  and I haven t heard anything back from them  I ll e mail support about this I guess  when I get my phone back  But I really expected some sort of response or follow up from them regarding this  Oh well  I should dock a star for this  but I won t 
More flexible than other headsets I looked at in syncing with multiple devices 
hubby needed to replace speakers and they are good so far
Would recommend speakers  Excellent sound and easy to install 
Speakers provide great sound wheather you want good bass or treble 
The two speakers was a great addition to our Sony television and sound bar with subwoofer 
The headphones sound really good  and connection via bluetooth is always reliable  I have kind of a big head  and they do tend to pinch  But it s not horrible 
Nice  I m picky  and these sounded great in my little MG in a small speaker box behind the seats 
I own a beat headset and Boss each have sound good but the JBL it s in a different class
Work well for door speakers to go along with my Kenwood stereo  Sound great and crisp clean sound
Like the clean sound and the price was great  It did not take long for install 
Setting up this  smart TV  took an hour and now the sound fluctuates and sometimes goes out completely  I find I have to press rewind and play to watch with sound and it is very annoying  I am thinking I must consider how to bring it back to the store or call and find out what the appropriate steps to take but I have not had time and I will be out of state for a while so this is very inconvenient 
These speakers fit behind the factory grilles in my car where others don t  The height from the mounting surface to the front of the speaker    tweeter is only 3  8 per the diagram on the box   other speakers can be much taller  Now installed  they sound very fine in the rear deck and  for a 6 5 speaker  the bass is more than what I expected  I ve attached the dimension diagram from the box  not found in the manual  
The Ultimate Ears is just that  Ultimate  I am overly please with 85% of the product  The sound is amazing for the size  I can fill the living room  or kitchen with beautiful and clear music  The size is perfect and the charging base is a must accessory  the design is perfect and usable  Now  Alexa  she is awesome  simple as that  I am a Google Home consumer  and Google Home is better in many ways  but Alexa  she is better in other ways  Alexa is smart and funny  she knows what I want to hear but is way to politically correct  Major issue is the device is not supported with Sirius XM accounts  this just blows my mind Pros SoundAlexa Integration Great MicrophoneAlexa AppsHome ControlHelps keep kids happy with fun gamesLong Lasting BatteryGreat LooksEasy SetupCons Missing Home Control with Major CompaniesSirius XM is not supported with this device  this is a big one for meAll in all  a solid 4 5 stars and would be a great gift for Christmas 
Best sound quality i ever experienced  i compared these to Bose audio  But one thing after only having these for one month the headphone stareted to show signs of major ware  my wife uses these lightly and she never dropped and they have 3 small cracks a long the left band  I give these only one more week and they will snap  Owned less than a month wow 
JBL has done it again  Love these headphones      
The speakers are easy to install and they sound great and came with easy to follow instructions
Awkward controls  Touch screen is too often activated inadvertently and changes channels or devices  Charging cradle and not having to mess with batteries is a plus  Not worth the money in my opinion 
Love the programability  Hate the delay in the touchscreen entry  It really made the remote unusable for me  I am so used to the instant response of a regular button type of remote  the Harmony 700   that I just couldn t adjust  And I couldn t send it back quick enough  I replaced it with the Harmony Smart Control with simple remote  So I still get the wonderful programability  without the touch screen woes 
It works and it handles everything that cable box has 
Sony is awesome and so is this speaker  If your looking for big big boom this isn t for you  If you want clear sound with excellent resolution this is for you 
This blu tooth speaker is awesome I need an other one
Despite its best efforts to scare me off  I actually do like this speaker a lot  Unboxing the speaker two things immediately struck me  First  the speaker is smaller than I d thought it would be based on the box  lots of packing materials to keep it safe   Second  the speaker feels surprisingly heavy given its size  It only weighs a little more than 2 pounds according to my kitchen scale  but it feels a lot heavier than that when you re holding it in your hand  I got the speaker in blue  one of my favorite colors   The blue is a duskier shade than I was expecting  but it s still pleasing to the eye  That being said  I do regret not having picked this up in black as it would have coordinated with my furniture better  The texture is lightly rubberized and purports to be water resistant  The front of the speaker bears an LED light ring that can be customized to hit a range of different colors  All of the speaker s ports are hidden behind a door on the back right hand side  It came with a great big notice taped to it advising you to make sure that the door is shut when the unit is in use  I can only presume that this is to ensure the unit s water resistance as it seems to operate perfectly fine with the door wide open  A surprising addition to the ports is a traditional USB type A port  It should be noted that this port is for power output only and does not support power input or data transfer  The documentation says that the port is included to charge one s phone or tablet using the speaker  This is a nice addition  but it feels a little random to me  Turning it on proved to be the first stumbling block for this review  Following the instructions  I charged the device for four hours prior to attempting to use it  With the speaker still plugged into the wall  I pressed the power button       and nothing happened  I tried pressing it several times and got no response whatsoever  I worried that I might have received a defective unit  but unplugging the device from the wall and pressing the power button finally yielded results with the device promptly turning on  Oddly  this was the only time that I encountered this issue  I have since left it plugged in and pressed the power button  and it turns on right away  Charging proved to be another oddity with this device  Using it for about two hours  I was down to 75% battery according to the phone app that goes with this speaker  With the speaker still on  I plugged it in to see about charging it while using it  An hour later  the app still reported a battery status of 75%  I m not sure whether this is a characteristic of the device itself or a glitch with the phone app  Pairing the device was simple enough on an android phone  I did have to turn my Bluetooth on and off to get it to show up  but I suspect that was the result of a bug on my phone and not with this speaker  The app that works with this speaker is a little too generic and lacks polish  This is where things start to go downhill  First  the big selling point for this speaker is its ability to wirelessly pair up and synchronize with other speakers from this series to create a stereo or surround sound effect  I couldn t test this as I only had a single speaker to work with  Sony really ought to consider selling these in multi packs if they re going to make such a big deal of this capability  I knew from my own research prior to getting this speaker that this capability only works with other speakers from this series  You can t use other bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers or even other models of Sony speakers to do this  That being said  the language in the app is very vague and makes it sound like you can grab any old bluetooth speaker to create a wireless speaker network  Curious to see if this was actually the case  I grabbed a pair of bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers and attempted to pair them  Sadly  as expected  neither one of them would pair  Second  the app s control of the customizable LED light ring isn t quite what I was led to believe given the packaging and documentation  My hope was to use this speaker with my home theater system and have it paired with my home theater PC rather than a phone or tablet  Given the speaker s ability to link up with other speakers  I d had thoughts about maybe using this to eventually implement a wireless surround sound and  or whole home speaker system  My PC setup has a nice blue LED lighting effect  and I thought it would be cool to get the LED ring on the speaker to match the blue that the rest of my setup has  That s when I discovered the second shortcoming of the app  You can t select a single color for the LED ring to glow  The app only gives you a list of preset color schemes that you can choose to have it cycle through  You can t select just a single color and tell the speaker to hold it continuously  special PSA on the lighting  if you re epileptic  don t attempt to use this speaker until you adjust the color settings  By default  this speaker came in  RAVE  mode which has white flashing strobes along the left and right edges  There was no mention of this strobe effect in any of the materials I read prior to getting this speaker  and it s a little disturbing that this was enabled by default   Third  the voice control button within the app doesn t appear to actually do anything  Pressing it prompts you to say a keyword  I tried saying  Sony    Speaker    Hey you   and  Play Queen s  Bohemian Rhapsody    but I had no luck getting the app or speaker to react  Pressing the help button within the app didn t lead me to anything offering any support for this  Saying  Google  did pull up a screen with icons for Google Music and Youtube  but I couldn t get the app to do anything beyond that point using voice controls  Unfortunately  the shortcomings aren t limited to just the app  The speaker also has a button on the top for bass boost  Upon first using the speaker  I was very impressed by the sound  It was clear and loud with a lot of punch to it  Curious to see what it would sound like with even more bass  I pressed the bass button on the top       and the sound immediately went flat and tinny  Apparently  the bass button was already enabled by default  Given the way that this is set up  the bass button is less of a boost button and more of a  make my music sound anemic and bad  button  The perception would have been much improved had they not opted to have this enabled by default  Using the speaker on a phone call yielded mixed results  The audio came over both loud and crystal clear on my end  That being said  the person on the other line said that my voice was distant and full of distortion  Suffice it to say  that speaker s microphone isn t very good  A couple of warnings if you re going to try and use this as a speaker on a PC  First  you won t be able to control the speaker s settings from the PC  You re going to have to use the phone app to control things like power management and the LED lighting  Secondly  you re going to want to go into the power management options within the app to turn off the auto off power saving feature  This feature is enabled by default  The speaker doesn t automatically wake after powering down  If you don t turn off the auto off  then you will be forced to press the power button on the speaker to turn it back on after it powers down  The amazing thing is that despite the shortcomings that I ve listed  I still really like this speaker  The LED lighting is fun  the sound is terrific with lots of volume and bass  and the aesthetic is nice and clean  Is the speaker perfect? No  Is the speaker really good? Yes  Despite the shortcomings  I m still seriously considering buying another one to use in my home theater setup  I would recommend this product 
This Sony wireless speaker is one of the best that I ve heard and all my friends are amazed at the sound that they put out the flashing lights are ok to
This speaker is amazing  The sound is crisp  the bass is loud  I enjoy every moment of this Speaker and the lights are bright as well  The sickest think about this Speaker is the fact that you can add other speakers and have like a surround sound going 
Good quality  Sounds great  I came in a huge box  But it s a nice size for my living room 
I love Sony  this is just another one of their great products 
My niece loves this speaker  Easy to connect to a device  good quality 
I purchases this Sony bluetooth speaker to partner with the Amazon Dot  I always have enjoyed Sony speakers and while this was a bit more money than what I preferred to spend  the sound quality  size and ease of use made it worth the extra money 
This product is pretty amazing  I use the speaker everyday whether I m cleaning or lying in my bed  I would definitely recommend getting one and also a second one for the surround sound feel 
The quality and volume of sound that comes from such a small speaker is great  Sony never fails me with the quality of their electronics 
Tried a few others  but this brand works best with my Sony Camcorder  Prices are about the same  so why not stay with the Sony brand?
It all works great but the only thing I don t like is when I play music though my laptop the lights on the speakers don t flash to the beat  They just all lite up and down at the same time but not to the beat of the music  Radio and CD s  the lights work great 
After many past models they have put themselves ahead of the competition as far as sound for the money is concerned  XB20  looks like the beats pill but sounds way better  also sounds better than the bose mini  color   100 starting if on budget  but it sure won t look or sound that way  XB30  Sounds better than Bose Soundlink 3  also the the new Bose that looks like a cone  superior sound the the JBL because I get a more accurate stereo sound and is superior the the Harmon  Kardon Onyx  strange design is not portable  placement can be annoying  battery is junk and interface is horrible  At  150 this is the best bang for your buck  XB40  sounds like a true hifi stereo due to separation  large accurate acoustics  amazing mids  deeper bass  can be tamed using app if desired   it is the largest out of the 3 but is still very portable   250 sound for pool parties and large gatherings  All 3 speakers can fit in a backpack  seem to be tailored for a wide range of customers and settings can be made  saved on device utilizing Sony app  Fairly user friendly using iPhone or Andriod  I ve purchased and returned many Bluetooth brands to Best Buy and this time I m very happy  Sony got everything right about this speaker  rounded product that will age well Makes a great gift 
Sony did not let me down as usual  Sounds great and has all the options I was looking for 
Works as expected and the quality is clear  Kind of expense for what you get and is cheaper per tape the more you purchase 
Wow  What a great sound comes out of this speaker  Whether we use it in the house to listen to our favorite tunes or out by the pool  this speaker has great sound qualify 
Great battery life and sound  Easy to carry and take with you anywhere
This is a great unit for the price works well and plays great  Lights on front are beautiful  Would have gave 5 stars but you have to open the back plate a pull open type to charge and use direct power  Would have made more sense to have charge port on the back for better access  other than that best unit I ever owned 
i just bought this blue tooth Sony h ear go speaker and it is awesome  sounds really great  loud and different settings  
Since I ve gotten a Sony camera reccently I thoguht it would be best to be all Sony for my camera needs  Though the rest in the store looked about the same price  I really would of liked it to be lower   then again I d like if if the price on everything would be lower   but they record amazingly  The median of your film capture is also another factor of how good your footage will be just keep that in mind 
Very nice radio for the price  Love the blue tooth  Son loves the radio
I have a Slingbox 350  which I like very much and the results are stunning and the player experience without issues  For some reason the company decided to change the way the interfaced worked for the M2 and I am not as satisfied with the result  All in all it works  but not as well as the Model 350 
Decidedly meh  Screen refresh time is slow  and animations are slow  Honestly less intuitive button layout usage than the simpler models  Happy with the battery life at least  so there s that  Gets the job done  but I wouldn t recommend it 
Overall a good remote however can get very frustrating
After several pairs of higher quality headphones and having to return them because they fried out during charging from other brands I was seriously impressed from JBL and will only buy from JBL for all future headphone needs
There s some good and some bad about this device The good is that it is really easy to configure for even a fairly complicated setup  It s also easy to teach it new remote codes if their database is incomplete  I had to do this and it worked great  It also *usually* manages to power on and properly set up all devices  although there is some flakiness about that that I have yet to get to the bottom of The bad is that it feels bad in the hand and the controls are inconveniently located  It is too light and flimsy feeling  the shape feels awkward and the weight of it seems unbalanced  the texture of the back feels uncomfortable  and you have to operate it two handed to reach many of the controls I wish they d put the same functionality into a redesigned package 
Great especially when there is no place to plug in  Always have reserve on hand  Self contained cord and small size are a real plus 
This product solves plenty of issues  the best one being you can hide the 3 4 other product controllers you own and just use this one  Also  it saves on spousal arguments in continually explaining which controller controls which function or activity you choose for entertainment  One stop shopping 
Purchased this product to mount my new Panasonic 65 plasma TV   model TCP65GT50  Wanted a fully articulating mount so I could move it easily to adjust viewing angle as well as access connections on back of the TV  and also wanted a slim profile so it would sit as close to the wall as possible when fully retracted  This mount does all of these things well  I was originally looking at the VLF311 which appeared very similar to the VLF410 except the VLF311 only accomodates TVs up to 65 and costs less  so I emailed Sanus asking about the difference and one of the reps immediately replied and asked that I call him so he could explain  He told me that the VLF410 is the  second generation  of the VLF311 and offers improved balancing of large TVs  This made sense because I did recall seeing a few customer reviews of the VLF311 saying that their TVs wouldn t hang perfectly level  Of course  this begs the question of why they are still selling the VLF311 when they have admitted it needed to be updated  Anyway  I needed to mount my TV centered between two windows  but the two 16 studs I had to use were exactly four inches off center of where the mount neeeded to be hung  Since the VLF411 has multiple pre drilled slots which are designed to accomodate studs between 14 and 22 apart  I was able to use two unmatching slots to compensate for three of those four inches but this still left me with the mount being one inch off center between my two windows  To get that last inch  I hung the TV on the mount and then simply slid the TV one inch to the left so it was hanging one inch off center of the mount  but perfectly centered between my two windows  Problem solved No  the 86 lb  TV would ever so slightly tilt to the left since it was hanging off center  So much for 2nd generation improvement of the mount  It still has very little tolerance for TVs not hanging perfectly centered  Undeterred  and deciding that the TV was hanging about 6 lower than where I really wanted it  I started over and installed the mount 6 higher and INTENTIONALLY a bit off level to the right  so when I reinstalled the TV one inch to the left of center on the mount  it hung perfectly  Bottom line    the multiple pre drilled mounting slots give you some flexibility to accomodate  off center  studs  but if you need more than 3 or 4 inches of wiggle room then be prepared to take more creative action 
Transfer from other  older Logitech remote was straight forward  Very easy to use universal remote 
perfect tv for my gaming room  some people commented about the apps not working  but all of mine work just fine  super convenient  the speakers arent anything impressive but no built in speakers are  the footings are the same as pictured   some people said theirs were different  overall the tv is solid and im stoked about it  great color quality and lots of personalization with the video quality  i will be buying more for sure 
I�ve have always purchased Samsung TVs due to their mix of quality and price 
The instal was simple  they sound great and the price was right 
Great sound for the size  price  Chromecast built works great and was the main reason for purchase  Nice alternative to more expensive systems like Sonos  May purchase another to create stereo setup 
I really like the sound quality that these produce  They also easily pair with Apple devices  Frame seems a little flimsy so probably not for the user who will take them everywhere and put them through a lot of wear and tear  I use my for studying online and watching videos 
This set really packs some punch for this price point  Easily fills the room with sound and the bass  although capable of distorting if you push it too much  is very satisfying 
After losing several WD green drives in a heavy read  write situation  I switched to the Red drive and have had no problems at all  I have 50  of these in varying sizes in service  I ordered several from another retailer and 3 came DOA  I ve never had that problem from CDW  Every drive has been fine Yes  the Red server class drives are more expensive  but they are worth the little expense in reliability 
Fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it  Slightly less intuitive than my previous Harmony 900 series  Less buttons more  touch menu  and activity intensive  Programming from my old discontinued remote transferred using the Harmony Website  I do like the volume and play  pause  fwd options 
Perfect for the job we needed  Didn�t need a fancy screen  just a radio that played XM Radio  Perfect
Well built  and solid on the wall  Doesn t always slide easily to extend from the wall to turn  but weight of 65  TV is a factor  Overall very good product 
This is a good product for the price  Volume is a little low but okay for a desk position 
Purchased to replace my 2012 UE Boombox  Spearker  Box has a lot of volume and purchased it to listen to music around the house and audio books in the car  got tired of the car  road drowning out my phone and don t have a connection to my car speakers   The volume is synced with the latest update for iPhone where the volume on the phone matches the speaker  first time I have experienced that with a speaker  making it so you don t have to get up and adjust the volume on the speaker when it is set too low  might not work on all devices  did not work for my iPhone5 that I use as an iPod   haven t updated in a while   The construction is high quality and feels solid  well built  It has a line in for audio jack and a  function  button to switch between Bluetooth  wireless  and line in  Not an audiophile  but I think it sounds crisper than the Bose SoundLink mini II and III and had comparable volume  battery life and size  but smaller and seemed just as good as the bigger SoundLink III   Also checked out the Sony Srs x77 and x88  which do not have usb charging connections or portable size  The x77  not the new model  zr7  which has yet to be released as of 5  2  2016  also shuffled around the display at the store and thought it would fall off the table  The x88 does not have an internal battery  but performed better than comparable  higher priced sound bars  Love the size  volume and clarity I get from the box and can recommend it 
Easy to add your component models and  poof  you are ready to go  Customizing steps wasn t as easy  Some of the component activities were not in the drop down list  The unit recharges quickly 
Great sound and I love the fact I can listen to a video and my wife is undisturbed next to me while sleeping  I wake at night which is why I bought these  noise cancellation  I have owned many headsets  I looked at some really expensive ones   450 and up and chose these for the complete package  Wireless  noice cancellation  and a solid JBL sound  Great headset 
Super sound  Great fit  Def a good buy  Pairing with my device was easy 
I used mine in a cover patio  The bass fill the space nicely  Best sounding speakers for the money 
I needed a mount with full motion that sits flush to the wall for my 55 LCDThis is solidly constructed  Very easy to install and full swivel capability  Has guides that help run the wires in a clean hidden way The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because it only comes with two screw widths by which to attach the TV to the mount  I had to use the wider  longer  screw to mount the television which resulted in the TV extending a good 1 5 additional inches from the wall otherwise it was have sat really flat on the wall  Still looks  works great 
I use my Surface Pro 4 mostly in tablet mode  but not because there is anything wrong with this keyboard  I have no complaints about this keyboard  The keys are responsive  and substantial feeling  I appreciate the addition of the fingerprint scanner as well 
Keyboard is solid and works great  Love that it s the cover too 
Best quality headphones in the market  Expensive but worth the money 
But after purchasing and trying to switch my  Sirius  programs to this receiver I m told it s actually a XM receiver and to get certain channels like NFL radio I needed to upgrade my programming to everything so in other words you have to buy both Sirius and XM programs not just one or the other even though it s all the same company now  If this is not an issue for you than it s a pretty good buy it comes with everything you need for vehicle installation no further purchases needed 
I was very excited to get this NC Bluetooth headphones  the sound and the Noise canceling are awesome  However  after 4 days of use  the headphones suddenly stopped and became unresponsive that I had to wait 8 10 hours for it to die down and charge it back again Right after  it worked normally for a short time and it did the same thing again I thought that this is a rare case of a defect  Went to Best Buy to exchange it  because this NC  Wireless and how it sounds blew away other headphones  However  after 8 days of use of the new headphone  it started to have the same problem again  went back to exchange it and same thing happened Ultimately  got my refund back and won t buy it until JBL would fix this headphones software 
My grandson who put these in his Dell XPS 8900 says there s no appreciable gain in speed and in fact a decided uptick in latency  whatever that is   He had two 8gb ddr4 chips and one died already so he wanted to replace them with these four PNY Anarchy chips to maintain his 16gb level or Ram  He says in fairness that part of the problem may be Dell s use of GTX 730 discrete graphics  something to do with response times I believe he said  instead of a better choice and trying to build a gaming computer pairing that particular GTX 730 with this brand new processor  He s replacing the graphics and said he d let me know if it shows any improvements in ram performance  He said that benchmarking the DDR4 s tho didn t really show much difference in performance with equivalent DDR3 chips None of that means anything to me at all but he is a dedicated gamer and knows his systems  He said he d give them about three stars on a five star scale so I m carrying it over into my review because he knows his stuff  He also said who d use 4GB s in this day and age when a gamer would take a four slot board to 32 GBs of ram instead So for whatever it s worth there s my review  I hope it means something to you and helps you decide because this time I was decidedly out of my depth 
With this product I feel like it only speaks to Apple Car Play considering there s only 3 functions which are CarPlay  radio  and aux  it s incredibly basic for a touchscreen which is why I gave it 3 stars  There s just not much to it at all but it works and does the basics if that s all you re looking for 
same great sound  but the XB30 has SO MUCH longer battery life  there is no comparison 
Bought this on Black Friday and it was delivered and set up by Sunday evening  I love the size  40 inch is perfect for my space  which is large without being overwhelming  The clarity and color are awesome  I had no idea that it was possible to get so much TV for so little money  The stand was the one in the picture  very stable  No problem at all attaching it to my sound system and hard drives  for movies   I ve had many Samsung products over the years and have always been happy with them 
This television is great reminds me of old tube tvs how they would turn on and of the screen would like close the picture vs just turn off  The audio  visual on samsung is amazing  I love the intuitive interface and ability to stream  Picks up Cable like a dream without a box  The settings menu is loaded for you control  customization freaks out there  Samsung does a great job of making everything easy and locateable  Beautiful and sleek  Couldnt beat the price either 
Love it  Simple to use  it s so nice only to use one remote instead of three It also has connections to charge your phone  computers  etc 
Clumsy set up  Could be auto set up  never loaded without going on line
I ve wall mounted this to an interior bedroom wall with regular 2x4  drywall construction  While somewhat bulky for one person  I managed to install it by myself  It functions as advertised  and everything seems to be working quite well  Articulation is smooth  and post mount corrections of the tv alignment were trivial  The television is a 50 Samsung LED Smart TV  I recommend this mount  while I actually purchased it from Best Buy   Be sure to mount as directed on studs  A helpful full size template was provided for installation planning 
I ve started replacing all of my current NAS HD s w   WD Red s and to date all continue to run with no issues 
So far so good  Took 2 3 people to install because it s heavy  but it s heavy for a reason  durability   Would recommend 
I got this to Replace a drive that went bad in a array so i read the the red is meant to be used in array
Like it  Wish I could get everything synced up  Tried the yoga but only got a bunch of static  Don�t know how to trouble shoot 
Our first one lost blue tooth connectivity at about a year  We bought the same one because it provides good sound from my husband s iPhone 
Easy to install wires are clearly marked  It also fit in existing water resistant boat shield  On the boat in the sun you can clearly see the display  Radio channels come in very clear  Very pleased with this unit  It strongly pushes the two 6 5 cone speakers on boat exceptional sound quality I will update the review once I have taken it out on the water more and can talk about it s durability 
so far I have not had any issues with them and works great
So far the tv has lived up to expectations  Nice buy 
So far ok  The only way to update it is with a desktop computer wired to a router  Kind of a pain that way 
I have not been able to get video over my wireless connection but can hear audio just fine  Not sure if it might be an issue with the fios cable box emitting the video correctly 
I almost returned it because when I put in my zip code  my TV service provider was not listed and I could not program favorite channels  However  after exploring further I discovered you should try other zip codes in your area and I eventually did find my provider  I have now had all my other remotes in a drawer for several weeks 
This Harmony remote is absolutely incredible  Easy to set up  and easier to use  Get one immediately 
I discontinued my internet provider and use this  Wonderful
I ve had harmony remotes for years and they continue to improve  The new software is easier to set up the remotes  The screen is nice and bright and you can swipe between different screens  Love it  
Works perfectly with my 2010 Mac mini  the Mhz is perfectly capable  also 8gb is the maximum the 2010 model will handle  and this is the exact amount you will need 
My son had a mid 2010 macpro laptop and was complaining about being sluggish  Quick look at Apple support showed how to upgrade Ram from existing 2gb to 4gb  took literally 5 min after finding the ram modules at Best Buy    he can actually run a couple of applications at the same time now  This should hold him until he can actually spring for a iMac desk top with 16gb ram 
I got a great deal on this Dell XPS  Runs very fast and very quite  With Win 10 set up was a breeze and up and running in no time 
I am looking for a 32 TV for my 95 year old Mother  She prefers one with a sleep timer  I have not found one available  I am disheartened to see the review for the 32 Samsung that indicates smart function problems  I would like to buy a Samsung  as I currently have 3 Models that work well  I would like to know that they have repaired the Smart TV problem before committing to their 2017 32 model  Is there any way to find out or be alerted that the the problem has been fixed I have the 2015 32 model with Apple TV  Roku outboard devices  It too does not function as advertised by the manufacturer  But the picture is exceptional  It seems that Samsung has not put their technology to bare on this problem  though they continue to promote the feature  Also  I was surprised to find the latest Samsung TV that I purchased was manufactured in Mexico  It dos not seem to be of the same quality as the previous models that I have purchased  Has anyone found that it is also the case for them
Reviewed several remotes and ultimately decided on this one  I m a gadget guy and I think the touch screen was my deciding factor  This is a great remote once you understand how it really works and get it set up correctly  I never have a problem with it unless my 8 year old manually turns things on  off  The trick to the remote is to use it and only it to control your devices  otherwise it gets confused and becomes a headache 
I don t like the requirements you have to sign to use the TV due to the  smart features  that I didn t even want  they didn t offer any without the smartness for the same size and price   But other than that I love this tv  It s easy to use and has really good color and brightness  All my PS4 games look really vibrant 
Honestly  this remote is pretty great  Some argue about how the play  pause buttons are at the top but I had no issue using it that way  Besides  most of what I tried let s me use the Ok and directional buttons as play  pause  fastforward  rewind  The touch screen is pretty responsive and there isn t much delay accessing your devices or activities  What sucks is that there is a limitation of 15 device no matter if you add more of these remotes or add a hub  you ll get the maximum amount from the device that has the maximum limit  I wish the 8 device limit from my harmony hub combined with this harmony remote giving me a total of 23 devices  But nope Logitech just wants you to buy one of the expensive remotes to have the 15 limit  Even the Elite has a maximum of 15  So the maximum you could get from the most expensive remote is also 15  They should have at least doubled that as they did with the 8 limits Before I begin  I would like to say this is my first time owning a smart universal remote  I had one or two or so cheap universal remotes before  So this is a bigger difference Battery  Charge it for four hours  Use it for about 72 hours  Plenty of time to use this imo  Just leave it on charge when you sleep and you ll be good to go throughout the day  It has a charging indicator on the screen that let s you know when charging and fully charged  There is a battery life indicator on the top right of the screen when the remote is out of lock screen  You can charge this two ways  It has a cradle but you can also use the micro USB port below the remote to charge it up   The micro USB port is mostly just there to setup the remote through PC but you can charge it through micro USB port as well  Design  The remote looks beauitful  Though  it could have been better  I do agree with people that the play  pause  fastforward  rewind buttons should have been at the bottom  But honestly that isn t an issue as most of the stuff I ve tried lets you use the directional and ok button as play  pause  fastforward  rewind  But either way it s pretty easy to use and feels nice in the hands  I love having a remote that has both a touchscreen and physical buttons  Touchscreen adds more functionality and having physical buttons just feels better pressing on them  Number keys would have been nice but really not needed if you have ditched cable and don t plan on having an antenna  And it doesn t take much effort looking at the touchscreen when entering the numbers  I know some people don t like that but at least it s just 9 numbers and not an entire alphabet    Interface  Not much could be done with an interface when the screen is small  It s nice for a universal remote  much better than what smart universal remotes had before   You can change the background from a preset or upload your own through the computer  Overall  it s pretty easy to use and really no delay from going device to device Touch screen  Like I mentioned before  the touch screen is pretty responsive  If you don t want to accidentally touch the touch screen  it s best to put the lock screen  So you can just swipe the lock screen when you want to use it and you don t accidentally end up pressing any of the touchscreen buttons when you meant to touch the physical buttons etc Customization  You can arrange the order of devices  For example if you want TV all the way at top you can drag it to all the way at the top when you are in edit mode  Same with activities  What you can t arrange is Smart Home devices that are in the Plug  Lights folders  You can arrange where Plugs and Lights go but not the devices themselves in the Plugs and Lights folder  Kinda sucks as you can do that with the Harmony app but not on the remote  Also  the arrangement you set in the Harmony app doesn t get applied to the remote  You have to do the arrangement separately on both the app and remote  Also as I said before you can also change the background image to a selection from the preset or upload your own through the computer  Customization is great but could be better  At least it s there    Activities  Favorites  You setup activities which lets you can turn on multiple things at once  You can also for example access your favorite channels or if you have a Roku your favorite apps  It seems like there is only integration with Roku when it comes to Alexa and Favorites section  So for example you can launch Netflix from the Netflix icon in the favorite sections once you hit the Roku activity Limitations  It kind of sucks that there is a device limitation of 15 devices only  I m sure they could have gone with a much higher limit  I have a IR RF Hub called Broadlink RM Pro that doesn t have this kind of annoying limit and it s much cheaper than this remote and harmony hub  It s only under 40 and that s when it s not on sale  I also wish they would have let us combined devices in order to increase our limits such as if you have the harmony hub which carries only 8 devices you ll have 8   15 from this harmony remote giving you a total device limit of 23  The nice thing though is there does not seem to be a limit of devices you can setup for SmatHome such as if you have SmartThings linked  you can pretty much put as many devices as you like Price  It s a pretty expensive remote  It s hard to put 200 on this remote  I guess if I paid 200 for this remote  I would have rated this differently  But since I got this during the holidays for 100  it s a much better experience to me just because of that Support  Logitech has email  live chat and phone support  So you have many options to chat with them  And they usually respond back and take care of your problems pretty well Overall  I would recommend this product when it s on sale for 100 or less  As 200 is too much to ask for  I like this over using a smartphone as a remote because it s nice having a device that is dedicated as a remote only and nothing else  Smartphones have too much going for it and the lack of physical buttons don t make it as nicer to use as a dedicated remote  Even if you voice control for everything  Echo  Google Home   using a remote is sometimes nicer  I prefer changing the volume through remote rather then through Alexa but I prefer turning on the TV through Alexa through anything else  The amount of customization is nice but could be better  Having the ability to charge the remote two ways  Micro USB and cradle  is also nice  The remote has a nice design  feels good in the hands but the device limitations are for the most part the weakest point  I could get away with the other issues as they aren t such big issues but I would have loved to control more devices without having to find workarounds  Overall  I would recommend this remote only when it s 100 or less  I can t see myself putting 200 for any remote   But who knows maybe I will 
This Smart TV is very unique and smart The Samsung Smart TV requires reading and understanding of the functionalities Once this is mastered your are on your way to enjoying your TV The 108 p is the way to go for a clearer picture 
I had an older version that stopped working  I use it to control several components  This upgraded model is easier to use 
I m a fan of deep bass  so if you are a fan of a lot of bass you will like this bluetooth speaker 
For a small speaker they have great sound and hooking them up is so easy if you have little room for placement they are great for that   Being Bose I wouldn t expect anything less
Purchased this Sony product as a gift  Best bluetooth speaker I tested at Best Buy for the price  quality  sound  and features  Easy to set up and connects to multiple devices 
I use this speaker outdoors in the garage   in the backyard by the pool   it more than does the job  Amazing sound  Very loud with great bass  I own 2 of these  Kicker rocks
The music coming out of this speaker makes you feel like you are in a club  The lights flash and the bass is so awesome  Can t get enough of this speaker  Went out and bought a second one and started a party chain 
Sony quality small package in a small box connects to all the Sony products 
Needed something small for travel and this works great 
Great small portable Bluetooth speaker  We use it everywhere in the house 
The Sony speaker is about as good as it get at this size and price point 
It s small but boy is it LOUD  I love it  for the size and convince of it  Goes great on top shelves and fills the room nicely  Really great 
The Boytone 2500w 2 1 ch home theatre system is powerful for its size  The highs are clear  and the lows are monotone and soothing 
Love it   I can bring it anywhere    sound is excellent
a really good speaker  ultra portable and has the best clarity of any speaker I ve ever owned  Its a little heavy though
This helped when phone was running low and not near any place to charge the phone 
Very  very slow and time consuming  While compact  too much of a hassle to use 
I am disappointed with my purchase of three of these remotes  I have an original Harmony One  that is now discontinued  and it works superbly  but the newer model has a much slower response time causing you to hold the remote at the components longer  Half the time  the remote is pulled away before it is done communicating with the components and the Help option must then be deployed to get the settings back in order  I ll go with the much cheaper versions in the future 
I was looking to replace my Harmony One with something more up to date and this was my choice  I chose this because of my One but this was a bad choice  First of all it was advertised as being able to control the PS3 and Xbox One via RF  This was not the case  The remote will not do RF at all  It is slow  feels clunky  and has HORRIBLE battery life  I was barely able to get 3 days out of a charge where my One can go for almost a month  Over all  to me  this is a huge step backwards from the Harmony One  Avoid this unless you have no other options 
I love my new slingbox  I never miss the Orioles  Ravens   I don t miss anything  Everyone should have one 
I love the SlingPlayer for situations in which a cable Jack isn t available where you need it  Plug up the SlingPlayer and use an apple tv on a remotely placed tv then you don t have to worry about that coax jack 
This is the only way to extend your cable tv subscription to a second home or to watch your favorite sports team while traveling  Bring your Chromecast along to pair it and you have a complete solution any time you are away from home  I use it with the sling app on my android and the Roku box  Unbelievable quality 
Have your home cable TV with you everywhere you go  Great product 
Couldn t get it to load Cox cisco 9865hdc  Also  couldnt get picture 
I got the slingbox for my brother because he wanted to be able to watch the Dodgers when away from home  He has TimeWarner Cable and can watch them at home  but when he is away he misses out  The Slingbox solves that problem beautifully  It was easy to set up and works great  We have recommended it to several friends 
I got the M2 so that I would have unlimited downloads for free  The M1 is pay as you go  The M2 along with their recommended HDMI  Composite Video splitter works great  The hardware is fairly low profile and set up was easy  The M2 has built in Wi Fi  but I opted to direct connect since I had a LAN port available  One thing to note is the location to set up  I set up in the mail family room  but I learned that when I access Slingbox from my android phone  it will take over the family room TV  I may move the M2 to my bedroom TV location so I don t impact the family room TV that could be in more use  Bottomline  if you want your TV  DVR programming available anywhere  Slingbox is the way to go 
I was looking for a solution to place shift channels received via our OTA antenna  This worked nicely  It is a compact box  easy to set up  and easy too control  There is no remote control because it doesn t need one  You control it via a web interface and the remote control of the box that is feeding into it via component inputs 
The Slingbox M2 works well but slowly  Switching stations does not always happen from the first input which is frustrating  I chose this one over the HDMI upgraded one because the HDMI coding sometimes restricts transmission of HDMI quality movies and programs  The clarity on the M2 works well with us 
I had the previous model  non WIFI  of the Slingbox and the Ethernet port stopped working  The M2 replacement is just awesome  Took me literally 2 minutes to install and it worked right out of the box  Only issue I have is with the Verizon box which does not allow 2 HDMI to connected do had to use component instead  Either way love the new product 
Less than 10 min to setup  Just login to Slingbox website to register and start watching with the app or online from anywhere  I traveled overseas to China where they restrict internet  tv but was able to use Slingbox and watch all my normal programs  Very small device and doesn t take up space 
Best technology ever created  I can watch whatever shows I want  when I want  and wherever I m at  No more missing those NFL games 
If you re on the road as much as I am  particularly if you travel overseas  the Slingbox is a god send  You can watch   control your own TV back at your house  from anywhere that has an internet connection  I ve been a user since the very first slingbox came out  and they just keep getting better  I bought this unit on sale  which made the deal even better 
This product was as ratites does everything you need it to do one thing I do not like is that you have to watch a add everytime you open up the free app for paying a 100 it should be included
2nd one I purchased  Saving a second cable bill I would pay for at my other place by using this device 
The M2 Slingbox is great  Easy to setup  Works like a charm whenever I need to watch TV away from home 
We have had Slingbox for years and the new one streams even better than the last  For those that travel    a must have 
Still had to purchase a component box to allow A side video stream to my remote TV  This is necessary with HDMI signals coming off cable box  Most everything has moved to HDMI connection so why not just build it in  This is a good reason to stay with the M2 and not a higher set from sling box 
Extremely satisfied with purchase  Fantastic tool to use when in the road
Sling Media   Slingbox M2 allows us to enjoy our favorite shows from home while we are on the road 
Picture is perfect and works as advertised  Used from different starts on cell data 
Positive Review Sling Box offers the ability to stream important live television viewership from your home box TV to your laptop or tablet The ability to view live TV anywhere in the world is truly amazing and given the strong bandwidth connection  the streaming is 100% percent operational  I ve personally tested this device from around the world and have had mix results but this was all due to poor network connections  not the actual Sling Box itself Basically  Sling Box is based on your network connections  if you are in a poor location with minimal strength while on a low bandwidth wireless connection  then you will lose the ability to stream 100% and will endure  hiccups  and possible re connections 
Watch TV anywhere  it s the best thing ever  Sling box anywhere and it s awesome 
I went into Best Buy expecting to get a JBL Charge 3 for my dad for father s day  I wanted to get a JBL because i knew they were waterproof and sounded great  but once a Best Buy employee let me open a Charge 3 and compare it to this XB30  I was amazed at the difference  This speaker sounds AMAZING  The only reason the employee let me hear this one is because he bought one for his father too  I m very glad he opened my eyes because i would have overlooked this great speaker  Thinking about buying one for myself now 
This remote looks good  obviously not as good as some of the previous models  but it ll do  Works as it should  The  Help  button isn t as easy to find as on my last Harmony  and I m not really a fan of the  hold for skip  double function of the ff button  Got it for a great price  though 
Very easy to setup this remote  I like the feature of setting favorite channels 
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it  Sound is great  lights are cool  nice size and seems durable  No complaints  
Great product  Christmas gift for my GF  We use xm everyday 
Very easy to install right out of the box  Great purchase for the starter kit for XM Radio 
I have not been able to get transferred correctly 
Since I bought this head set have new passion for Listening to music again  I have many Bluetooth headsets for my iPhone  but these big boy 40mm cans really sound great  The app that you can download takes control to a higher level  Top notch  bought them on sale and super happy 
no wonder why it s so expensive now  I bought it from JR Music and Computer World  via Amazon  a month ago for less then 150 including shipping  i made a huge research before i bought it  this mount is the best  it has a low profile and yet could be pulled out so you have access to the back of your TV 
This is awesome    Seriously
Simple lay out  Totally customizable  Bought one  after while gave set up to my folks  They love it  Bought this older simpler remote again because I love the button simplicity 
The JBL Elite 700 headphone are so amazing both in Bluetooth mode and running straight into you device  The JBL app enhances you sound with pre set EQ or the option to customize your sound  Bonus feature is that you can also customize your noise cancellation 
This product belongs to everyone that is using Surface  Should buy it 
Best earphones on the market  I upgraded from the Bose and what a difference 
works well 90% of the time  The touch screen is very sensitive and you have to be careful to touch the exact thing or it will send you to the wrong station 
This remote turns on the required device for the activity chosen  If a device doesn t turn on  the help screen fixes the problem  Smart  We had the Geek Squard set it up  It was well worth it 
The Harmony remote provides to user s one remote to operate each of their watching and listening devices  No reason to use the TV remote  no reason to use the cable remote  no reason to use the sound bar remote  no reason to use the blue ray player remote  not four  4  remotes laying around  now you have just One  1   the Harmony Remote  Sounds nice  it is     yet a challenge to set up  ours took two trips of two hours each  by the  GEEK SQUAD   to get it to work right and it does  Change cleans up your coffee table and with a little practice You won t even remember where those other remotes are  Your entertainment life will be one filled with Harmony  Good choice  Good Buy 
Purchased for my wife  who hates all things tech   setup was easy  operation is intuitive  interface is robust and elegant   a most excellent purchase 
Does more than I expected  My fourth Harmomy remote and  by far  the best  Ii
Simple and easy set up what a great product  Would recommend to anyone 
I was a little leery about purchasing this device for such a reasonable cost  Downloaded in a snap and within a few minutes I was able to use it as a baby monitor with two way communication  Excellent product
Product works great but if you want to use it with Comcast you cannot have the box hooked up to your TV with the HDMI cable  Only one output signal will work at a time  If the M2 is the only thing hooked up to your  Comcast  box s output then it works as advertised 
Purchased this radio for my work truck  It s a simple radio with a simple install  I installed myself   Doesn t have a bunch of crazy buttons and a bunch a crazy features  It s exactly everything you need and want out of radio with no flash or complication  Very sturdy and has held up well in work conditions 
I love the radio and all the features minus the fact you can t watch video on it and there s no multitasking  If you want maps open but someone texts you  The messenger opens and stays open till you close  If you could multitask it would be a lot better 
Easy to use without unnecesary buttons  Setup was simple and worked immediately  My only negative is the battery doesn t seem to hold its charge as long as my other remote 
Installed these into a Ford extended cab pickup  with the JBL GX602 in the front  and I have to say they are a super great combination  These speakers just dropped right into the factory mounting holes  All that was needed was to remove the trim  remove the factory speakers  then drop in the new speakers and replace the trim  No driliing  cutting or any modifications necessary  And for the price  you won t find a better speaker if you are looking for true sound reproduction  IF all you want is thumping distorted bass like a lot of cars I hear on the road  then pass these by as you won t get it from these  You do get bass  but it s much truer sounding bass 
Easy to use and simple set up very light tv and easy to hang up against the wall
I m glad I shelled out the extra cash for the type cover with fingerprint  No pin  No password  Touch keyboard  Enter program  Simple  Fast 
Very simple to setup for my TV  TiVo  Stereo Receiver  Playstation4  and Apple TV  Works like a charm 
Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends  on Ventrillo  and not have that cable drooping over my arms  Didn t work out  But the more I researched I found that it wasn t the headphones fault  it was Bluetooth in general  Bluetooth won t process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time  The result is using your device in pure mono  Not so great  Again  not the headsets fault  So with this in mind  I don t game with the device using Bluetooth  I use my other wired gaming headset All that aside  I love this headset  It was only  59  and I use it daily  I use it for my Galaxy Note 8  PC  Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I m not home  and at the gym The fit is just right for my head  and I like how it s very light  I don t feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly The sound is superb  I was extremely surprised how good the bass was  I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music  so that was key for me  I bought these online  so I was worried they would not meet my needs  But they did The Bluetooth connection is decent  Although  my other headsets have not been any better  I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless  My wife and two kids use tablets daily  their gaming consoles are wireless  in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC  That combined with our wireless Smart TV s  and wireless stereos in the bathrooms    we have alot of RF floating around in the house  I ll cut this a break  I can typically walk about 30  away before it starts to break up  Although  I think this is the maximum that the FCC will allow  so no heartache there The device pairs quite easily  and I use it on several devices  so I don t have any complaints in this department Battery life is actually really good  I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day  I don t let them sit on the charger when not in use  because that is probably bad for any device  When I go to charge them  the connect is bad  so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges  I m sure it s the cable and not the headset  as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature  as if I m low on charge I don t have to seek out a new headset The headset also folds up for easy storing  and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling  Nice touch if you ask me That s my review  hope this helps somebody out I highly recommend these if you re looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs Great SoundEasy to Pair to multiple devicesLong life and charges using a USB plugFolds up for easy packingComfortable fit
Solid drive   fast access and not to much heat  We ordered a batch of 12 got one doa  Fast replacement and they have been cracking ever since 
The keyboard for the Surface is a must have if you do grab the Surface  It give you a lot of flexability if you are typing for school  Plus  it is very compact 
I stumbled upon this keyboard and opted to pay extra for the convenience feature  It works quickly and works very well when using the Surface Pro  Microsoft should just stop selling the standard version and sell only this version instead  Highly recommend 
I ve had a Harmony One remote for a few years and have been very happy with it  I decided to upgrade to the Harmony Ultimate One  This has been the single most disappointing purchase I have ever made with regards to an electronics purchase  Firstly you cannot control your Amazon FireTV and other devices with it unless you shell out more money and buy the hub  which I did and will be leaving the same feedback for that also   The original Harmony One is able to control the FireTV  fast forward a few years and now all of a sudden this new remote has lost the ability to unless you buy the Hub  Let me clarify  You CAN control the Amazon FireTV after you get it set up  with the hub   but switch to another device  AppleTV  ShieldTV  Playstation etc  then go back to the FireTV  the bluetooth disconnects and you have to go through a grueling process to reconnect it all again by resetting the Hub  deleting your device  re adding your device  It s a 140 paper weight  I m computer savvy and electronics savvy  but I have to say this is the most frustrating piece of plastic I ve ever purchased  Take my advice and save your money   
I m a totally shock how well this little guy sounds   I work in an automotive collision center and it get pretty loud   This thing always sounds great  
I get to carry all of my wife s camera gear around Hope this helps
This remote is outstanding  It replaces 4 remotes and puts the control in 1 convenient unit  Very easy to use  Could not be happier  Great product 
The product was easy to set up and is providing very good quality 
For me  the setup was a little tricky  I have several pieces of gear that took some custom training but once I had that done   it s awesome  Now I can control every device in the house easily  Only downside is I sometimes have to hunt down the remote if the kids have swiped it  I am using this on OSX without any problems  Battery life is great 
Works very well on my home theater  Set up was very easy  Would definitely recommend to someone  Gave it only 4 stars because it s a little awkward in the hand  Might just have to get used to it
works as described with easy set up
Having a Harmony 1000 this remote serves its purpose  Not too fast
We found this remote difficult to use because it is so sensitive  It took several tries to enter three digits for a TV station  because it wanted to go to the station represented by the first or second digit  Also  it won t talk  to our Bose sound system  so we had to use the Bose remote and this one   so it wasn t very universal  In short  we returned it in frustration 
The unit works fine most of the time  There are times when I have to shut down the system and restart it and this does frustrate me 
Seems to work good  Had to also purchase a hub to make the stereo work       
One day my NAS shows an alert saying one of my hard drive had bad sectors and needs to be replaced  I remember when I bought my NAS almost 4 years ago  I was a bit hesitant to invest in a specific hard drive for a NAS  This time  I did not hesitate  considering 4 years of product life is not very good  knowing as well I m not an intense user of my NAS  personnal usage only   The red series of WD hard drive seems to be among the best one  So far so good  
Didn t use it personally but supposedly a good piece
Installed in a new Dell XPS tower  Memory speed showed 2133hz when all installed memory was 2400hz and all DDR4 memory  Computer would show proper memory amount but would freeze all the time  take this memory out and it wouldn t freeze   Memory Test showed errors  Replaced with Consair brand   no issues 
So far so good  Haven t used them a lot  but do like that they are lightweight and have both the phone and audio listening options 
Security   Function   Compact and Light  This one has it all  Absolutely love this Flipside Pack  I was looking for a backpack that was secure when I traveled and also smaller and lighter for hiking in the woods  I can fit my Canon 80D with 100 400 mm lens attached and have room for other lens too  I love the removable pouch which gives you versatility if needed  Surprisely  my tripod also fits perfectly  There are also some other thoughtfully designed features like the side storage area for your phone  cards and I like the strap in the front to add other items  The quality is exceptional too 
I initially was going to buy the cheaper version of this mount b  c I already had one  They were out of stock but I am happy that I got this one  A little more difficult to hang but more mobility than other product
I use this outdoors and is awesome  No longer using three remotes 
This remote seamlessly performs all of the functions i desire with one touch of a command for each function  The screen placement requires a bit of adapting  but when done  performs well 
The touch screen is way too sensitive and you can easily lock up the entire remote  If you try cleaning the screen in a room separate from the items you control it senses an operation and since it does not get a response back from the devices locks up  Have had to reset the control to fctory settings several times in order for it to function period 
Picture is clear and color is well defined  The problem is that the screen usually has a dark tint   even after maxing the brightness setting  Annoying   don t know what we will get each time we turn it on 
I saw it  I bought it  I tried it  I returned it  It just doesnt work  I cant understand why Logitech cant get it right with these remotes  I gave it one star because thats the least amount one can give 
The product is bulky  the equipment they have to connect it to your car is ridiculous and doesn t work  takes up tons of dash space  Do you like wires running through your car that is what you will get as well  Want to hook it up via Bluetooth or USB  nope only 90 s technology works here  can connect it via fm radio  although the transmitter sucks so sound quality is horrible  or aux  headphone  jack  quality also sucks  Don t waste your time

Don t waste your money on the finger print ID feature  It s great when it works  about 10 20% of the time  Most of the time you just have to sign on like the stupid version keypad  that cost less 
This tv has great picture quality and is easy to navigate 
I am very satisfied with my purchase is my purchase   I love all the features that came with it such as the Siri feature that allows me to use Siri while I m driving I m also happy with the fact that I have Spotify one of the apps that comes with the radio very please with the purchase
I have been hammering these speakers since I purchased them  they re loud and sound quality is good  Looking to purchase another set in the near future 
The Microsoft surface pro keyboard  cover with fingerprint ID was very impressive  The ease with which one can immediately access the computer was a breath of fresh air
I purchased and installed the Sanus Full Motion wall mount for my 55 LED TV last weekend  The mount itself is a well made mount and is heavy duty  It has no trouble supporting my TV and the installation was pretty straight forward  I installed it by myself and it would have been much easier if I had a second person helping The cable guides are really meant for routing cables to an outlet directly behind the TV  My outlet was down near the floor and the TV s power cable was much too short to reach when I used the guides  My other issue with the mount is that when the TV is pushed flat against the wall there is no side to side adjustment  You have to pull the TV away from the wall to move it from side to side  They could have also could have added a couple of more mounting slots for the stud bolts to better align with my 16 stud layout Overall I am happy with the mount as it is sturdy and well made  It is easy to get the TV on and off the mount 
Strong  sturdy and convenient is this wall TV mount  Very flat to the wall and 10 inches out to access the back if necessary on those moments that you really needed to access  Price was great and I would buy from Sanus again 
Ok this is for those on the fence about buying a cheaper mount or a Sanus  I have bought about 5 mounts from Amazon and they all have been the 39 or 49 mounts  They have all worked fine but i have a heavy 55 plasma and wanted an articulating mount  I would not tract any of this amounts to do anything but just hang the TV I bit the bullet and ordered the Sanus  1st impression is WOW    This bracket weighs 25lbs  Yes  25LBS  Almost as much as some TV S  The cheaper mounts barely register on the scale  You immediately notice the heft and quality of this piece  It moves fluidly and it is all finished nicely  Everything is well though out and all edges are finished  Bolts all have covers and it has ZERO cheap feel to it I was in the camp of why pay more but with TV s climbing in prices again there is no way after side by side comparison you would buy the cheaper one  Order both and when you pick up the Sanus box without even opening it you will be blown away  I will update when used for a while but unless things go bad fast I can t see tho snot being a huge jump in quality  I live in CA and always feared a tv coming off the wall but I feel 100 confident this will be up there no matter what 
Went up easy  works great
The mount fits very close to the wall and allows the TV to fit closely  It swivels up and down and side to side with a reasonable effort  The cable handler on the back side keeps the cables neat and under control 
Sanus makes a great product and is an easy installation  The only things that are required is a socket wrench and drill  It comes with a small level with a needle that can somewhat replace a stud finder  however  I did use one for simplicity  I was able to mount my XBR65X910C onto this in roughly 30 minutes and it helps to have a partner for larger tvs  If mounted roughly 10 Sanus mounts and they ve all been fundamentally the same so if you ve ever done one it will be the same process and if you haven t there are tons of tutorial videos on Youtube 
I really like my New Smart Samsung easy to setup  I really like it   I tried another brand didn�t care for it  So glad I tried Samsung 
Excellent picture very easy setup and great value 
Set up was in Spanish  Could not change  talked with a Samsung rep  Taiwan   this person knew nothing about product 
My Samsung Galaxy S8  is awesome  I really like this phone a lot 
This is the second Samsung TV I have purchased as they continue to built high quality TVs Visiting various brick and mortar retailers  I was constantly impressed by the display  Even when the TVs were not sorted by brand  I still found myself visually drawn to this model  Its very clear and seemed to be brighter than the other models to me The dimensions are great  there is very little wasted space  and the TV is light enough to easily move  Wall Mounting was a simple task The SMART TV interface is well implemented and initial configuration was a breeze I have three complaints about it though which are why I only give 4 stars 1  The power cord and the input ports are on opposite sides of the TV  This makes it that much harder to keep the cords out of the way 2  The power cord was too short for a TV intended to be wall mounted  It limited where the TV could be placed  so we bought a longer cord 3  For a while Netflix was unable to access the internet even though the TV could still download updates  This was fixed by redoing the network settings and reconnecting to Netflix  Based on my research  it sounds like this happens fairly regularly when the software is updated Overall I am EXTREMELY happy with the TV and expect I ll buy yet another Samsung TV when I eventually replace this one 
I recently bought our third Samsung Smart TV  They always deliver a good consistent product and the picture quality is very good  Smart TV apps work well and are easy to use 
picture is outstanding with lots of features I have a few of them now
This New Samsung 40  TV is Amazing   Best Quality and Features for the Price  Beautiful Picture     
Very happy with my new TV
Great TV for the money  using in an home office as a secondary TV  Nice picture and easy set up  Included apps for Netflix  Amazon adds to ease of use 
All i know is if the sales rep was honest about the data use we would never purchased it  Either way our last time we will buy from you again  Nothing was done now stuck paying cancellation fee 
Overall great quality build and size  The unit itself can fit inside my palm and is a good size for travel  the sound quality isn t great because it suffers from distortion when the volume is cranked up  If you are looking for a portable speaker that supports both Bluetooth and wifi this Sony is a no brainer but don t expect great sound quality 
Overall  great build quality and the included WIFI functionality is also great  The Sony app that accompanies it  is also well made and performs well  The sound quality is the only thing holding this speaker back  Mids and highs suffer from really bad distortion when the volume is cranked up  Otherwise  a good speaker when listening at about 50% volume 
I found it for sale at BestBuy I add the memory to my new pc It works good on my Dell Xps 8900 Not the fastest It
Used in a ryzen 1700 build on gigabyte ab350 motherboard  Started first time no issues  can t ask for much more  Good price 
Advertised as Radeon RX560 but actually is an RX460 when checked in graphic setting? Can someone explain this?
Purchased it last year  was unable to get it working in on a complex system  spend 4  hours with no luck  Today I figured I would try it on a less complex system  just two components  Well after 2 hours  it still does not work  I gave up buying any Logitech years ago for my computer systems when simple things like mice and speakers failed to perform  Now after paying 250 for a less then useful remote  I hope they enjoyed it  don t ever expect purchases from me again 
Where are the buttons Hoping I could customize to get the TiVo skip buttons  no  No number keypad is annoying  Battery life annoying  no warning of impending death  Old harmony would warn of dying battery  Please someone make a decent remote again  Returning 
Bought this bag because it has the main compartment flap against your back  The feature of clipping it around your waist and swinging the pack around to get to your camera works great  Bag is roomy enough to hold a fair amount of equipment as my wife expands her lens selection  After having a friend get her stuff stolen right out of her backpack with it on her back we were looking for something more secure  This bag really seems to be the answer in both function and security
We use these for ambient listening and they produce very loud and clear music 
Great stereo  full rich sound at full volume  doesn t need all the DJ stuff though not a system for apt dwellers just enough bass won t make your pictures fall off the walls overall Im very pleased with the performance of the total system
Bought this because I upgraded to a ryzen build and the motherboard only supported DDR4  They worked great through the burn in and are confidently chugging along through software development and light gaming 
Camera cool  Hubble service is a rip off I want to record on my home PC and synchronize the files with my Google Drive or Dropbox account  not pay endlessly for a cloud server to monitor two cams Hubble service must be making a mint Total money pit
Needed a receiver slim enough to fit in a tight space with enough power to drive outdoor speakers in patio area  This Yamaha receiver was perfect for this application 
Excellent quality  packaging and price for this higher end DIMM set 
While visiting my daughter and her family  I decided to upgrade her computer but didn�t want to wait and order from Crucial  Best Buy had this in stock and it works 
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound  Also  the bass switch really does work  Deep bass when you want it or regular when you don t  Great battery life is a plus 
I bought this to update the RAM to 4GB  This allows the machines to run the simple functions such as watching videos  reading e mails  etc  The MAC I placed it into is 2007  The process was easy and quick  No problems upon rebooting the machine as I saw in the summary that the 4GB was taken  Good price as well 
I got these speakers for surround speakers  They had to be recharged every two days and had very weak sound out of them  Sony needs to come up with a blue tooth speaker that plugs into the wall and give out better sound 
Unfortunately I had to return this headset twice  Both times the unit stopped charging after just two days of use  I m pretty careful with my stuff so I m pretty sure that the units were faulty  Very disappointed  They sounded great when they did work  Looking for a different brand 
These headphones do exactly what they say  offer superb noise cancellation  with an ambient awareness function that works fairly well  although there is an annoying hum  in a compact pair of Bluetooth headphones  unfortunately that is where my accolades stop I will gladly take you through my reasons for returning them 1  These did not fit comfortably as either  over the ear   as described  or even  on the ear  headphones and the ear cups are smaller than on most over the ear headphones  My ears are still hurting from the pressure on my ear lobes 2  I have owned numerous pairs of noise cancelling headphones  but was specifically attracted to these due to their  ambient aware  function  however when I turned it on I got an annoying buzzing sound in my ear 3  While these headphones can be paired with multiple devices  they can only be paired with one device at a time  As a result if I m watching a movie or listening to music on my iPad and my phone rings I have to take them off to take the call to answer it  assuming I even hear the ring   Other Bluetooth headphones  including ones that cost less  do have the technology to do this I own and am very happy with a wide array of Harmon products  unfortunately these are not among those If you have smaller ears than I do and just want a pair of wireless headphones with noise cancellation for listening to music on a single device then these might be for you  but for  300  I expect more 
First  some background  I went into the store to buy this computer a couple of weeks before and it rose in price by  70 overnight and then another  30 within a couple of days  I decided on a different computer  an iBuyPower  instead  Less that two weeks later  the Dell was on sale for  200 off  or  100 less than I was originally going to pay  so I packed up the other one and returned it in exchange for the Dell and a savings of  250 However  when I got it home it was immediately evident that this was a slow computer despite its reasonably high specifications  It also had a habit of randomly shutting down and  or rebooting for no reason  Now I m a computer engineer  so I know the difference between a system reboot and a random one and this was no system reboot Back it went and I got the original iBuyPower which not only has an SSD  which ALL computers of this spec should have  but a better graphics card and comparative blazing speed   oh  and as a bonus  no unnecessary bloatware 
I returned it  The monthly cost was way too expensive 
I returned it  The monthly cost was way too expensive 
Sturdy and small perfect for travelling and the fingerprint ID is very responsive  Highly recommended 
Really good product   probably no universal remote that s better  This harmony is replacing an 8800 which has started  falling apart   I m not happy that there was a product quality issue  Hopefully the new design will help 
All in good remote  Easy to program and cool features  Battery is a bit to be desired but all in a good high end remote
These are a great option for NAS devices  I use them in synology devices and have had no issues  Thus was a replacement for a different brand 
lost my original charger so bought this to replace it  works good
Great replacement speakers for the factory one in a new KIA 
Replacement AC Adapter for Lenovo laptop  Would recommend 
Got this remote to replace a broken Logitech universal  The remote has good functionality but hand feel and button placement are a little odd for me  Rounded back doesn t lay well on a flat surface 
A Christmas present for my brother in law  he received it early to make sure he was not without his music 
way better than the 880  the buttons were getting hard to push so I got this one  very easy to transfer the controls from the 880 to this remote  be prepared to pry it out of my cold dead fingers
I have been a Logitech Harmony user for nearly a decade now and this is the first time I ve ever been unhappy with a remote  My most recent remote had a bulging battery and wasn t holding much of a charge anymore so Logitech sent me an Ultimate One as a replacement even though it was far out of warranty   I couldn t just replace the battery since it was bulging and stuck in the remote   The Ultimate One remote itself works just fine once it is configured  but there are plenty of things that I still don t like about the remote I have problems getting the MyHarmony software to work at all most of the time and I m not really sure what I ve done to get it to work the few times it has worked  It usually just sits there on the splash screen on the computer and doesn t do anything  Once I got the remote configured it works but the button layout is atrocious  Once in the software  I feel like this newer software isn t as easy to configure as the older version that I used in the past The way the remote sits naturally in your hand  the most accessible part of the remote is the touch screen which is also the most useless part of the remote since you have to look at it to do anything  I like having the screen there when I need it  but nearly everything I use the remote for can be done via the physical buttons  The only well positioned buttons are the directional pad  ok  volume  channel  and menu  The exit button is ok too but I d rather have something more useful in that spot like previous channel  The fast forward  play  pause  and rewind buttons are what I probably use the most with my DVR recordings and you have to hold the remote in a weird way bridging the gap over the LCD screen while making sure to not hit the LCD screen at all  The info and previous channel buttons near the very bottom are the worst positioned buttons though since they are near the very bottom of the remote and you have to be careful not to drop the remote when going for either of those buttons I don t really miss the number pad that much like I thought I would but Logitech should have made it feel more natural to hold the remote at the very bottom by putting the battery bump right at the very bottom  They also needed to leave the LCD panel at the very top of the remote with just the power button above it and the other more used buttons all below the screen  I am going to continue using the remote since I don t want to spend the money on replacing it but you can bet on the fact that next time I need to replace my remote I will be looking at other brands if Logitech hasn t vastly improved the button layout on their remotes by that time 
We had a minimum of 3 remotes just to watch a simple TV program  Using the website  and app    we found the settings for all the different devices  Now just one button and you are on the station you wanted to watch  Note   this is a replacement remote and after creating a new identity was able to migrate all the programming with the supplied wizard within the app 
Simplicity       
Harmony Ultimate One Universal remote controls multiple units attached to the Samsung 4K TV  Easy on  off buttons control TV  Receiver  and Blu ray player all at once  Only concern is that the touch screen channel numbers must be precisely hit to change channels  Almost alwayshave to use two hands 
Took a while to get used to but has proven to be a great purchase  Touch screen is very easy to use 
This remote is adequate  The buttons are small   I have to press help a lot to get it on the right switch in the amp  But it does work and for the price it is worth it 
Read on line reviews of the Ultimate remote  and exchanged it for the model 650 with buttons and less touch screen selection of stations and activity units  Geek Squad at time of install endorsed exchange to model 650  and returned to finish programming the remote for its many uses 
This remote does wonders and easy to use  I recommend anyone to get geek squad to set it up  Too confusing for me 
The remote performs as described  I have two issues though  One is it stops working sometimes and i have use my order one util i can snyc it  Two is the location of tbe buttons they are not in good locations  Buttons that are used the least are in the best location  The more popular ones are in ackward position to use with the remote shape the way it is  These are not problems as much as a nusaice 
Remote is flaky  hard to program and still can t get all features to work as they should so I m using two remotes still 
our equipment is in a closet needed the harmony remote to eliminate the wires
I love my remote   It syncs with my surround sound receiver  tv  dvd player  vcr  wii  crome cast  song stream and cable box to day the least  One touch of the button and remote turns on all required equipment  Love have one remote  instead of 6    
An excellent replacement or supplement to manufacturer so remote and certainly an enhancement 
It was easy to set up  Easy to function  Looks really nice  Clears away clutter from many remote controls  Turns on your multiple devices all at once  You can program it to your expectations  Allows you to save favorite channels with icons on the touch screen 
I purchased this TV remote in able to combine 3 remotes to one  I had the Geek Squad set it up and was well worth it  It s easy to use and also has trouble shooting capabilities 
Harmony continues to provide and upgrade their products  This is the latest remote control products that I have purchased  Now supports  smart  services 
easy to work and program but battery life is very weak talking with a family member that bought the one with the hub and you get a better battery life from that which i don t understand it is one of the best remotes that i have ever came acrossed
The Harmony Remote is handy to use if the hole operation would be explained at a slower instruction  Great Nephew showed proper usage 
there have been a few occasions where this device would not connect using the usb cable  however  it definitely was worth the money and it works very very well  there have been only a few occasions where i had to unplug my iPhone and replug it in for the device to connect properly  but seriously  that was only a few times and it works great and i am happy with my purchase  the only thing about the interface that i do not like is that not all apps are comparable  such as Waze map app  Other than the occasional connection issue  which really hasn t been a problem  and the lack of full app support  I would have given this device 5 stars  I am VERY happy that my Slacker radio works  Apple maps work great and so does siri for use of the phone and iMessages   I am very happy with this Alpine 
I ve had a JetPack for quite a few years and am still using it for my own travel  it holds a signal well while traveling in the back country between towers  A work colleague has had the same model for many years too  I bought this one for my folks for their new apartment  Very long battery life  runs all day  It does go to sleep at night if no computers are connected to it 
Great with my Synology box    Some of the best hard drives available today 
I purchased the NETGEAR NIGHTHAWK  Dual Band Wireless AC USB Network Adapter about a month ago  Installation was easy through downloadable driver  The device identified my network immediately and after entering the necessary password connected without any issue  The connection remains reliable when booting my system and during operation  I consider the cost a bit rich and I would prefer the price point were a bit lower  hence the 4 Star s  however the device works as advertised and provides reliability in operation 
This jet pack is a great way to receive wifi  It is so much faster than our last device 
the battery life is good  always connects when turned on
Product works great  Is reliable and hasn t failed yet  Got this for a ridiculously low price  so that made it more encouraging to purchase 
Third Harmony Remote  Tossed 4 remotes away 
great speakers   have great range and sound  i have a fairly large yard and the sound comes thru very well and its not tinny   
I chose this keypad with the extra security in the fingerprint scanner  I ve set the camera and the fingerprint and they both work great 
I ve been using for nearly 2 weeks and it works great on my iPad and computer  Only issue is the remote works incredibly slow  You can press only 1 button every 3 seconds  Advertisements aren t a problem when you go to full screen   150 is a fair price considering you don t pay for the apps 
I use this to stream it to my computer in another room  It s much more cost effective to stream this on a large screen computer monitor than purchasing another TV and paying a monthly fee for an extra Fios box  It works well  no issues 
Received this on December 16th and now the charger cradle will not charge this remote  I am not sure if it is the cradle or the remote  I am glad I waited to post a review on Amazon  This remote is not worth the high price if it is not charged      I hope Logitech will resolve my issue with this remote  I will post back with any updates 
I bought this remote to replace an BluLink PS3 remote that I had used for years with my home entertainment system  The major components are a 1080p Samsung HDTV  Yamaha Receiver and speakers  Comcast Xfinity X1 DVR Box and PS3 for streaming Netflix  MLB  and playing Blu Rays  The BluLink was designed specifically for the PS3 and pre programmed  It could control up to 5 other devices  It had worked fine for about 5 years  but it couldn t control the DVR  and then started to hang up on the device functions whenever you turned it on  I ordered a new BluLink and it quickly developed the same issue  not sure why   I ve been using the Ultimate One for about a month now and it works pretty well  It s not extremely easy to program  but the MyHarmony software is pretty straight forward  so it s easy enough to figure out  There are a couple weak points  It takes a while to load new setup configurations when you update to add an activity  add a device or change the favorite channel settings  The first time I had to stop the process and restart it  but then it has worked the couple times I ve tried since without a problem  The only other complaint is that it takes a while to run through the macros it uses to execute  Activities   starting and configuring multiple devices to watch TV or Netflix  etc  and even takes a while to change to favorite pre programmed channels     you can see it run through the sequence of keying the channel number in and then hitting enter   You have to keep it aimed at the devices for the duration of this process or everything won t wind up working  something won t turn on  you ll get the wrong channel  etc   It is  one button  control  but it s far from instantaneous  Also  If you plan to use it with a PS3  or I assume PS4  XBOX  etc   it isn t directly compatible  You need to buy an additional adapter switch from Logitech that talks to the console  The PS3 adapter was no longer available buy the time I bought this remote  but I was able to find a refurbished one on Amazon for about  60  Other than that it works as advertised and is a reasonable solution for anyone looking to control 5 15 devices with a good amount of flexibility  as long as you are tech savvy enough to navigate the setup 
I got this system to replace my old  very old  Panasonic AV receiver  I ordered it because the product description said the EQ function says there is a setting that allows one to create their own custom EQ setting  Knowing that most preset EQ settings do VERY little in terms of equalization  I thought this was the way to go if I wanted a good bass setting since there is no bass or crossover controls for the sub woofer When I received the system  I discovered that not only was there no customizable EQ setting but the bass was very weak  I boxed it up and sent it back  For the price  it s junk 
great product at a very reasonable price  apple car play works very well
This bracket is good quality  easy to install  and a reasonable price 
The remote looks great and was fairly easy to program  I got it all set to go and handed it to my wife  She says  where is the key pad  How do I go from channel 232 to 863? After spending a lot of time messing with the remote  there is a key pad a couple steps into a menu item  So if you have cable TV and want to pop around channel to channel  you have to page which can take a long time  This was a very big negative to me  I returned it to Best Buy and they gladly gave me a refund  Good experience at Best Buy  I am going to try the Harmony 650  that has a key pad 
We bought this remote to replace our Harmony 650  All in all  this is a good remote  If I could  I d rate 3 5 stars  but I rounded up The good  Can handle more devices  activities than the 650  The touch screen is clean and responsive  but not overly sensitive so you don t have to worry about accidently launching a command while swiping  Scrolling up  down or side  side is a breeze  It has the most commonly used hard buttons available  so you can perform many functions without needing to look at the remote  Has an internal battery and comes with a charging stand The bad  It doesn t have a very fluid design at all  nor is it easy to grip if you re trying to use the dvr  dvd controls at the top of the remote  Not sure why they went away from a more traditional remote design  but this was really bad decision making by Logitech The remote is also kind of slow during the power on phase of various activities  Ex  I use the Watch TV activity to power on my tv  satellite receiver  theater and the remote stays in the starting mode for a good 15 20 seconds  so you can t immediately change to the channel you want or adjust volume until the remote finishes it s cycle  And you need to keep the remote pointed at your devices until they all power on  First world problems for sure  but the 650 didn t do that Activities don t work once they ve been activated  Ex  Using the Watch TV activity to power on my devices  let s say the theater doesn t power up  With the 650  I could just hit the Watch TV button a 2nd time and it would power the theater on without powering off the tv and satellite receiver  Not the case here  You have to go to the Help screen and once it turns your receiver on  it turns everything else off  Very frustrating when this happens Battery life isn t that great  I get about 3 days between charges  Maybe I m expecting too much  but I expected to be able to go at least a week  Good news is it only takes about 30 to fully charge The touch screen has a swipe to unlock feature  I guess this is great if I m worried about a stranger seeing what my favorite channels are  but it just seems kind of pointless Most of the shortcomings for this remote are pretty minor  buy there s a lot of minor shortcomings which is what keeps me from giving a better rating  I don t hate the remote at all  Overall I m happy with it  but it seems like Logitech tried to literally break the mold with this remote and came up short  If they made a remote that was basically the 650 but with a touch screen  they d have the perfect remote imo 
Got these for yard work   they do a nice job of drowning out noise while sounding pretry good after a few in app equilizer tweeaks  Load the app and mess around a bit   they re solid  they connected easy and have a cord as well if they re dead andyou didn t charge em 
Went into the store with a different speaker in mind but I found this SONY H ear Go Hg1 Hi res Wireless Speaker and it changed my mind totally  Crisp  clear full sound with Extra Bass  no distortion and plenty of power  Would recommend 
I have the slingbox application on my cell phones and tablets  Works great when traveling as you have access to all of your cable channels we subscribe to  I can watch live tv or my recorded shows  It us awesome
It was simple setup and has been running smoothly for two weeks now  I can see that it has much more capacity than my last computer  It s good for a person like me who always has multiple video  audio  and print projects going all the time 
This replaced an older harmony remote that we were very happy with but which was dying  Generally love the form factor on the harmony ultimate one and it feels great in the hand  It contols my tv  av receiver and blu ray player without any issue  after some tweaking   My biggest complaint is that I don t like having the control buttons above the screen  Otherwise  it was easy to set up and it has passed the wife test  wife generally hates any new technology I bring into the house  
setting up wasn t straight forward  needed to go back to store  but once i knew how to operate I love the headphones
Really don t have must to say I really like it great
Still reviewing this item  but sounds really good 
I can t compare it to other Bluetooth speakers as this is the first that I have owned  but I really like this speaker  It has great volume  dynamic range and clear sound that is impressive for such a small speaker  Whether it s in the bathroom or garage this speaker provides great entertainment wherever I go 
I love it because i can controll everything with just one remote  What I wish is that I could at least program it with the my tablet 
Basically bought for a 15 yr old car  so wanted the cheapest   but this radio has a ton of options and puts out good sound for the price  Install was easy  the hardest part was the adapter wires  but that was not related to the radio  it was our stupid car 
These headphones have great sound and are very comfortable to wear  They are not totally snug on the head but they work great  Very easy to set up
I don t really do heavy gaming but functions fine enough
I read lots of reviews  and I was very confused  so maybe this will help others  Bass  this has it  but it is accurate and clean  so for  bassheads   this won t be enough  get a sub already  For everyone else  it will be fine  I put 4 in a ford ranger PU and it sounds great with a pioneer head unit  no EQ or loudness in use  very clean  neutral  and sounds deeper than the rated 50 something HZ lower limit would make you think  I m very happy  and if you like clean and balanced  ie  correct  sound  you will too 
I bought these to use when gathering clips for my mother s birthday video  They worked great for that purpose  They don t seem to bother my ears much after I ve been wearing them for a while  The top band is comfy on my head  They don t cancel much noise  it would seem 
I have used different universal remotes before but had problems with them and they were not easy to use  This one is very easy  It is taking me a while to be able to click right buttons in the dark  but that will come  Light to hold  maybe too light for some  But quite simple to use and it works 
These speakers deliver a rich  beautiful sound to our outdoor entertainment area 
I wasn t really sure what to expect from the Slingbox to be honest  Setup wasn t too complicated although it seemed to take a while  I guess I was anxious to take it for a spin  Once setup it worked flawlessly in my home  Anywhere  Works great on iPhone or iPad  My daughter even uses her iPad to stream the feed to her Apple TV  The most impressive part was watching TV while away from the house  It s not perfect ALL of the time but really close to it and very usable  I am already looking at a second one since you can only have one person watching at a time 
It s really nice but the buttons are hard to get to change volume can t set clock the only time it s correct is when phone is plugged in
I m amazed at how well this works  It took a few minutes to hook it up and add the remote sensor that was included  I love being able to stream a sports show to my phone anywhere I can connect to the internet  It could use a little better menu when connecting  but I was able to figure it out in a few minutes 
Easy to set up  although we haven t uploaded all the features yet  It is slightly confusing to figure out without an actual instruction book  but getting to everything online is easy enough  We haven t had any errors or occasions where all the devices didn t act as expected  Nice touch screen  very responsive and having all my favorite channels in one place makes it a great remote 
The fingerprint saves lot of time and make you more productive  One side it feels like actual keyboard other side it makes as a surface cover plus as a productive keyboard  unlocks in less than a sec  And along with spacious mouse pad  Most I liked is very easy configuration for multiple fingers 
It was a nice loud speaker with flashing colors real good bass too
Real good remote and easy to use and does not require professional help in setting up  Once everything is program you were able to control everything with Josh one remote 
I looked at this remote 2 days ago and decided to try the Harmony 650 first to confirm that Logitech s infra red system would with our equipment and because it does I came back to purchase one of these too however  the price jumped by nearly 40 00 Lower the price and I am a customer of this remote too FWIW  the Harmony 650 works flawlessly Thank you
Was very pleased to purchase this receiver with the other products together  It has helped so much with my truck 
Great product to double my RAM for my MacBook Pro 
This RAM great improved the performance of my desktop computer  Added it to an Alienware desktop  Lightning fast now 
It s RAM  It s about as basic a component as you will find for your computer  The heatspreader is a low enough profile to fit under my large Noctua cooler  The blue and black color scheme lets it blend into a neutral case well  I ve not had any issues with the RAM in the months that I ve been using it This set is a 5 star RAM set simply because I ve had no negatives  and it was priced very competitively 
Love it  Would recommend as an easy install in my MacBook Pro 
Ram   works great  no issues  would purchase again
Works nice and sounds great  I removed the stock radio on my Harley and replaced it with this  Huge difference 
I definitely love this radio system  Online it said they were in stock but that wasn t true  It was worth the wait  For a small radio it does pack a very good sound and the price is very reasonable 
Installed this new radio into my crownline and immediately saw a problem as it would turn itself on and off every minute or two  Confirmed with a voltage meter that it is getting a constant 12 volts but it you connect to blur tooth or plug in another device to the boat it causes the radio to fail  Acquired at Frys who would not replace the radio  I believe it may have a circuit that cuts off power if voltage move just a 10th of a volt  Poor design as other brands have never shown this problem 
This was a replacement radio  easy to set up and use 
It is great product and works great and great car play for iPhone so if an iPhone user I recommend it for u
I am very happy with the sound I am getting with this system 
Pros  Quiet  Fast  easy setup  Cons  1 No easy way to install a second hard drive 2  Optical DVD drive flimsy  Should be more robust for frequent desktop use and be bluray in order to paly and record anything 3  No slot for a second optical drive Looks as if it were made as a desk top using laptop parts 
Great gift to have  a tablet and computer in one  Buy it today 
Nice and quiet on airline flights with or without the noise cancelling turned on Bar on top of head was uncomfortable and I was not able to change the earphones so that it was less bothersome  Cushioned ear phones are nice but become a bit uncomfortable after several hours of wearing them Noise cancelling feature of turning itself off after not being used for awhile is a great battery saving feature not available on other earphones that have batteries Carrying case is nice feature to have  and folding joint on earphones allow you to easily fold up the earphones to fit in a smaller space 
I was surprised to not hear it  I appreciate the long list of functions I would have never used  but was capable of  However  it was so quiet  I had to get a different speaker 
I really like the fingerprint option  It makes signing in so much faster 
The speaker was super quick and easy to pair with my phone  in a matter of 2 mins out of the box I was using the speaker  When it first pairs it warns you to download the SongPal app to your phone  I highly recommend getting this so you can control extra features of the speaker  With the SongPal app you can change the light colors as well as adjusting the levels of the bass  mids  and treble  At first I didn t like the sound of the speaker  but after some minor tweaks  sounds great and I enjoy this Bluetooth speaker 
It charges my phone pretty quick  I like the size of the charger 
We needed desktops quickly  Purchased these without researching too much and we are pleasantly surprised with the quality and performance 
Installation was simple  quick and easy  Better value than buying it already installed in the computer 
Quick and easy install  Connect and go  Easy access to great channels
Works well and very fast too  Too bad the gigabytes are so expensive
Still have not been able to fully complete setup  Complicated
QUALTY PRODUCT WELL MADE NO ISSUES BUY IT ITS GOOD STUFF
Sound Quality is goodeasy set updoes what its supposed to do
This is remote has a sleek design and is very functional at controlling all of my home entertainment devices  It took us from having 6 separate clickers to using just the harmony remote 
This product is a horrible  I have owned them for slightly more than a year and used less than 100 hours  There is no audio coming out of the right side  I have tried using with 3 different devices both wired and via Bluetooth  All with the same result  The companies customer service  stifling a laugh  is on par with Comcast  The one star rating was a gift 
Granted I m not an audiophile  but these speakers sound good in a 2008 Pontiac G5  One comment if you want to install in the same model car  it does not accept the standard round speakers  and no one at Best Buy informed me of this   I had to demolish the old speaker to reinstall it in this weird oblong clip housing  None of this is the fault of the speaker though  like I said the speakers sound better then the stock ones 
This little guy packs a punch  The extra bass boost creates a solid sound and the battery life lasts a long time  I ve had it for around six weeks  used it on 5 6 occasions for several hours at a time without another charge  Also  it hooks Tony iPhone via Bluetooth without the addition of their  mandatory  app  which I did try but was a pain to use  Great product 
Easy   just plugged it in  settings configured and done  Also got a great deal during a one day sale 
So I initially opted for the 300 series  because it was cheaper  not really knowing the difference between on ear vs over ear  after about 30 mins of wearing the 300 my ears would throb and become inflamed  very uncomfortable  I made the switch to 700 and have absolutely no complaints  Perfect fit  great sound  noise cancelation is everything  Like the old adage goes  you get for what you pay for 
I have used over 40 of these DV cassettes since I purchased my sony camcorder 12 years ago  The quality of the videos are great  I recommend them 
I love UE products  They sound great  With Megablast having Alexa  everything else becomes SMART   Alexa  turn on bedroom lights   Alexa  what s in my calendar   Yeah  great  Not only that  Megablast is portable and wireless  The Alexa Echo Plus is wired  Megablast for me wins 
Easy to install  Provides consistent solid connection Pros  Ease of installation  excellent performance  can connect to USB 3 0 port either directly or via a stand Cons  Kind of big  if plugging directly into PC  may block adjacent USB port  Associated software provides limited information 
Great product 
Stocking up on these  Perform as expected  No complaints 
Connects per bluetooth and puts out fantastic sound that can even be adjusted  like bass and treble   It s a sound system without the player  but you can hook something up as the player  like your phone   and well worth it 
Purchased for a back up recorder for vacation  Worked just as intended 
I have not hooked up the Ultimate Ears   MEGABLAST Smart Portable Wi Fi and Bluetooth Speaker  I purchased for the Amazon Alexa Voice Assistant    
We purchased this as a gift  on a budget  Great reception  and the Bluetooth is a great bonus  It was for an older vehicle  perfect gift 
Purchased 2 Sling Boxes so I could connect 2 different televisions in my shore home to do away with the cable bill 
Saw all the other great reviews and my wife needed a new build for her work so we decided to go along with these  It was a good buy and she is extremely happy with how it is running 
It had a good price for my son that s fixing his computer
Provides nice angle for viewing  Nicely mounts and close to wall 
I ve only had it for a couple of weeks  The sound is great outdoor 
The Type Cover provides a nice typing experience for the SP4  It is able to mimic the same experience provided by a notebook but it isn t quite there  Well  it s better than the keyboards built into cheap notebooks but not quite but there with the higher end notebooks  I do like that you can type at an angle or flat  I prefer typing at an angle  The keys feel nice and provide a firm  tactile feedback when clicking them in  They are also backlight and that turns on automatically when in a dim room  The Type Cover is a little flexible and you will notice some bounce when typing but it isn t bad  definitely better than a keyboard in a  400 Dell notebook The trackpad could use some work  Microsoft made it bigger in the 4th iteration of the Type Cover along with covering it in glass but it still feels somewhat cramped  The trackpad is also noisy  really noisy  I don t use it when I m in a meeting and instead touch the screen or use the Pen  But the Type Cover is protective  it can turn around completely  and it can be easily attached or removed via the magnetic connector on the bottom of the Surface  It works and is definitely the best solution on the market for the Surface Pro  just don t expect it to perform the same as the keyboard in the Dell XPS13 or HP Spectre x360 The fingerprint scanner is accurate and works like a charm  I just have to wrest my finger on the sensor and that s it  No swiping or any of that nonsense  it just works  I haven t had any problems with it rejecting my finger because it couldn t read it Most people will be fine with the regular Type Cover and don t need the fingerprint scanner  Windows Hello  which uses your face to log in  works on every Surface Pro 4  Most people aren t going to benefit by also scanning their fingerprint as Windows Hello is accurate  fast  and secure  I have used my fingerprint scanner three times in the two months I ve owned my Surface Pro 4 and that was only because I wasn t looking at my Surface when logging in Save yourself the money and get the regular Type Cover  However  people with a Surface Pro 3 should definitely upgrade to this  Logging in with your fingerprint is faster  easier  and more secure than typing in your Windows PIN number every time and the new keyboard layout and trackpad are a definitely improvement over the Type Cover 3  Upgrading to this Type Cover will extend the life of your Surface Pro 3 making it easier to wait for the Surface Pro 5  maybe even the Pro 6 
Purchased video tapes for my sony mini digital video recorder  Like the back up of the original tape after recording on computer  Tapes available on line and at reasonable price  Delivered quickly 
Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process  there was significant lag between clicking and the program registering the input 
Programming it is easy  It does take some tweaking and fiddling with it to get it to work just the way you want it  Overall a great remote 
Sleek design  user friendly  features as advertised  compact with nice carrying case 
Very pleased with Sling Box it worked perfectly while on Caribbean Vacation along with Mexico a must for anyone who travels a lot and wants to watch all the sports available at home along with access to your DVRA     
This product has great potential but I feel that i needs another update or 2 for remote codes
Product product has lots of great features and is definitely fun to play with and enjoy 
Besides eye catch product  product is easy to use and perfect for guys like me
touch screen extremely difficult if not possible to work and it makes this a not acceptable product for reasonable use  Very disappointed in this product by Logitech
Product arrived in one day  Worked perfectly out of the box  Now have to figure out how to optimize it to its max potential 
Had to replace my old desk top compter and this one had all the features I was looking for and simple to operate 
Almost a month ago I paid over 1 000 for four hub based Harmony Logitech Remotes  Two Ultimate Home remotes  one white and one black  and one Ultimate One upgraded with the Smart Control and Ultimate Hub add on I have three A  V systems   in my bedroom  home gym and family room  I used the Ultimate One   Smart Control combination in my bedroom so that my wife and I could each have a remote on our side of the bed that would stay in sync with each other I must say that the units are beautifully packaged and have a very attractive design  They feel good in the hand  I am somewhat of a techie and have had various learning  universal remotes over the years  and did not find the setup difficult  In fact  compared to past remotes in which setup involved hours of button pushing  the Harmony setup was a breeze  I was very impressed by the GUI interface   though the process of adding  editing devices and activities was agonizingly slow at times because of the sluggish slow mo response of the iOS app during the setup stage I was so excited to set up and deploy these remotes in the three rooms and happy to tell my family about the new convenience we would all enjoy   no longer having to juggle multiple remotes and devices in each room Everything seemed to work perfectly running the remotes through their paces after installation Unfortunately the honeymoon did not last long  The first night I really used the remote to watch a movie I noticed there were times when I tried to pause or rewind the playback  and the commands did not work   the remote was frozen up  Then  10 to 30 seconds later the commands I had given would be executed and the movie would start executing the commands   the movie would pause  rewind  etc  Since I had pushed the buttons repeatedly the result was somewhat comical as the TV seemed spontaneously to be pausing  fast forwarding  etc  as it executed the command I had given 30 seconds ago  This problem exhibited itself with the volume control and other controls as well The next week and a half were a nightmare dealing with first level Harmony  off shore  tech support personnel who repeatedly ran me through time consuming standard troubleshooting scripts involving resting and reprogramming the remotes   firmware updates  submitting logs to them   all with no result Finally after multiple calls and many hours spent  I was firm in demanding that the matter be escalated to upper level support personnel  At first these upper level support people would not talk to me directly   until I became very insistent that I had no interest in speaking further to the standard support personnel   I must say  however  that every support person I talked to   and there were many   were extremely courteous   in a uniform  scripted sort of way you might get in a nice chain restaurant  I eventually found out that this is a firmware problem has existed for some time with Harmony touch screen remotes  The upper level Logitech Harmony engineers are well aware of the firmware bug that causes this problem   though the front line support personnel seem ignorant of the problem  See the following link on the Harmony support site which discusses the problem  http     forums logitech com  t5  Harmony Hub Based Remotes  My Harmony Ultimate is very slow to respond when i tap the  td p  1243238  Harmony was very reluctant to admit this problem existed so don t be surprised if the above link is taken down  Just to be clear  this was NOT just a case of having gotten one defective unit  The freezing  delayed response problem was exhibited in all four of the remotes that I purchased  This is a universal firmware problem affecting this entire line of touch screen remotes   and one which has been acknowledged to me by upper level Harmony engineers The upper level support engineers had me submit my logs once again and told me that a firmware update was being worked on to fix the problem  They initially told me that the firmware update would be available in a couple of days  Then that estimate was extended to within a week  Two weeks later  not having received notice of the update  they finally conceded that they no longer had an estimated date for the firmware fix and they would be in contact with me when it was available During this saga I called in to the Harmony support line countless times  The support line is answered with a recorded greeting from the head of Harmony customer experience who offers his personal email address at the end of the greeting and invites callers to email him directly if their concerns are not satisfied  I started to copy this person on my email exchanges with support engineers  Then I wrote two emails directly to him outlining my frustrations  providing incident numbers  and seeking his assistance  The response was       crickets  It s been almost three weeks since I first reached out to this person and still I have received no response from him  So I must conclude that the invitation to contact him directly is simply marketing B S  Who knows  maybe he is not even a real person Of course  I returned all four remotes before the Amazon 30 day return window expired Seeking another alternative I found that the reviews online for the Harmony 650 remote were generally very positive  Call me a glutton for punishment after all the problems I had with the touch screen Harmony remotes   but last week I purchased two of the  much cheaper  Harmony 650 remotes to try out in my bedroom So far  knock on wood  the Harmony 650s seem to be working out very well  They are older tech and do not have all of the bells and whistles of the touch screen remotes  But so far at least they seem actually to work  I find that I prefer them ergonomically since they have hard number buttons which are much more convenient than the touch screen remotes which you have to swipe to unlock  then swipe a second time to access the soft number buttons If you have any components inside a cabinet you will need to utilize an IR extender kit in order to use the Harmony 650  There are several highly rated IR extender kits available on Amazon for a modest price  And the Harmony 650 won t control your Nest thermostat or Phillips Hue lights   if you have them  But you can already control these devices from your smart phone   so this is not much of a sacrifice Because of the good experience I have had this past few days with the Harmony 650s in my bedroom  I just ordered two more Harmony 650s to replace the Ultimate Home remotes I had tried unsuccessfully to use in my family room and home gym  My family room is a closed cabinet system so I also ordered an IR Extender kit for that location Keep in mind that I have only had the Harmony 650s for less than a week  It is possible that problems might crop up  But if I end up having problems with the Harmony 650s I pledge to update this review with that information I seldom write reviews and have certainly never written such an extensive one  But after all of the wasted hours and frustration these remotes caused me I felt somewhat of a civic duty to warn others of the serious problems they are likely to experience with these remotes Update to prior review as of 1  21  2015  I have received support on this issue  There is a firmware update that Logitech has given me for the Ultimate One  4 2 48   which has for the most part fixed the delayed response  freeze up problems that I was having previously  As of the date of this update  this firmware has not yet been released for the Ultimate One  but should be available for the Ultimate Home remote  However  if you have these problems with the Ultimate One I suspect that you can get this update from tech support  It should be widely available soon  With this fix I can recommend the remote 
A friend of mine has a portable battery pack  which I have used    it seems to charge a lot faster   supposedly longer  He claims to get 8 phone charges when his pack is fully charged  This Samsung battery pack is 3100mAh   his was 3300mAh  Either way  it doesn t appear to hold a charge very long  nowhere near 8 charges    not a universal charge port  My wife   i have Androids so it works fine but not compatible with Iphone or the ability to hook up a USB connection out  If it kept its charge longer  I would give 5 stars because it s small   charging cord is built into it  so no extra cable required 
Would like to see a little more angle in the tilt position and better backlighting to indicate when caplocks are on or using in a dark environment 
This camera is extremely easy to setup following the directions provided    it even has built in voice prompts to tell you what s happening  such as pairing or firmware upgrading  Download the Hubble application  create an account  click add a device  select the camera model and follow instructions  it couldn t be simpler The foot features two screw mounting holes so you can attach it to the wall  however it is lacking a standard tripod thread mount  a regrettable omission The camera is powered by a standard microUSB connector  adapter provided   a great choice  Only 2 4GHz WiFi 802 11n is supported The video quality is excellent  However  the camera does not offer any sort of motorized zoom  pan or tilt  a feature available on most cameras of this price range  Instead of using standards  it also requires that you use their app and their web site  Now  both the app and web site are well done  but when you use the advanced features such as motion detection  the videos are automatically uploaded to their web site while this may be a wonderful feature should you ever get robbed  it might give you pause if you sometimes walk around the house in your birthday suit to know that this lovely footage will end up on Motorola s servers I like the video quality of this camera and its software  but I m not so pleased with the reliance on the cloud and the obvious monthly fees that I m sure are coming  It s not a bad product if you re not worried about uploading your stuff to Motorola s web site  but if you want control over your video feed and access from third party software this is not the camera for you 
The camera was easy to set up and the microphone works well  However  ff you value your privacy and plan on recording  you d probably be better off looking elsewhere as any video loads directly to their site you have no choice 
Pricey but great remote   if you have multiple devices and don t mind the price  this is a great remote 
Good product but expensive  Easy setup and plenty of nice features 
It was available on sale   I bought 16gb using on my high end gaming PC  so far so good   nothing to complain
Previous version was much better in hardware and software  The problems I have are short battery charge life and it loses control of some features  buttons at different times which require you to turn off the activity and re select the activity to restore functionality of commands  Firmware updates have not solved the command drop problem and there is nothing you can do about insufficient battery for the electronic issue  Also  and directly related to the battery life issues is the over reliance on the LCD screen  I prefer a better balance between buttons and LCD screen  Buttons allow less time spent staring at the remote when you do not want to  This may be an overreach thinking that all things are better of with more  most  all of its functionality tied to a screen but a remote is not a phone or tablet  PC and the viewing source of the entertainment  it is meant to be just a control  Having to focus on the screen to command your electronics can be a pain  Mashing together two preferences into one is a cost control option by Logitech and not a consumer focused decision 
I m still trying to learn all the features of this controller  I think it is probably overkill for our simple home entertainment system consisting of a smart tv  Blu ray and sound system 
Great sound  decent range  Wish I could control songs from speaker  but will sacrifice that for the superior sound 
I had been planning on getting a new machine this year as I had an older box  But after a recent Windows 10 update in June 2017 rendered my old machine useless it was time to buy  I will add a 1 gig SSD when they are on sale and make it my primary drive  Good value and meets my needs  Before buying I had specced out all of my dream options at another site and the bottom line was  2200  nice but this is a better value  This is a powerfull machine that gets it done for me and my home office 
If you have a SP3 or SP4   you have to get this keyboard  It is just perfect  Incredibly comfortable to type  The touchpad is great  it sure has some space for improvement but it s still one of the best touchpads I experienced 
I like it  I needed a speaker for my daughter s birthday party and it worked out great 
These are pretty lite weight  My set tends to just turn off occasionally  Not sure if that is normal  The clarity of sound is nice
The speaker itself is pretty good  lots of options  You can use Bluetooth  google cast  USB  and aux to play music  The battery life is pretty good too  and the build overall is great  My only issue with it is the sound  It has an EXTRA BASS mode yet my Bose Sound Link 2 has better sound quality and better bass  This model has more bells and whistles but is beat out by my other speaker in terms of sound quality  If I crank up the volume on this and the Bose Sound Link  the Bose wins in my opinion  While the h ear go gets loud  it does not fill the room with sound as well as the Bose  If you want the extra bells and whistles I would say that this is a pretty good option  I on the other hand like the room filling sound of the other speaker  so I may switch to another one of those 
I love the extension from the wall feature  But I had to adjust the right to left offset a few inches to center the TV to the wall  After mounting the TV to the stand the TV was not level anymore because of the weight of the TV  Because of the 2 offset the frame was not sturdy enough to hold the TV level  I had to make some adjustments to the mount so the TV would be level 
This is a pretty good wireless speaker for the price it is at    when it needs to be charged it does start making a buzzing sound but once it s charged up the annoying buzzing is gone    I m pretty happy with the purchase   
This is my third XPS computer in 15 years  The first was powerful but had very noisy fans  my wife who shared my office said it sounded like a plane warming up for takeoff  The second XPS was quiet  but this third iteration seems to be edging back up in noise level though not anywhere near as annoying or loud as the first I use the XPS computer for two main tasks  Photo editing in Lightroom and Photoshop  Managing online marketing using platforms like AdWords and Analytics  This model is easily up to the task in either case  Web platforms load quickly and photos transfer between programs at an acceptable speed I would recommend 32 GB of memory as an upgrade  and the AMD Radeon RX560 video card is about the minimum usable for the Adobe products  Photoshop working on layered files needs lots of RAM  and Lightroom is heavily dependent on video GPU    video memory for processing speed  While the RX560 meets or exceeds Adobe s suggested video memory requirements  the card seems to under perform compared to the NVIDIA card I added to the previous computer I would recommend the XPS series for nearly anyone  but I suggest that the off the shelf models can be improved with more memory and better video cards over time  If I had one wish it would be that Dell pick a RAM memory type and stick with it  I ve purchased memory upgrades for my two previous XPS computers  and none of the previous sticks will fit into the next model computer  I know  memory technology improves over time too  but it s still aggravating to have 64GB of unusable memory sticks just laying around while this new computer is starved for more GB s 
This is a pretty good speaker but doesn�t have all the functionality that the Megaboom had  For example  ability to pair up other UE speakers  control volume from the app  etc  I�m sure all those features plus much more will be avaialable with coming updates 
Great keyboard and nice feel  look  The only negative thing is having to restart the laptop because the finger print scanner stops working from time to time  Don t know of that s because of the keyboard or the surface 
I guess I was expecting it to sound like the X7 or X77  though it is a little cheaper  At  200  not bad  I wouldn t pay any more 
Nice remote  Charges and syncs better than the 700 I had  Getting better on the touch screen about not hitting poorly placed functions 
I say this adapter is pretty expensive and pretty large so i have to use a wireless adapter for my pc because my gf doesnt want a ethernet cable running thru her house lol it does it�s job it was very expensive and it�s also huge
This unit was completely functional  it was just too much of a change from our older model Harmony One  Biggest drawback on this unit  without locking the screen  couldn t pick up the controller without inadvertently hitting a control on the touchscreen  Not an optimal design  IMO  Returned this unit and found a new replacement unit for our older model 
Love my camcorder and I like using cassettes over other mediums
I like being able to program the remote from my computer  The touch screen is a little hard to use  but gets the job done 
My old Sony MHC EC 909iP had the most brutal  wall shaking bass   but the CD player started skipping and stopping all the time so I bought this one  I ONLY use Sony audio because it s the best sound for the price I was excited as I hooked up this new system and put some music on  While the sound is clear and powerful  the bass is hardly audible  This subwoofer is WEAK  almost like it s not even there  I m a bass freak and was very disappointed  The salesperson at Best Buy said I could easily hook up the speakers from my old system   WRONG  I m not happy about this lack of bass but everything else is okay If you re looking for a system that has good sound and you DON T need earth shaking bass  you ll like this  But if you NEED THE WALLS TO SHAKE WITH BASS  you won t like this item  It s loud and has clear sound with no distortion at high volumes    nice but like I said  bass is seriously lacking even with mega bass on  Meh 
I found the Logitech Harmony One to offer excellent screen readability and easy to add new functions on the down loaded app  The signal is strong and dependable  The activity screen is somewhat difficult for me to scroll without activating a function that I am not interested in  I think there should be a right hand scrolling bar like web sites  Otherwise  I am satisfied with my purchase 
So glad these headphones come with a plug for portable music players  for those of us still hanging on to older technology   Powerful even without using the noise cancelling option  This was a big purchase for me   I ve got no regrets 
This is a great little speaker  Bought this on a whim  Great use of the song pal app  Really like that I can pair it with my sound bar  The speaker feels great when you pick it up  solidly built 
I haven t been impressed with portable Bluetooth speakers until now  I was looking for a portable size speaker that could put out a crisp  clean sound with some rich bass to go with it  The only two to meet my expectations were the Bose Soundlink Mini 2 and the Sony  I m a Bose fan  but in my opinion the Sony sounded even better  I did a little research and was impressed with the hi resolution specs of the Sony  It was also about  100 less than the Bose so I went for it and I ve not been disappointed  I m amazed how this miniature stereo can put out an appreciable amount of bass without sacrificing clarity  It outperforms speakers twice its size  I love it 
This subwoofers are just so powerful that makes real expensive product not worth the money  I would highly recommend this to anyone that is a bass freak  With the warranty that it offers I am confident to turn up the sound at any time 
I had bought a harmony ultimate remote about a year ago and for some odd reason I misplaced it in my move  Well I found this new harmony remote to be the perfect replacement  As long as you have the model number the options are endless as to what this remote can learn to control  I have my Motorized screen  Av equipment  theater lights  projector  and even my nest thermostats all centrally controlled by this gem of a remote  It s a must have and it s very easy to setup  I highly recommend it 
Given the facial recognition of the Surface  a fingerprint reader is only a secondary entry security option 
Easy to set up  Disappointed that there is no external speaker port  I use weather info for  music on hold  feature of phone system  Also  not sure how effective the battery back up is  Radio acted as if dead when unplugged w new batteries installed  If these features are not needed  it would be great 
Somehow landed on this one in attempt to replace harmony 650  Returned after unsuccessful attrmpts to pair apple devices   migration wasn t as smooth   just a piece of junk  That goes to Logitech technical support as well   worthless  uneducated  cookie cutter answers Opted out to spent more and get harmony elite with hub   if you can  do yourself a favor and go straight to elite 
I have been satisfied with my purchase of the Sony   HG1 Hi Res Portable Wireless Speaker  You do have to add a SongPal app it seems in order to sync the speaker with your tablet or phone  The extra base function really helps improve the quality of sound  You can also group it with another Sony speaker that has the same ability to pair with the HGI Hi Res speaker via the SongPal app  This is a nice function if you really want to fill the room with a wider stereo sound or have music play in more than one room  There s a lot of options when it comes to portable wireless speakers and I recommend checking them out in store before purchasing  The Sony HGI Hi Res speaker is well built  looks nice  and sounds great 
Works fairly well but is not a replacement for the real think  To many AD s 
Great value for the price  The sound is great and very easy to 
I love the light show  The extra bass button helps when in a large room  The sync button helps create a surround sound feel for less cost  I plan to purchase 2 more but different colors for a nightclub look 
Just the thing to have when traveling  Now I can charge my cell phone and tablets 
I have no cable where I live  I travel during camping season and can take this with me and not have to worry about public wifi 
Who does the ergonomic studies for harmony It s hard to believe that anybody greenlighted this model with it s odd layout and poorly positioned buttons 
Won t rate as a good surround speakers for the TV 
I felt the sound quality was poor 
A recent software update rendered sync with the remote impossible with their web app  The desktop app is equally useless because the text field for the password won t accept my password  Plus  the developers failed to include copy and paste  Also the remotes auto timer for the screen has stopped working  so the batteries are dying all the time Before this  it was an okay product  Great idea  but poorly executed 
This was intended to replace the harmony 720 but it does not even come close  The use is erratic and battery life is poor  Do not recommend
I purchased this keyboard to go with my fantastic Surface Pro4  the high end one  For the money this keyboard is poor quality  so rather than go for this keyboard  my advice is go for the one with the finger print reader  same price  better quality and functions  alas I still have mine  however I purchased the fingerprint one now but have this gray one doing nothing 
I have used this remote for about nine months now and have grown to thoroughly dislike it  To me the design is all wrong  My previous Harmony One remote gave up the ghost after it had been discontinued by Logitech  I liked the old one very much  but this one has tiny buttons  very close together  with some below and some above the touch screen  Trying to use it without looking is impossible for me  as I often accidentally hit the touch screen and send the TV off to some ridiculous place  Maybe it is because I am old and my fingers are too big  but I regard this remote as a big step back from its predecessor 
I have this remote  Have had it for 2 years  it is complete trash  Logitec can t design their way out of a paper bag industrial design  every single thing about the physical device is poorly designed  the rounded bottom requires you to pick it up to press buttons  Just try reaching over with one finger and hitting volume down  the touch screen is at the same time  too sensitive  and non responsive  biased completely on getting it wrong every single time  the device has literally no seams with which to let you know  without looking at it  that you are engaging the touch screen the battery lasts for a single day  a single day where most of the time    it isn t doing anything the main battery drain    the touch screen  wakes up when trucks drive by  but not when you pick it up and wave it around the Turn everything off button    is situated very closely  and shaped very similarly to the rewind button  More than once  this has caused in me a great desire to throw the remote through a window the software routinely  the device drops connections with bluetooth devices    necessitating a long and arduous process of resetting the connection    which as often as not  fails  It s wonderful to be unable to pause your movie  because the remote forgot how to talk to the PS3  there is a favorites list  which since the very first day  has refused to allow me to update it  A firmware update  very early into owning the remote  bricked it  leading to an oddessy of the worst customer experience I have ever had from any company anywhere  Logitec   Quite frequently the remote forgets what action it is doing  this takes away all of the specific mappings  rendering the entire remote inert  You have to guess that this has occurred pause  works approximately 1  4th of the time sometimes just to kick your day into a higher level of frustration  the remote crashes it NEVER turns off the PS3  even though it has been set to do so  and Logitec says that it does and the 1 reason to avoid Logitech remotes  the latency is abominable  You have time between each button press to question if you actually pressed the button this thing is an expensive  poorly designed paperweight 
Could not get the very feature I purchase the keyboard cover to work on a Surface Pro 3 
I have used Harmony remotes for many years  and I have loved them until Logitech bought the company  They have been going downhill ever since  I bought this Harmony Ultimate today and was almost done with the settings  I tried to sync and got a server error  Now my remote is a brick  It says sync in progress and nothing I do clears it The MyHarmony software looks like an Alpha release  It is very user unfriendly  and the Macintosh version looks like the programmer didn t even test some functions I will come back and update my review when Logitech gets their servers working and they fix the software 
This purchase was a big disappointment  Touch screen is too sensitive and you need to point it directly at the receiver to make it work 
The bad  It s a two handed remote  By that I mean that you have to hold it in your hand to use it  You can t just leave it on the end table or other surface and reach over and push a button on it because the bottom is rounded  Another design flub is that the transport keys are located above the touch screen   If you want to push play  rewind  pause etc   and you brush your hand across the touch screen before it times out you ll change the channel  or something else  Very irritating  The good  It s very easy to program  and the charging cradle it a winner

I have 100M and 300M from 2 different locations and Sling Box could only receive a handful of stations  I thought this would be a cord cutter but it just didnt work as I thought it would  Even when I tried it in my house it would connect then disconnect  I have Appple TV and other devices that I have absolutely no problems with  NONE  I have Spectrum and coverage in my home is excellent no problems This may work for others but it was completely useless for my needs  I returned it 
The most comfortable way to hold this controller is on the bottom  placing your thumb around the directional pad and bottom buttons  It s awkward to reach both the touchscreen and the main player buttons at the top of the remote  so playing    fast forwarding shows you have recorded  for instance  feels strange  I have large hands  but my wife experienced the same problems On the plus side  the revised Harmony software is much better  I ve owned the top line Harmony remotes for years  and all of my set ups were easily and conveniently imported from the old software  Being a previous Harmony owner might impact my review  since I m so used to how the older remotes were laid out and felt in the hand I ended up returning this remote for the Harmony 700  which has much more natural button positions and  clickier  buttons in general  making for a very satisfying hand feel when in use  Another bonus for the 700 is that the overall physical build and limited screen size makes it feel much sturdier  I ve lost two remotes to small kids who ve managed to drop remotes and shatter the screens  Teh 700 also benefits from the updated software I would only recommend the Ultimate One to people who need to control more than 8 devices 
Basically the remote works but after 6 months I can t get used to the button locations  It will get confused and think that all the components are off and you have to point it away and start the activity again  That aside  I wouldn t buy it again and will purchase a remote where all the command buttons are on the same end of the remote  Lastly  there is no warning that the battery is low  it just shuts off  It looks cool just not user friendly 
BT audio on devices was very spotty  Gave up and returned them 
Easy to install  Works great in our pontoon   
I ve been using PNY ram in all my recent builds and this set is top quality for my z170 chipset motherboard would highly recommend 
Cord that connects to item to charge is too short 
Memory performs as advertised  Easy to install and MB detected right away 
this ram upgrade worked exactly as expected in a 2011 MBP
Was trying to decide whether to buy from newegg or get these from Best Buy to avoid delivery  I do not regret it  Plug and play on an Aurora R5 
This has lots of power and is easy to upgrade  I love how simple it is to remove the side of the case  Quality parts  A nice upgrade from the Dell Inspiron i5 6400 that I had 
Would have given 5 stars if carplay was Bluetooth 
For the money  these are excellent headphones  I use for calls  streaming music and video  Great sound and works flawlessly 
Packs a lot of power and works great with other Sony speakers
Loud enough for my gym area and office love that I can change the colors directly from the app and that it connects directly to my phone for bith calls and music
This is an update from a previous review  I have had this remote for about a year now and it is absolute garbage  There is not one single time that it operates as programed and I don t have to use the help button to finish the programmed function  The remote has been programmed multiple times and all of the functions work but not with the push of one button like it s supposed to  you always have to use help  This remote is a complete let down and a waste of 250  Do not waste your money 
Picked up this set of DDR4 memory for my latest Skylake build and saw that Best Buy  of all places  had the cheapest DDR4 2400 16GB kit  The pictures show a set of Red Sticks with a super ugly  V  shaped heatsink  The actual sticks have a much more subdued heatsink with blue accent  I ve uploaded a picture   They run great  mobo recognizes them as DDR4 2400 instantly  Don t bother wasting your money on anything faster if you re just gaming  difference between DDR4 3200 and 2400 is 3% AT MOST 
This is the second Harmony remote that I ve owned  the first being a Harmony 880   Both had a one year warranty  and in the second year  both had physical buttons that started failing  On the 880  it was the Ch  button  On the Ultimate  it is the DirectionRight button  I contacted customer support both times  but they just told me to buy a newer  more expensive model  This is a 200   at time of purchase  remote  that can t last more than 2 years  Just google these problems  and you ll see that a lot of people have the same problem eventually 
Very impressed with this product  Thanks to my portable charger  I was able to enjoy the concert I attend and record a lot of videos without having to worry about my battery dying 
These speakers are exactly what I was looking for with my price range  The installation process was painless and took roughly an hour for the pair  Great speakers if you are looking to save a little money 
The best speaker I have ever owned  It has great sound at even the highest volumes 
Best pair of headphones I have ever owned  The build quality  comfort and sound fidelity are well beyond exceptional  This is a headset that can be worne for hours at a time and cause very little fatigue at best  They create an excellent seal on the ear which keeps 99 99% of sound from leaking and makes them just as good at noise canceling as active noise cancelling headsets such as Bose and Sony  THESE ARE THE PINNACLE OF SOUND 
No problems at all  Easy to set up and works great with my phone 
Not sure the remote is a necessary purchase or worth the money 
Prior to this remote  I owned a Harmony 785 which was a fantastic remote and has only been replaced by the Harmony Ultimate One as it is now getting to the point where we have simply worn it out from years of use   buttons getting hard to press  physical wear  etc The Ultimate One has given me a couple of headaches  The most annoying problem is that often after making a change in the My Harmony app  the software very often throws an error telling me it cannot load the changes from the remote  Let me explain this   unlike older models  there are some limited changes you can make on the remote itself  In order for the software to keep these changes  it must first download them from the remote before up loading the changes you have made in My Harmony so that they don t get lost At this point  My Harmony just stops in its tracks and I cannot update changes  The ONLY way I have found to fix this is to perform a factory reset on the remote  This will get it to the point that I can now upload the new settings to the remote  but if I had made any changes on the remote itself  they would be lost  Fortunately for me  I don t make changes on the remote  so I get away with it  Logitech support have no solution for me other than to do what I m doing   factory reset  This makes updating the remote a real chore that I don t look forward to I also miss the physical buttons from the older Harmony remotes that are now only available on the touch screen  number keys  etc   and the skip forward  back and fast forward  back keys that have been merged into one set of keys Once programmed up  the remote actually performs as you would expect   starts up your components properly and controls everything correctly  I just find the user experience lesser than it was with the older models  Logitech seems to have taken a backward step somewhere along the way with their new remotes 
Great sounding piece of machinery  lol looking into getting a complete system 
I have 4 of these installed in a QNAP TS 453 Mini 
Have the Geek Squad set it up  It is well worth it 
The sound is fantastic and I feel better than the most popular one everyone is wearing because of the name 
My computer continues to crash not sure why but didn t happen before 
Get s the job done  I recommend this  Love that you can push it back against the wall 
The mounts work as expected  I got two and have had no issues 
PERFECT    My gf loves her surprise birthday gift which was this tv   No issues at all with Electronic Express   Great buy   Great quality   
Picked this up for my older yoga 13 and it was just what I needed 
After reading tons of reviews  I decided to purchase this remote  I couldn t be happier as it meets my needs and my family s needs perfectly  I highly recommend this product 
I find it very comfortable to type with it but i rarely use the fingerprint ID
It was easy to setup  It has excellent picture quality and the sound is pretty solid for built in speakers  I would definitely buy another one 
This has been the best tv  I love it good price point too 
Using this to keep an eye on a new Boston Terrier  works great The Motorola Monitor Pet Scout66 is very practical to set up hardware and software wise  I was happily surprised that the cord was extra long to allow optimal positioning of the camera even if your power supply wasnt near  I used the app for my Android to sync the camera to my home wifi  It was again very practical and easy to follow  It was great that the product provided visual feedback via LED coloring as well as verbal feedback to indicate the successful sync of the camera with the home wifi  However  for the price of the product  I would expect to have better resolution of the camera  it was a little foggy  but the lag time was fairly minimal so there s probably a trade off  Other than that  the software provides some really useful and fun tools and I am happy with the product thus far 
Just plain perfect easy to assemble  easy to transport  Great brand nameQuality 
These speakers are user friendly and a fabulous purchase  I recommend them to anyone who likes to grab and go  So easy 
I already have a Yamaha RX V479 receiver and wanted to upgrade my speakers  My entertainment room is about 12 x 15 and the speakers work perfectly  Excellent sound and bass for both music and movies  I am very satisfied with the system 
First let me say I am coming from a custom designed home theater system which had a large footprint   while I am not an audiophile  I like my sound  My wife and I decided to downsize everything this year so the large system had to go  I listened to sounbars for the better part of 3 weeks an finally settled on the Sony ht nt5  After multiple discounts and rewards points I purchased the nt5 and the ht ct790 for a ridiculouslylow price  Got it all home but was missing the depth of my full sized system  I was going to live with it but my amazing wife surprised me with 2 zr7 wireless speakers for a full surround effect  In short    I love it  It s not for a purist but if you are looking to get the full surround sound effect it s a bargain  Setup is simple  you can do it with no prior experience with audio equipment  The sound is so realist my dogs react to nearly every creak ring or whistle coming through the system get it on sale or buy one at a time  Not cheap but several thousand less than my original system  I just love it 
Bought this to put in my in home office and it has worked perfectly for me 
This is the perfect size television to go outside in a corner 
Took this pack on a trip to Hawaii and it stored all of my gear safely and securely  It s the perfect size to hold my camera body with lens and battery grip  3 additional lenses  a mini tripod  charging adapter and cords  and all of my go pro gear  Highly recommend this backpack  I m glad I didn t get the next size up or down  This one is just right 
Right size for travel  and no wasted spaces  I like the way it opens  No one can sneak behind you and grab your camera     
I ve been using the Flipside 300 now for about 1 year and absolutely love it   It s the perfect size for my urban exploration adventures  It carriers the perfect amount of gear with just enough room left for light provisions for the day 
great picture and price was perfect for what i was looking for
I was very impressed by the sound quality and the overall size and weight of this product  I would recommend purchasing this  if you are a frequent music listener like myself 
perfect size for 70 200mm and 24  70mm lens plus a little room for accessories 
Great quality and it s very light to carry  Thinking about getting another one 
I needed to buy a replacement adapter and didn t want to get a  knock off  because of a bad experience with one in the past  This adapter is made by Lenovo and was much more reasonably priced than it was anywhere else
Identical to my original Lenovo charger at a competitive price 
Product was a replacement cord for laptop  Works well 
This would be my 8th harmony remote  In the beginning  the functionality was in matched but had poor quality  The 1st 4 remotes averaged just over one year of life before failing  This latest generation of remotes are near perfect  The only complaint I have with this model is that I did not go with the whole home setup  Of which we use in our down stairs controlling everything from lighting to the PS3 to perfection  The whole home hub not only allows for controlling thru walls but adds a extra level of ease on programming  The hub is networked and allows all setup to be done via apps  No plugging in the remote 
Great remote  Logitech hits it out of the park  Works with all my devices  Battery could stand to last longer on a charge 
This is a great remote for the money and very easy to use 
My family doesn t like to use complicated remotes with a lot of buttons Also you can easily select your favorite TV channels that appear as icons on the color remote screen    we use this feature way more than expected 
Perfect picture  Sound leaves a little bit to be desired  Had to update the software before we could use the apps on the tv 
As usual Microsoft has created a masterful keyboard for their Surface tablet  This keyboard as a fingerprint sensor and keys are better spaced out than the Surface 3 keyboard 
Solid feel with good key spacing backlit keys a nice plus  I use the fingerprint reader to quickly log onto either of two accounts using different fingers 
This is a perfect keyboard for the surface pro  It protect the screen when the computer is not being used and is closed 
Now looking at a samsung 50  55  for my living room
These are some of the best headphones I have ever owned  I previously had the well received Denon AH D2000 and loved them but their cord along with their weight were not ideal for travel  I recently purchased the B W C5 and waited for a headphone model that would continue their sound signature  Finally  they are here 
I have bought quite a few pairs of head phone and have never found a more perfect pair  The sound quality is amazing  The ambient noise detection is a fun feature to mess with  I had to have all my friends try them out because I loved them so much  You feel totally emersed in the music 
Works perfect for a little get together            
It was all I was expecting and maybe even more  Too prime
Love the capabilities of this remote    Much nicer them the older harmony for 40  Very easy setup with the computer  Only request would be rf capability 
I love my Carplay  it is so easy to use  handy and quick when needed  Voice quality is great  Siri is very responsive and allows for a true hands free driving experience  Even though more apps are required for a more enjoyable experience  such that you dont have to manually turn on and off apps on the phone  the apps that are incorporated   come standard are very useful and make long drives a very enjoyable experience  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a carplay  without needing to buy a car that comes built in with it 
I was looking for a decent bluetooth speaker that I could carry around while doing odd jobs around the house  and this fits the bill perfectly  Only reason I didn t give 5 stars is that sound could be a improved somewhat   
Sound quality was surprisingly good  For the dollar  I can t see it getting any better
I took these on my flight to Orlando  The battery lasted FOREVER and the noise reduction is better than my Bose  I never thought that would happen with a pair of BT phones  They are comfortable and I can wear them for long periods of time  10  10 would recommend 
Love the size  shape  and usefulness of this backpack  Used it to carry my camera and supplies onboard the plane with me  I then used it to carry my camera and binoculars on day sightseeing trips  I love the sturdiness of the bag and the fact that the zipper is not exposed when wearing  Much better than using a standard backpack 
Did not need full control as with the Elite model  so this was the best alternative to having control of multiple systems within the barn 
Bought it to watch football while away  Works awesome  
Was looking for a way to get cable at my summer home without paying for cable  This was the perfect solution  Easy set up and easy for kids to use 
Was able to get the best keyboard for little or no money extre  Great deal
I use this is in a second house so I only Ned to pay for my service in one location and watch remotely using an Amazon Fire Stick
The portable battery pack is perfect for my needs  I ride a bike aq few thousand miles a year  I use the APP Map My Ride and the GPS component of this app kils the phone battery  After my ride I may not be able to be tied down to the house or the car to charge my phone  The battery pack is portable and it allows me to recharge my phone in a very convient way 
This is perfect to go with my ipod  Used for outdoors by the pool  also used in my room  Loud enough for me to hear and not too loud to bother others  Perfect 
Used to be a Seagate fan for their 5 yrs warranty on Hard rives but started searching for other brands after Seagate reduced warranty to 1 and 2 years on general use hard drives  Started using Toshiba Hard drives since last 2 years and did not turn back  So far no problem with any of Toshiba Hard drives I have  Price is always lower if not lowest than other brands  This is my 2nd 3TB drive in 4 months  came in retail pack which is very important for me  For an anticipated preexisting drop injury to a hard drive  retail packaging lowers the risk of failing  This is not a green drive  it is designed for 24  7  365 use  I do not like green drives which turn off or spin down and when accessed they take time to comeback to speed  I use this large capacity drive for data and it is almost instantaneous when accessing data from this drive  Only negative is some clicking when accessed but it has not harmed me and I care about reliability more than these minor unimportant factors  I am very happy with Toshiba hard drives 
I can listen to my music clearly with great volume for my study room
This radio has all of latest technology in an easy to use application 
It is better to buy a product made by the company that your camcorder was made by
I am a 69 year old Vietnam Vet whose hearing isn t what it used to be  My JBLs are perfect for me in the quality of sound and the outside noise cancelation 
Have had many dell computers  Very happy with all 
I used this everywhere I went for 2 years and loved it   eventually upgraded to a larger Flipside as I got more gear  Pros  I could swing it around  open it with full access to everything  and it acted like a portable table if I needed to change lenses or clean something  Very sturdy and well built  Good cushioning and compartmentalizing on the inside  Liked the small zip pouch on the inside too keep all my smaller stuff  Cons  Very small side pouch   only useful for a phone  keys  extra card  I ended up making my own belt padding for longer hikes   would be nice if it had something already 
This mouse is a great addition to my gaming laptop  It is corded or cordless  Built in battery stays charged for a long time 
I had bestbuy install this unit in my Jeep Wrangler  I was tired of trying to get a clean signal out of the factory head unit for my aftermarket amps so I figured I would just go ahead with the Alpine  My first impression was wow this think looks sharp  you would think it was made by Apple at first glance  even the box looks like an Apple product  At first I thought the Kenwood had better touch screen response but the Alpine worked great after a few minutes of getting use to the touch screen  The sound quality is really good and the unit has a ton of pre sets and adjustments for EQ  My only complaint is there is no Pandora App  Pandora still plays but the controls are lack lustered with no apps to support it but I am very please with this Alpine overall 
Bought this box so my son could watch our local sports teams  It was not the easiest to set up  We needed to purchase an extra device to make it transmit in color 
We bought this for my mother  she loves this all in one vice having 5 different remotes 
This remote is user friendly and simple to set up 
This speaker blew me away as soon as I paired it with my iPhone  The music sounds so good and crisp and the base on this Speaker is amazing for its size  The app was easy to use and pairing was easy as well  The sound quality is what really blew me away because I did not expect it to sound so good   The speaker it self comes in a nice looking box and was well packaged  The fact that it has built in Amazon Alexa is just an added bonus because I would pay the asking price without it  I also got the base for the speaker that you just dock it and it starts charging which is a very useful feature  Easily fills the room with amazing sound quality Pros LoudBaseSound qualityLong battery lifeAmazon AlexaEasy to charge with the base  not included with speaker  Cons     can�t think of any  Maybe just the price?
Excellent to use  All information available at the same time 
It was the perfect fit for my Lenovo laptop  I have no worries 
Fits great  Great magnetic connection  Protects screen  Real keys  some keyboards are completely flat   Bought my husband one after I used this and liked it 
Great salesman   Very professional  Extremely knowledgeable about the  physical  dimensions of all the TVs  Quick purchase  A pleasant experience considering we weren t ready for a new TV but our old one was ready for the trash    Ill Be Back 
Works perfectly on a Asus x99a  II   Replaced a bunch of corsair 3000MHz that threw a bunch of errors and blue screens  Also does not feel like a step down from the higher clocked ones 
Purchased to replace the factory speakers in my teenage sons new car  he had blown one   We went to the store and tested and read reviews  It came down to the sound in the store  Rich  full and clear with nice bass  We installed ourselves in about an hour and they sound great  If you re looking for nice low end and clear  powerful sound   these will make you happy 
I probably have tried most bluetooth speakers and own currently a soundfreak and a bose  This absolutely blows them away  i place it on the edge of the pool and the sound fills the whole yard  It is clear with minimal distortion even at the highest levels  Best 100 i have ever spent
perfect buy it from amazon its cheaper     I have an 80 Vizio and its holding it perfect and very flexible to plug more inputs at the back with the swivel feature     Its so easy to pull ot and put back in place and the best part is once you push it back towards the wall it sticks to the magnite and stays put wit no movement SSSSSSOOOOOO GOOOOD
I had tried a couple different Bluetooth headphones  but I was really picky about comfort and call quality  I had returned another brand because it was behind the neck and i like to lay back and listen to music  This pair sounds great for music it also works good for calls  my wife was surprised that I was using it when I first called her  I think it is very comfortable and sounds good with decent bass and I am an audiophile 
Needed a backpack bag to handle all my equipment and sup pies  This would up be a perfect selection 
This backpack is amazing and easy to use  The function of this backpack is simple to know and to learn  I really recommend people to buy it
This bag is perfect for me and for my Nikon D3200  The inside compartment is adjustable for your lens  I ve used it a bunch of times so far and love the back security of it as well 
Fingerprint sensor works every time and the cover protects the screen as well   
This was a perfect accessory to the Surface  I would recommend it 
For  119 you get big bass big sound and big battery with lights to top it off 10  10
Great remote  Love the charger  The support is great  My 2nd one and even my wife can program it 
I purchased this as extra memory for my Alienware PC  Easy to install  speed is spot on and these have good heatsinks Would definitely buy again 
I purchased this bag for my Magic pro  I seen how big the space was  I was even able to fit my osmo 4k camera in it as well 
It easy to store on the go and great for any gathering The sound volume is amazing  you would never know how small the speakers are from the distenc it carrys 
Just what I was looking for  practically brand new  thank you  
These speakers are perfect Clean  crisp soundInstallation was easy
This bag is perfect in all ways for a videographer 
TV was exactly what I was looking for and more  Reps helped me find the best tv at the best price
My second time owning a weather radio  This one is straight forward and does the job  I like knowing I will be alerted to severe weather even when I m not paying attention  It s up to you  but I recommend turning off all alerts  You can t disable Tornado Warnings  the only one you really need to wake up in the middle of the night for 
In battery savings alone this remote pays for itself  Just look around your house and you will see how much battery dependency you have alreeady
While the universal remote concept is great idea  i e  combine many remotes into ONE    its not without complications    like others here  I have tried these in the past  and there always seems to be a gotcha after you are 25 hours deep into making it work ideally    pay attention to these reviews    line of sight is a big issue  although they do sell an RF adapter  even that might always work  so be sure to buy with return policy  Harmony line is getting better overall  better web interface  instructions  etc I do not want to repeat many of the items listed in previous reviews which I agree with   however  I will add this   before jumping in  ask yourself  what am I really gaining here If you have a lot of complex remotes  sometimes it can take u days  maybe weeks to get this Harmony to do everything the current remote does  Then  even when it does  is the Harmony as intuitive as your existing remote Is the key layout ideal for the remote you use the most A good example is Directv DVR  their remote control is laid out in a very intuitive manner  it serves ONE purpose  and performs that one task very well  To make a Universal remote equally intuitive would be nearly impossible Where I see these universal remotes as a good fit is     multiple remotes that u use in sequence to switch between audio  video  input and output sources  These functions can be reduced to a single button on a universal remote such as this Ult  ONE  However  as others have correctly mentioned  don t even attempt to do a project like this in an hour or two    very unrealistic expectations  u really have to be a pit bull  a gadget master  goal oriented  type of person to make these devices the more complicated tasks  Not for those with ADD or who get frustrated easily  OTOH  if you have the time and nrg  are well versed at these types of techno projects    and u desire to simplify your multiple remote controls  this might be your dream remote control 
This was part of an overall car stereo system I purchased  Great system at a good price 
This was part of an overall stereo system I purchased for my car  The sound is great 
Took a long time to get this set up as one must use a computer and manually select each component  I still can t get it to work with the sound bar  Old model of this remote was much better when all I had to do was point it at the device that I wanted to link it to and push a button for it to automatically connect to each device Too much money for this product   next time I d go with a cheaper alternative
Item was purchased as a gift and intended to be used day of celebration  A 2 year old could have opened my item the way it was when i got it  The items box was teared  soiled and barely recognizable  The worst part of it all it was that it was a completely different used version of the item I originally purchased  Very disappointing  Received a full refund 
This speaker really packs a punch  Fantastic Sound   I have only experienced one other speaker with a little more bass  however  it is much larger and does not have all the other features   The Ultimate Ears Megablast has Amazon Alexa which is a really great feature  I have linked the Alexa to my Dish Network and can tell Alexa to change the channel  pause  rewind etc I also linked to my iHeart Radio account to play my music lists  Of course  if you have Amazon Prime you can have Alexa play Amazon Music as well The family loves asking Alexa questions  Still learning everything you can get assistance with  Looking forward to connecting more smart home features The Ultimate ears Andriod app is pretty clean and easy to use  You will also have to download the Amazon Alexa app to set that feature up  Pros Sound Quality360 directional soundWater resistantLong battery life  up to 16 hrs Alex AssistantBuilt in WifiRugged BuildCons Placement of USB charging port   * Not an issue if using Charging dock which I recommend  Some Apps not yet supported by Alexa  Spotify  Pandora No EQOverall  you won t be disappointed with the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST  Great quality product  Highly recommend 
Being a tech junkie and audiophile  I have bought and returned many a headphone  The B W P7 I will keep  The sound is true to the recordings  The clarity of vocals is great and the balance of highs and lows lets you hear what the recording artist intended  Too many headphones these days are targeted at kids with thump thump thump bass to an extreme  The P7 has a nice bass but not at the expense of the rest of the sound spectrum With high quality recordings these sound great  have been listening mostly to rock  U2  Midnight Oil  AC  DC  Short Skirt  Long Jacket is amazing on these headphones  For Dropkick Murphy fans try Rose Tattoo on these headphones and see how many instruments you can count Yes  these are pricey and not for everyone  But if you enjoy balanced sound  clarity and headphones built to last  buy the P7 
works great    I have an older car with no XM so I added this it is great  
I purchased this in 2015 and I still use it on every adventure trip  professional shoot  and personal camera experience I go on  I love the design and the shape as well as the weight  I thankfully have had no issues with the zippers but am just starting to see wear on the seam that attaches the bottom and the part closest to my back  I tend to get into rough terrain and treat my pack roughly  although not SUPER roughly as I obviously have camera gear in it  so I m happy it has lasted this long  Depending on lens size  I can fit a DSLR  a mirrorless body  5 or 6 lenses and a lens adapter plus cards  batteries  and chargers  The size is great and allows me to carry a TON but not overload myself entirely  I also love the carry handle on the top  So handy  I would like to see a separate piece that attaches to the top of the bag to help keep a tripod steady   if you re not carrying a tiny one  the top of the tripod will pull its weight away from your back and tends to sway around  I ve found ways to tie it but it would be a huge improvement if it was already attached  Highly recommend although I d like to see the previously mentioned tripod support and a reinforced bottom 
I hate this Logitech remote  The display screen has a terrible delay when trying to change channels  input channel numbers  switching between tv and movies  It is frustrating to use  not because it is difficult to understand  but because of the delay  It takes about 4 5 attempts to put in a tv channel number correctly  For the price  I would expect a better product 
Bear in mind I am writing this review after not having a black screen on my Iphone6  all day and finally had to do a hard reboot to get it functional again  CarPlay has glitches and most of the icons on my phone dont work on the ilx 007  If you need to get one now  I recommend the Kenwood that also takes Bluetooth and Android phones  Carplay is still not where it needs to be  The touchscreen does work excellent though 
I had high hopes for the remote  I initially programed basic functions  but I found the process cumbersome  and I consider myself fairly tech savvy   As a result  I found myself using the original remotes when I got frustrated  Basic channeling changing took too many swipes and the touchpad would not always read my gestures 
Yes  Sound great  However  Wireless is the wave of the future  As I m writing this  The new P7 Wireless been released  Hmmm  Same sound  These are a runner up against the Sennheisers WIRELESS momentum
These are for men nice home theater equipment  and wives who are clueless how to do something as basic as Watch TV
I ve had a love  hate relationship with Harmony for the past 10 years   but no more second chances Just like every Harmony I ve ever owned  setup for this required a call to tech support  I m fairly tech savvy  and this should be easy to set up  but it wasn t  And I know it wasn t me because it took tech support 30  minutes and 7 syncs to make it function properly  Yes  properly is in quotes because even at its best  it was unimpressive On my own using the software  syncing failed to load my activities into the remote  And again   it took tech support 7 syncs to make it work Even after it was working properly  it was still frustrating to use 1  When switching between TV and SMART TV  it would power the speaker bar on and off  Does Logitech not understand that TV and SMART TV are not 2 separate devices and if you are switching from one to the other the sound should be left on With a remote this expensive I shouldn t have to dig out the speaker bar remote to turn it back on every time I switch activities 2  Lack of physical buttons for numbers is annoying  Any time I need the number pad I have to swipe to unlock  then swipe to get to the number pad  Technology is supposed to make processes faster   not slower  And yes  I know I can turn off the lock feature   but then every time I grab the remote it does something I don t want  and that something usually requires time consuming troubleshooting 3  As I mentioned before  programming this remote is a nightmare  2  hours  and even then it couldn t stand alone  I ran into problems only tech support could solve  and even then it took 30 minutes AFTER I had all the correct devices loaded  Please note that this was a simple configuration  Sony smart TV  Fios DVR  Samsung speaker bar  All less than 3 years old  After I returned this remote I bought a learning remote and endured programming every single button individually  and it still took a fraction of the time 4  There is no POWER button  Only an OFF button  You turn things on by selecting an activity  And as stated before   switching to a new activity powers things off that a remote this expensive should understand should be left on  If you are going to have a single OFF button that powers down everything with an activity button that turns everything back on  you should have an ON button for each device so you can quickly turn on any device that for whatever reason doesn t turn on when you fire up the system with an ACTIVITY button  And again   having to do an initial swipe to get to the ACTIVITIES just to turn the system on is annoying  Why does Logitech insist on writing code that slows down the power on process5  You cannot utilize the Harmony software without plugging in the device  Why When things aren t working correctly  which is often  we should be able to fire up the app just to review the settings  Then  when you do plug the remote in  you have to wait for the remote and your PC to establish communication  Don t software engineers understand that we HATE waiting for technology to do things Especially when forced to plug in when we don t want to Speaking of plugging in  it is difficult with this remote  First off  there is a totally unnecessary door  That door gets in the way when you re trying to plug in  and plugging in is difficult enough already because the mini USB port is deeply recessed inside the door  Do we really need to cause all this hassle just to hide a mini USB port C mon Logitech   don t you guys own cell phones Mini USB doors are annoying and useless  which is why cell phones stopped using them   Try to keep up 6  Tech support is only good for 90 days  Based on my experience with this remote and 2 previous Harmony remotes  this means that any changes I make to my very simple home entertainment system will not work  and I will not be able to get help to make them work A remote that costs well over 100 should assimilate my entertainment system like the Borg  It should be simple to set up  function extremely quickly  efficiently  and be highly intuitive  This device is just another example of technology that steals away hours of your your life that you will never get back 
The remote work when it wanted to  It would turn things on when it wasn t supposed to and it was awkward to hold 
Too easy for you to barely touch it and something totally different appears  If you don t touch it just right  you never know what you will see  And you can t leave it on the charger  so if you run your charge down  the remote is inoperable  A charge only lasts 3 days  Battery operated would be better  My husband calls it garbage 
I got this to consolidate my media room components  Not too hard to program  just took some time  Make sure you have a clear shot to the receiver with this remote  like glass doors or open space on your rack  Feels a little plastic cheap but it does the job well 
Overall very happy with this product one issue I have found is trying to use the cell phone and GPS at the same time does not work every time  Because everything is ran off the phone
Pulls all entertainment components into one remote for control
This led tv is working fine  It has web browser facility which is good  Overall its nice 
This would be a great speaker for rock and roll music  Not rap or hip hop
I bought this remote to replace my Harmony One  When designing this remote  it is clear that Logitech was trying to put as few buttons as possible  They put most of the functionality on the scrolling touch screen and made some of the buttons dual purpose  The channel down  up buttons are also the page up  down buttons   This can be annoying at times  I have only had this remote for a few weeks but it is pretty good  I think it will get better when Logitech releases software updates  Maybe this will increase the battery life  I am rating it three stars because of the short battery life  It seems like I have to put it on the charger every other day  My Harmony One would go a week or two between charging  with the same amount of use   I suspect that the shortened battery life is a result of more reliance on the touch screen 
The remote was not a smooth install for me to pair up with my existing Hub to replace the remote I had which died after a year  The battery life is shorter than expected and the touch screen can be over sensitive  but it does exactly what I expected it to do  I am holding out on one extra star due to past experience with Logitech hub remote for quality  let s see how long this will last before it breaks  if it doesn t last at least 10 years then it is garbage to me 
I am little concerned about the picture when I am viewing regular TV  It seems very cloudy  hazy on the screen  I have another TV in my house that has a great picture on it and coloring  I have done some research and it appears there is a fix to this  but I am not sure what that would be  It is weird that it can switch between what appears to be a normal and nice picture to this cloudy  hazy picture within a movie  show that I am watching  It sometimes appears to make some of the items on the screen translucent  I have changed between the different options for the picture output and it still happens  It is strange and a little concerning to me  I am trying to determine if I should return the TV and pick out another one  There should be a maybe option for whether or not you would recommend the TV  I selected yes  but really would say maybe  If the issue can be resolved without returning the TV  then I would say YES 
Set up was fairly straightforward and the remote works well  If you re used to having a remote that turns on the tv and then you can change the channels and volume right away this is not the remote for you  There s too long of a lag before you can use the control 
Stereo was installed correctly and timely  Wish it was Bluetooth but I ll live 
9 times out of 10 I have to press HELP to get the chosen activity functioning properly  This is my third remote from Logitech and I thought based on the price and the time passed since the first Harmony I had used that this one would function properly  No such luck  I would not recommend spending  250 on this thing 
Over all this is a pretty nice little stereo  I don t really think it is 1800 watts  Sound is very nice  everything does like it should  For Outside use  which is what i primarily bought this stereo for  it could be louder  Someone posted that they got called for to much noise 6 blocks away  It doesn t go that loud  You can turn the volume up all the way and listen to it  do it all the time  Wish it was Louder  Lol   I like the stereo and would buy it again  would make a great indoor unit  but outside it as it s limits 
It s nice and flat  Some times the keys don t work until you reset the cursor  It s nice having the finger print ID 
Expensive? Yes  Worth it? Absolutely So much better than anything else I ve tried  Check them out  you won t be disappointed 
Upgraded from 3 year old Beats  These P7s headphones are out of this world  strong vocals and just enough bass  Try it in store but take it home and it will leave you speechless  Just close your eyes  play your favorite music and just drift out of reality  Amazing 
Bought a 2011 13  Macbook Pro  Installation was  pardon the pun  a  snap  literally  D Great value
I purchased a Lenovo first and was so disappointed  This unit is ideal for everything  It is well constructed and ultra fast 
I was puzzled when I first saw the shape of these speakers  but now I get it  They really work well  The wide dispersion feature of these speakers really is amazing  Our speakers were mounted horizontally under the eave as recommended by the Geek Squad installer with the passive radiator deflecting upward 45 degrees off the eave  They defy the rules I have read on other websites and are mounted about 40 feet apart  covering the 30 foot wide patio area and large wide yard with excellent sound  I was skeptical because not only are they wide apart  but the area is on a ridge overlooking a valley  and very open  They sound great  matched up on the second zone of the Yamaha RX A710 
This is a great audio system  High quality crisp clear sound even at high volume  high power  Can make any space a small night club  the bass can be seriously bumping If desired  or use it to play low volume clear and crisp classical music or jazz  Great price point for the quality of system and sound  Can t wait to have a pool party with it and bug my neighbors 
Simply excellent sound  Beautiful build with auality materials as you would expect from B W  The sound is exactly what you want from a pair of headphones  Clear  dynamic and with excellent range 
I ve never had a remote that is easier to set up than this  the online set up was quick  simple and very easy to accomplish  I would highly recommend this remote to anyone looking to simply their remote control life and bring them all together into one easy to use controller 
This is my fourth Logitech Harmony remote and my second favorite thus far  Outstanding product and very easy to set up 
This was a reasonable price   It was better than I was told  I am so pleased   You would not regret buying it
Having read the other reviews before I purchased this item  I have to say that it by far exceeds my expectations  They do cut in and out OCCASIONALLY  but overall  they deliver high quality sound  The thing I wasn t expecting is that the small built in microphone would be so good  I was expecting to have to turn them off to take a phone call  but they work great for hands free phone calls  I would HIGHLY recommend these headphones to anyone  They are GREAT  I ll learn to deal with my ears sweating   
Outstanding remote  This is an upgraded version of the prior Ultimate One remote  It is better in all respects  And  the setup was super simple and virtually flawless  I must say I am impressed with Logitech on this product 
This sells for 250 and I got it for 79 50   it is a wonderful remote 
First and foremost  don t buy headphones based on reviews  Sound quality is subjective  take your own music source and go compare headphones in store  Listen to your favorite Genre  Tracks and allow your ears time to become accustom to the sound with each headset My requirement were for good quality wireless headphones  I had initially considered the Sony MDRX950 s after reading many factorable reviews  Upon listening  these proved very disappointing  the lower range was over emphasized with poor clarity in the mid and high range  Using the same sound source  I progressed to the Bose Soundlink s and the JBL Elite 700 The Bose SoundLink s just didn t seem to work for me  Whilst these felt very comfortable to wear  the build felt a little  cheap   From a sound perspective  the soundstage felt confined  leaving you under no misapprehension that you were wearing headphones  They conveyed a definate biased towards the mid and high range  yet lacking clarity and precision  The base response left something to be desiredMoving on to the JBL 700 Elite  These felt more substantial in construction  the ear padding was certainly firmer and whilst heavier than the Bose Soundlink s  didn t feel that way once on  The soundstage was very open  inviting and exhibiting exceptional clarity across the range with a good base response  Turning up the volume  It was easy to become completely immersed in the music and forget I was standing in a Best Buy store  listening to music via Headphones     I was that impressed While the requirement was for wireless headphones  I also tried the Bose QC25 s which were certainly far superior to the Soundlinks  exhibiting a much clearer sound with better response across the range  Had the Soundlinks performed in the the same way  I would have been hard pressed to make a decision In summary  if you re looking for a wireless headset  the JBL s are hard to beat    but then again  that s my opinion  go try some and decide for yourself 
lights outs pc  excellent speed  used for business
These are just remarkable headphones They re not inexpensive obviously but I guarantee you ll feel like you got your money s worth I highly suggest you listen to music from a true hi fi source such as Tidal online to appreciate just how great these are 
Tried the P3 s  loved the sound quality but didn t like the feel on my ears after an hour or so  Decided to switch to an over the ear model and love the P7 s  Vocals are crystal clear and the bass is rich without the overdone bass of many headphones  Very comfortable for long periods and with glasses on  They sound great with a tablet  phone  desktop or receiver and can play as loud as you would want without distortion with any of them  Expensive but worth it 
Excellent sound and the design fits our patio  Very clear and loud
Great sounding speakers for outdoor patio  Easy to install
The sound and bass are incredible  Using them as outdoor speakers 
Get CH 130? IF No THEY are selling you an outdated platform
My unit failed the setup process  After a time consuming call with the Sling technical support center  I had to have a replacement unit shipped  It took several days to receive the new unit  There was no real apology or compensation for my time and trouble  The new unit worked perfectly and the original unit has been shipped back to Sling  It is only fair to say that this is the only problem I have ever had with a Slingbox 
Meets expectations  This Me electronics company appears to make good stuff 
Appears to work pretty good  ran into issues during the installation with it not connecting to the internet  I had to open port 5301 on my router and it was smooth sailing afterwards  9  11 would buy again 
Bought open box and it was defective  The main speaker had no sound so I returned it for a full refund I have a similar 2500W Boytone speaker with a different design that works great  Bass can be adjusted with the remote and sounds great  Unfortunately the one I got was defective 
I purchased an open box keyboard  Looked and works like new  Definitely a great upgrade from the keyboard for the Surface Pro 3  Typing feel is improved and the fingerprint unlock works fast and easy 
We ve purchased several univeral remots from Logitech and have never been disappointed   This model is great 
I was a little hesitant about spending this amount of money on a remote when their are so many others out for a lot less money  but I want on a friend of mines recommendation of this remote and I couldn t be more happy with it  It controls every piece of equipment in my family room except my Sonos speakers and it may control them also and I m too slow to figure it out  Eliminated four other remotes I was using 
I have several Logitech Harmony remotes   880  One  and Ultimate One  The Ultimate One is very easy to program  though I have not set it up for smart TV web surfacing or movie streaming  I at least have instruction on how to do  Pretty much connect to your computer and Logitech website  enter your makes and models of equipment  update the remote and your are done  Logitech had made one big improvement in their website for remotes  in that you can now have multiple remotes in one account  copy all settings for one and program another  etc  Takes the pain out of programming a remote  Highly recommend  I would say that I have a basket of remotes being unused   but guess who get to hold the Harmony? The wife   I get stuck with others    Hey  why don t I just buy another one?
This is prefect for my 60 TV  There s also a YouTube video from Sanus on how to set up this exact mount and how to adjust  very useful  VERY happy with this purchase  highest quality wall mount  Also picked up Sanus soundbar mount from Target  work perfectly together 
It s not something they can do anything about and I have purchased the numeric keypad  but can never remember to use it  I guess I ve adjusted to the keyboard  Thumbprint is sometimes temperamental 
I needed these camcorder tapes and Best Buy online was the easiest way to obtain them
Just a solid build  great product  The welds are perfect and the movement is pretty smooth  Super slim  even for a curved tv 
Easy to use and control everything in your home  somethings you will need the hub 
Family Friendly remote for all ages anymore can push one button and turn everything on you need
Apps that are preinstalled do not work  I called Samsung and they told me it wasnt their fault 
Blown right speaker  Used only three days connected in mazda miata with no amp  Which is crazy lol
BT connections is the worst
do not purchase    and if you do   don t count on any Samsung support when it stops working
Doesnt cycle through inputs as it should  Switching between activities rarely works 
Don t buy this product is so cheaply made u can t do nothing with it Not worth a penny 
failed to operate devices as claimed
For 250 I shouldn t have to install software on my laptop to program the remote 
Hit or miss when turning on  off TV  Not user friendly  No user manual  returned product 
Placement of buttons are just confusing  What was logitech thinking 
Sounds flat  can t get treble in quality Also too complicated just to use 
Spend more to get something better than these 
This thing is a total piece of crap  Save your money 
Very complicated to use  not user friendly at all 
very poor quality
Great option and worth the money  Setup the remote for tv  audio  Xbox  dvd  etc and throw all those other remotes in a drawer  Kids love being able to pick what they want to do   watch tv  and all the necessary items turn on for them  Awesome buy 
Wow  that sums up this product My better half was complaining the other day that our entertainment system is too complicated for her and how she hates having to use four different remotes and turn on three different devices just to watch a DVD or Bluray movie  So to make her life easier  Happy Wife Happy Life  I began to research and look into a good solid universal remote to control my media devices in a more user friendly way  I looked at several different Harmony models and a few of the others on the market My System consists of a LG Flat screen  Sony Receiver  Sony Bluray player  Scientific Atlanta Cable box with DVR  Apple TV  Nintendo Wii  and a Sony Playstation 3 I needed a remote that would enable me to control all of these as well as have room for anything else I may add down the line  The programability and functions this remote offered seemed to fit the bill perfectly  So I ordered it Took it out of the Apple inspired package and connected it to my Macbook Pro upon delivery  Downloaded the app from the website and it walked me thru the entire set up and programming process within minutes  i got the actions set up exactly how i wanted them  said what devices need to turn on and what inputs need to be switched  and it was done  3 minutes for the remote to sync up from the computer and it was ready to go First test showed this product does exactly what it says it does  And it just works  the remote feels good in the hand and I personally do not find the button placement to be awkward at all for the hard keys  Its a very sleek looking piece and most importantly does as advertised and does away with numerous remotes I select Watch Apple TV action on the touch screen and it turns on the Apple TV  switches the receiver to the correct input and away it goes Select Watch TV it kicks on the Cable box  switches to the correct input  and away we go Yes its a little pricey  but its worth every penny 
We not really  It is nice to have one remote but this one has its flaws Pros  Remote works and has a bunch of features  Nice little touch screen Cons  it doesn t always do what it is supposed to  It locks or goes to other modes so you have to backtrack  The form is not great for hands  It is an odd shape and it is slippery  should be more grippy 
Glad we had Geek squad program it So good to have only one control now  
Finally we have only one remote instead of 5  This remote is very easy to use  Love it 
Have a rayzen 5  msi b350m bazooka motherboard and a rx580 4g video card  Did not boot up when installed  Remove one stick and it worked switch and did not work  And the ram wasn t compatible with the motherboard   CPU  crash randomly  I would not recommend for this specific set up
This is a must have for anyone with a surface  It s so durable that we ve bought a new surface but continue to use this keyboard 
I will start by saying we love our Echo and Alexa  and now that we have the opportunity to take her mobile we love it Performance wise  this is a pretty good speaker as far as bluetooth speakers go  It is one of the loudest ones I have  I wish it would pair with other speakers for stereo sound  but it isn t a deal breaker  It is easy to connect to and having Alexa on the go is pretty cool  If you are looking for a waterproof speaker  you can t go wrong 
i have tried several of this type of remoter  The Harmony is one of the better ones out there for sure    and for the price point  THE BEST 
I ve owed a pair of P5 S And think that those were the best until I got a hold of the P7 s  Then my opinion changed  I also like having something that no one else has  I see BEATS HEADPHONES everywhere everyday  To own something that no one else has is simply bliss 
Sporty  Loud  waterproof  and most importantly it has Amazon Alexa  This Bluetooth speaker has far been my favorite on the go speaker  I ve owned several Bluetooth speakers  and this has far been my favorite sound wise and looks wise  I got the black option  It s discreet and simple just like a speaker should be  It s larger than your average Bluetooth speakers  Height  9 3 inches  Width  3 5  and Weights about 3 pounds  To use Amazon s Alexa  you will need to download the �Ultimate Ears� app and sign on with your amazon prime account  if applicable   you will also connect to your WIFI with this app other than that it�s a basic app with minimal features  Nothing stands out in this app  To really customize your Alexa experience  you will also need to download the Amazon Alexa app once again log in with your amazon prime account  you can enroll to other music services  Spotify � Must have Premium  Pandora � Basic Account okay  Tune In � No acct needed  and Iheartradio  so you can command Alexa to play these music apps by voice command The sound coming out of this Bluetooth speaker is great  It�s loud  loud enough for my 1 bedroom apartment  The highs are nice  but when playing it loud the lows drown out a little bit  it�s not really on the bass heavy side but that doesn�t take away from the clear sound this speaker has  It didn�t bother me at all  It really sounds great  I also recommend that you also include the Charging Dock with the speaker  it�s roughly 40 dollars and it�s well worth it  It�s make the charging effortless  you just place the speaker on top of the dock and automatically starts charging  I placed the charging dock next to my bed so when I wake up I just turn it on  command Alexa to play my favorite music apps or tune in  talk shows   ask what�s the traffic time to work is  and turn it off when I leave to work  I like that the company includes a 2 year warranty  better than the average 1 year warranty  The battery life is 16 hours which is more than enough for your music needs  I haven�t tried the water resistant feature  but it states it can be immersed in �liquid� up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes  Overall  I really like this speaker  and all speakers should be like this product moving forward  It�s really a great Bluetooth speaker and I normally don�t like paying North of 200 dollars for a speaker  but this speaker is worth it and recommend to anyone  
This device makes signing on such a breeze  I would recommend this to everyone 
Had so many issues with my previous adapter that it was such a jump in connection quality  I couldn t believe it 
The Bowers   Wilkins P7 over the ear headphones are  hands down  some of the best consumer  professional level headphones you can buy  There is virtually nothing wrong with them beyond being every so slightly tight fitting You are given the immediate sense you�ve purchased something special  The packaging is simple  elegant  and compact on the outside  Upon opening the box  the headphones are folded by themselves in a molded case  And what a great thing that is  Highlighting the design of the B W P line is essential to the overall experience  as there is nothing like them  Besides the use of high quality materials  aluminum  sheep�s leather   the metal frame curves around the square shaped full sized ear cups in a graceful way  The hinges that allow them to fold more compactly are solid and industrial feeling  The ear pads are attached magnetically to the cups  and gently pulling and removing them reveals the drivers beneath  The leather padding on the ear cups and head band is soft and thick  And adding to all of this tactile and visual joy is the smell of leather  It compliments the �first experience� with them in a way that I�ve not had with other headphones Pulling up a small tab on the molded case reveals a leather carrying pouch  a simple instruction manual  and a spare 3 5mm cable  That�s it  It�s simple and encourages one to get on with the reason why you made the purchase to begin with If you were impressed by the design  the sound is only more so  It�s obvious there was a meticulous amount of attention in how sound is delivered through the P7s  There is a level of detail revealed here that is stunning to hear  Music comes to life in all frequencies of the sound spectrum  Lows are rich and punchy with no overt boom or distortion  Mids are exposed and centered enough to be able to easily hear without inducing ear fatigue  And highs are light  crisp  and full of detail  For being close backed headphones  the sound stage is surprisingly large and open  There are times where it�s easy to forget you are wearing a set of headphones and not listening to a high end stereo system in front of you  Part of this is due to how excellent the sound isolation is and part to how superbly well delivered the audio is It feels like B W has gone to great lengths to make the P7s reproduce recorded audio the way an artist  producers  and engineers intended it to be heard  Instrumentation has an extremely high degree of separation on almost every track I�ve listened to  the exceptions being on those recordings that were not great to begin with  And headphones like this allow for one to hear the extra dimension added from the environment where the recording was made  For example  if something was recorded in a small room  you can hear all of the audible nuances that come with recording in that small space  Symphonic music feels rich  huge and detailed  Rock albums feel aggressive and full of attitude  Electronic  jazz  contemporary  industrial�you name it  these headphones faithfully reproduced audio in ways that continually surprised me  This is refreshing  as it highlights the fact that so many consumer headphones add �filler� to their signature  In other words  accuracy of the music is not the end goal  selling a certain kind of sound associated with the headphone is  This is fine if you enjoy one or two particular types of music  but the limits become apparent when you go outside of that box While on the pricey side  the B W P7s are worth every penny  as they are in a class all their own  From the product presentation to the design to the listening experience  the attention to detail is borderline obsessive and
This is a really extension of your iPhone  the more you use it tho more you like it
One of my BEST BUY items   this is a must have item    I can control my whole entertainment system with this one item    unbelievable    Everyone should have a Logitech Harmony Ultimate One universal remote control 
This remote can control all tv and multiple audio visual functions and oh so easy to program
this is my 2nd remote  so if your not use to this remote give it a while  once your comfortable it will be awesome Have them paired with home hubs  so need one paired with each hub 
Reliable for the most part  Touch screen not intuitive  you should definitely experiment  Good battery life but absolutely no indicator of remaining power  As it gets low on battery  will go flaky and just start random actions  But corrects itself when charged  Fairly easy setup once you get right software  I don t recommend you upgrade from prior ultimate setup  very unreliable with provided software  But with fresh install  does well 
Overall remote is pretty modern and fancy  However  for the price  I really dislike where the pause  play  fast forward buttons are located  First  they are at the very top of the remote which makes for an uncomfortable grip if you DVR shows and like to fast forward through commercials  Secondly  the pause  play  fast forward buttons are not prominent enough and I find myself pushing the button immediately below it instead  I would have much preferred these particular buttons were more elevated and located at the bottom of the remote  Otherwise  great features  
Device does exactly what it states it does  Some devices are not supported but still the basics can be done  Instructions are a bit lengthy but informative 
Works easy and Effortless i love it  In my BMW2002
Was looking for a decent replacement for a soundbar  This meets all the needs  Plenty loud with little to no distortion as other low end speakers have 
I compared the xb3 and xb30 side by side and thought the xb3 sounded a little better  The light show on the xb30 is dumb  Only improvement is a  skip track  button  but I still pick the xb3 over the xb30
I can t believe Best Buy still sells these tapes    They work great  they record in HD and the video looks amazing 
I bought this device to use it tethered with my laptop Even though the speed is faster than tethering with my cellphone  the usage was very high which I thought was kinda odd 
This remote works okay and is easy to program but it isn t any where near as nice as the original Harmony 1  It is touchy and the lack of real buttons makes it much harder to just pick up and use  The original Harmony One FF  RW  Pause  Play  etc    buttons where right where they need to be  I m sure we will get used to it but it isn t what we were hoping for 
I ve had difficulty using it away from home  Would purchase again 
Slingbox works  the problem is that it often drops out to the point of being annoying  I have high speed Internet at both my home and my vacation place 200 mIles away  I m able to access my fios account from afar  using my smartphone and Chromecast  Ithe seems to work better at non peak use times  I ll probably keep it  but it is overrated 
Sound it�s ok compare to my Harman Kodon Bluetooth speaker  It�s more connection options  but I could not get the Chromecast to connect with YouTube app 
Sounds great and lights are a plus  but I only get 7 hours of playing time without using lights  And yes I fully charged it before use  I ll give it another week b4 I decide what to do 
Picture is good  However menu to navigate apps is a nightmare and the WiFi is very lacking  Router is next to tv and still weak signle 
Not thorough instructions included for using a 3mm auxiliary jack    could not get stereo to turn on with the jack plugged in  Returned to store to find out that the 2 jacks I were using don t work with that unit even though it is supposed to fit that size jack   unit itself is a little heavy to carry around  Hate the back door compartment has to remain open to use auxiliary cord 
Recommended by an associate  the speaker was inticing and I liked how many connections it could make  WiFi  Aux  Bluetooth  USB    but configuring the unit and working with the web interface and the iOS software has been a nightmare  On top of that  the sound quality is not worth the price at all 
The touch control is erratic there should be a warning when the battery is low I would recommend only for the convenience not the operational status
Worked ok but it gave me conectivity issues  Not worth the price 
Doesnt come with remote hub remote needs to be in vicinity of ir
I got this so I could turn my samsung tv and home theater unit on at the same time with one remote  Has a few things to get used to as it still requires me to chose my tv so I can select my source input  Took 2 tries to get the very slow internet required software to acctualy connect to the remote so it could be programed 
it is fast and seems to work ok  a little hard to use some of the swipe features
I used these headphones connected to my PC via a Bluetooth dongle  95% of the time the sound is great  no issues  The other 5% of the time I had audio issues where I would get what sounded like the Bluetooth dropping out  crackling  scratchy audio  and time distortions where I would lose parts of the what I was listening to or watching and it would slow down or speed up to catch up  When connected to a PC directly via the included cable  sound was great  never any issues  But that isn t what one purchases expensive wireless headphones for Also  the ear cups didn t seem to give enough room  my ears were often sore  and the band across the top of my head always left the top of my head sore because it wouldn t open any more   My head is of an average size  in the Goldilocks zone  not too big  and not too small Brought these back  and upgraded to the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 s  Definitely a little more money  but the difference is night and day 
I thought this was a rechargeable unit that I could plug a regular plug into but found out it was just only good for usb connection 
Product is convenient technology that works for watching football out of the area  Unfortunately it s connection s somewhat temperamental and disconnects occasionally 
it looks good with style  Audio quality is so so to me  maybe I had high expectation 
I like the speaker other than that just doesn t seem to put out quite enough power
These speakers are decent for the price  50 60 a pair is pretty inexpensive for speakers  In the past I ve run 100  pair Polks and Infinity s  The guys at Best Buy were pushing these  told me they d have pretty great bass response when paired with my Alpine deck  I installed them front and rear in my vehicle  I didn t really think the bass was too fantastic  though I haven t ever really been satisfied with the bass output of any of my speakers by themselves  I always wind up adding a sub  Honestly  at first listen  I could tell that these Alpines were a little more tinny  and had a little less presence than my past speaker choices  so I was slightly disappointed  But I should have expected that when I chose to pay less  All of that being said though  these speakers are still a big upgrade from stock speakers  I wasn t unhappy with these speakers  I just could tell that they performed slightly weaker than speakers I ve owned in the past  I still drove this vehicle with these speakers for two years  pushed the stereo pretty hard  loved the sound on a whole  and never had any problems with them  Really not bad for 52
My friend bought this mount and asked me to help him install it  He had a 65  Plasma that weighed 91lbs  This mount says it s ok for this tv and says it ll support up to 125lbs  I install tv s in commercial applications all the time but the mounts I use aren t available in stores and cost about 3 times this mount  I looked at the specifications  at this tv specifications and told him it should be fine  Upon arrival I pulled out the mount  started putting everything together  marked the walls etc and then mounted the back part of the mount  Everything seemed fine  Once we placed the TV on the mount it is apparent the weak point is the bars going across on the top  bottom where the tv attaches  They are super small diameter and provide little support for such a heavy tv  I am ok that the TV isn t going to fall but when you move it around it s super shaky  I viewed the instructions to insure I didn t leave anything off and it s obvious I didn t  I say this mount is fine for any tv under 40  and less than 50lbs but the 125lb weight is says it ll support would scare me  My friend is giving this a day or so to see if he feels safe and we might just pay more money to get something heavier  I don t know why they put such small diameter cross pieces on this especially when the rest of the mount seems reasonable for the tv sizes and weights it is rated for  I guess the final thing to say is you get what you pay for  For a large heavy tv  the mounts I m used to using  Chief  Peerless Omni  are about 400 600 dollars  This one is 1  3 the price but 1  3 the support strength 
Did not have the flexability of past mounts Omni mount
Quality is a little low  If the price was about  35 lower it would be a great deal 
Item is appealing to my teenager because of all the lights  etc   but the sound quality is terrible  Also  don t by into the 1800 watts and believe you are going to shake the house  Not going to happen   
It s ok camera  Night vision is not that good but just to keep on eye on ur house 
Night vision kinda sucks but overall ok camera if just need to see your pet while you re away 
Really loved the Harmony One and wish I still had it  This one has the controls different from any previous model and is going to take a lot of getting used to 
Base does not change very much  Sound not full when out of the store
I got these due to size to fit in my little hot rod and they sound ok but don t sound very  natural   Probably wouldn t buy these again but they re good enough for my application 
Bought them open box  Haven t set them up as of yet 
Bought to connect Bose system and Samsung TV to one remote  It did connect but I lost other features of Samsung remote  I chose to use Samsung remote so returned  Nice remote though 
This product is ok  It has a tendency to repeatttt 
Sound quality is good very stylish only complaint is not as loud as I would like them to be
This computer memory is top notch  A good fit for my computer
rams are pretty expensive atm  bad time for building any pc
Disclaimer  I received this product for free from Best Buy and Sony in exchange for my honest review Oh my gosh  dear Bluetooth speaker  where have you been all my life? I ve always just settled for streaming music through my Apple TV  Insignia TV  my laptop  or my phone   but this little thing is a game changer  The sound is great  the extra bass is great  and the lights are a fun little bonus  The setup took less than a minute   you literally only have to turn it on  and then go to the Bluetooth screen on your phone or device and sync them  That s it  You can control the sound and the song selection from your phone using the volume controls and music app  Sony has a couple of iOS apps you can use  but I didn t bother downloading them  because I will likely just use it to play music in my apartment  Also  the color of the speaker is NOT bright blue like the pictures show  it is basically black  I actually had to look at the paperwork again because I thought I was sent the wrong product  I think I actually prefer the dark blue to the bright blue anyway 
Works very well as long as you have a strong wifi signal or LTE  I love it and im glad i decided to get it  I did alot of research on this from youtube and reviews from other ppl that bought it  You will not be disappointed
Took some time to set everything up  It had some problems with my TV  somehow skipping some inputs when switching modes  but that started working at some point  not sure what exactly I changed   Now everything is fine  as long as I make sure to keep pointing the remote to the devices while it is doing  its thing  which takes longer than normal remotes 
i hav had 3 dell desktops and went to bu my 4th  Had nothing but problems  14 crashes in about a weeks time Best Buy and geek squad were wonderful with taking it back and helping me find a replacement  Bec there were problems with the one on the floor for demos I switched to an HP 
Nice combination of high and lows  I m not a Big Bass fanatic  Plays what I play great  Great for the price 
I used to have the Logitech Harmony 650  which is the best  and it finally died after many years of drops  This new remote was a disappointment for me The buttons are in terrible locations in relation to the touch screen  FFWD  Stop   Play are above the touch screen  which if you have big hands or fat fingers you will accidentally hit the Home button OR the touchscreen   I m going to replace this soon  I gave it 3 months but it just isn t worth the pain 
Fingerprint scanner for that price is not worth it  It s a very good keyboard  but the fp scanner should have been standard 
They are supposed to be top of the line  I blew both speakers after a month and they were replaced under warranty  3 months later another one blew had repaired on my dime  Just blew both again  I have a set of Yamaha outdoor speakers on the same amp and have never blown them and they are 7 years old and cost  79 for the pair  Only problem is I cannot get my money back to buy a real set of speakers 
I didn t like this product  Thought it lacked features for how much it was
I purchased this remote several months ago because I received an email from Logitech offering a  100 trade in on your old remote when you purchase this remote  I starting having problems very soon after setting it up  At first it worked fine but then it wouldn t turn my TV on or off  even if I hit the help button  Worked with customer service and it started working again  briefly  It s been problematic ever since  There s frequently a delay when entering a command  There are several buttons that are dual purpose and really annoying as you have to press and hold the button to get what you want  The power off button is extremely close to the rewind  replay button and the buttons are small  and several times I have turned off my system instead of rewinding  My remote has frozen on me many times  On one occasion I started fast forwarding through a commercial break and when I went to hit play none of the buttons would do anything  I had to grab my iPhone and pull up the app to control my system till the remote decided it was ready to function again  Of course in the mean time my DVR has gone 20 mins past where I wanted to resume watching  The battery indicator is horrible  It has 4 levels  Full  2  3  1  3 or as I call it almost dead  and dead  I ve had it show 2  3 full at bed time and when I wake up the next morning it s almost dead So  what have we learned from my experience? Logitech makes great products  this just ain t one of them 
These are very nice headphones  yes  The problem is  there is a lot of competition out there and these don t particularly emerge as winners by a large extent  They are only marginally better than many headphones available especially in the  200 400 price range  but just not better enough to justify their heinous price tag  Build quality is really good for headphones  but then again  build quality of headphones isn t exactly a very high standard to begin with  primarily since many are concerned about weight and comfort vs  durability I also found the sound to be lacking consistency in each song I played  Some songs sounded brilliant  others mediocre  all depending on the way the music was recorded  I ve know B W to make nearly any song sound amazing in their loudspeakers  despite whatever studio recorded it  These headphones do not continue that tradition  Keep in mind I was using high quality recordings  all at high bitrates and mostly from alt rock and trance genres These headphones are impressive no doubt  but NOT for  400  Maybe more for  100 200  In fact I ve heard better sound from cheaper headphones  sadly I am also not a huge fan of the design  Yes it does look classy  but the design has a certain evanescence about it  like in a few years down the road these things will look rather ugly or odd  Just a bit too strange for my tastes  Borderline hipster  I just want an all around good looking headphone that doesn t have to scream about how different it is by its design Ultimately  I returned them 
I received an email from the woman at the front desk  You have a package up here  I dropped what I was doing  ran to the front  grabbed the box  and gt back to my desk as quickly as possible  Channeling my inner Ralphie Parker  I tore open the box  ripped off the plastic and grabbed a hold of the keyboard  Its a crummy commercial  Much like Raphie Parker being told to drink Ovaltine  I questioned why I bought this keyboard  There is nothing special about this keyboard  Sure  it says its made with Alcantara   and it feels pretty neat   on the outside of the cover  aka the piece that you touch when you carry it   The keyboard itself functions exactly the same  and the inside of the case is the same fabric you would normally have  It has the same chiclet backlit keys  and the same Surface 4 touchpad  It s 30 dollars more to get this slightly silky feeling on the back of the cover  I LOVE the surface tablet  and the keyboards they make for the device are excellent  If you got this keyboard you d be happy with it  but there s nothing about it that says it s worth the extra money 
The unit is difficult to pair and occasionally loses contact  Overall sound is acceptable but not great Not good value for money
Works well  How is it that a company who only does remotes doesnt know that a remote should be operable with one hand  Do you really want to hold a remote and push with the other hand May sound picky until you buy this  Then you will understand  Interface is clunky and nonintuitive 
Hated it used data at 0dd hours of nite an even when unplugged an turned off 
Found myself not really using this anymore  Touch screen is a nice idea  but I ve found that I prefer just remembering where the buttons are so I don t have to look at my remote so often to see what I m pushing 
The fingerprint part works well enough  The trackpad sucks  Coming from the great trackpads on Macs  I just don t understand why a Windows device can t have a nice smooth trackpad like Macs do  The keys are too firm for me compared to the Surface Pro 3 keyboard and my Mac keyboard  I returned this item 
I used the feature to copy settings from a prior device and the new controller did not work properly 
The wife bought this for her tv in her sewing room  The sound quality was not as expected and it made a buzzing sound when the tv was not on 
I thought this was a battery that you could plug in a normal three prong plug into while it was disconnected from the oulet  unfortunately it was not  This design is made so you don t loose a plug while charging the battery  the battery only works when you use the USB ports on top 
Purchased these and immediately went home to try them out  First song I played the bass was rusty and I received a lot of distortion  The bas sounded more like a rattle  The worst part is I wasn t even playing anything that really had any bass in it  Unfortunately the quest for headphones continues  I truly hoped that JBL would have done a better job  These guys will be going back to the store roughly 30 minutes after I purchased them 
I thought this was sling TV  This just let s you get your cable at a remote location 
Screen freezes  not very accurate  needs improvement  I should exchange it as soon as i can 
If your not technical then it will be hard to use this remote
The bass will make it keep moving so that it will eventually keep falling off whatever you set it on  Plus when it falls the side will pop off and eventually break so that they won t stay on making it so the water can get inside 
I bought this to go with my harmony smart hub since it s often dark in the bedroom and the basic remote doesn t cut it especially for my wife  However  I m the only one who uses it  it has more satisfying feel in hand and vibration feedback on screen button hits  but needs a partner hub to do IR  Bluetooth  RF combined  And the layout of the buttons is far worse than the  free  basic remote they throw in with the hub  Also only the screen is backlit so I still need to memorize key positions  This often just stays on the charger  The hubs were 5 star purchases this was a small help  but for the price should really do more  as it s more than the hub and simple remote combined 
For some reason it will not automatically link up after setup  it finally does  but it is time consuming to do this every time you use it
Son wanted it not sure why he is not using it  Found it in his closet along with his XIM connector 
Fine for iPhones but doesnt charge a laptop  No use 
Does what it s supposed to do  Would get another for the kids phones
I purchased the iBN6 a few years ago and she s still going strong  so when I saw this one on sale I snagged  The only problem is I later found some even cheaper  price not quality  speakers and they sounded the same  Nothing that makes it stand out  except the curved look 
The technology freezes and loops  It also fails toporperly set or turn off single devices in sets  This causes you to have to do troubleshooting and a manual fix 
I have used this remote for a while now  The performance is inconsistant  Sometimes it works fine but sometimes it will leave the monitor in the wrong HDMI mode or the audio receiver in the wrong mode  I wish that I hadn t dropped and broken my Harmony One  It was the Ultimate One not this one 
Im very dissatisfied with these speakers I bought  They are the suppose to be very good in the treble and bass spectrum and when I turn on my car system the treble crackles and the bass is barely even noticeable on max other then a annoying vibration that sounds like the speakers blown  But I had the tested at they are just fine My stock 20 dollar speakers are better then these 80 dollar speakers
For 130 bucks do not expect a high fidelity sound however if you keep the volume under 50% you will get a pretty decent sound 
When my wife received her Intel i7 6600k processor she was eager to have her new gaming PC built  We were lacking only one component  RAM  This PNY Anarchy PC4 19200 16GB kit  2x 8GB  was the best option for us that was stocked by our local Best Buy  With the RAM in hand we were able to complete the build and she has been happily gaming ever since with no complaints about the RAM  It performs great and was cmopetitively priced 
This is my second Logitech Remote   This one is not as easy to perform all of the functions the TV  AV receiver  BluRay player and Direct TV receiver attach to it need Find myself reaching for the Direct TV and BluRay player remotes a lot  
I installed this on a PC with Windows 10 64 bit  It would connect and then disconnect from my router over and over  I ended up returning it to Best Buy 
This remote is very easy to setup and works fairly well  However there are some annoying quirks  The touchscreen is very sensitive and it is easy to have button presses that you really did not want when you are trying to scroll  The IR light output is not quite as effective as my older Logitech  My satellite box does not always turn on  off unless you point the remote just right  That was rarely a problem with my older Logitech  The other major annoyance is that this remote does NOT have replaceable batteries  When the rechargeable battery dies Logitech wants you to throw this remote out and buy a new one  Not cool at this price point 
I purchased these because I have a JBL sound system in my Tacoma and it s the best sounding system I ve ever owned  However  these headphones didn t live up to my lofty expectations  I mainly wear my headphones at work and if worn for more than an hour or so  they become somewhat uncomfortable  As for the sound  these don t even come close to Beats  in my opinion  Beats are so much clearer and the base is probably the best out there  I thought that for the price  I would like them much better 
Doesn t use discreet codes  so if you turn the units on  off by using anything other than the remote things will get out of sync  I also have a hard time holding the remote in one hand and comfortably hitting all the controls  The unit isn t long enough to grasp it well and get to all buttons with one hand
Not only is the RAM excellent  but Best Buy price matched Amazon on it  I love Best Buy
Keyboard is nice  well thought out  I spent the extra money to get the cover with the fingerprint feature  Now that i got my surface i turned on windows hello and use the camera mostly  very convenient  When i was using the device as a tablet without keyboard unlocking the device was a chore  With the camera not so much  So now the fingerprint feature lies mostly unused and i probably could have saved some money by getting the regular type cover? Not worth returning though The keyboard is nice  pretty easy to type on  A little flexy when not flat down as i type this review  I am not a great typer  kind of a hunt and peck typer so the fact that it isn t full sized doesn t bother me too much  I just wish somebody would make a magnetic cover that doesn t have a keyboard when i want protection but want to travel light   the screen protectors mostly seem to affect the touchscreen sensitivity based on reviews i read In summation great keyboard  but depending on your security needs the regular type cover might be good enough  Not sure how easy it is to spoof either the fingerprint scanner or the camera  Read an article about researchers using a normal injet printer to spoof fingerprint readers? It is a technology race in the security sector   
I do not like that you have to have an amazon account to download Apps
This radio is great when it will come in  It has very weak reception and it goes off as often as it plays  If you are on a straight road out away from the city  it might work  otherwise not so great 
So far this new remote is taking some getting used to  Navigating the menus is not very intuitive  I initially programmed only a few favorite TV channels  only to learn later that those would be the only channels I could go directly to  I still have to use an old remote to get to other channels quickly  Once there  this remote works OK  Also I don t particularly like the layout of the buttons on this remote  It s apparently not designed for single handed use  All of the most used buttons are near the bottom of the unit and it takes two hands just to mute or change volume settings  I will be programming more channels when I have time 
My friends and I jokingly call my TV the Not so Smart TV as this more accurately describes the product  After turning the TV on  expect at least a 3 minute wait before using any of the TV applications  Additionally  do not expect to receive any help from customer support  I spent an hour and a half on the phone with Samsung  We reset my TV two different ways  the problem persists  and they have done nothing to improve my experience My advice  Buy any other TV  OR  if you re getting this TV  get a fire stick or Apple TV to have a more seamless experience  I wouldn t have bought this monitor for half the price 
My main complaint is the touch screen  Using it to control Tivo playback is really terrible  for instance  you are fast forwarding and then you touch the screen to have it resume play good luck with that  You usually have to tap the screen multiple times before it resumes play  and then you have to rewind and go through the same problem again  It is best at that point to use the physical buttons  The only good thing about this remote is putting your favorite station s icons on the touch screen  Also  I entered the required Tive motel number for the online setup of the remote and when I use the Harmony to turn my Samsung TV on  it not only turns the TV on  but it opens up one of the TV s dialogs automatically  If you decide to use your Tivo or the TV s remote to turn the TV on  but you would like to use the Harmony s touch screen for it s favorite stations  there is no way to do that you wind  up having to turn your TV off first and then having to use the Harmony to turn the TV back on to have access to the favorites on the touch screen 
not for me didn t like the sound to poor and the prices is to high you can jugg or do some weight lifting they gonna fall from your head 
Picture quality was not so great for a 1080P TV  my older Samsung 1080P has a much better picture 
After 4 months  the speaker is not working  Not recommended 
Audio jack is broke  tweeter is sunken into the box  Scratches on case  Item not as described 
We have always bought Harmony remotes and Were very happy with them  However  this remote is a Big disappointment  Not easy to Set up  Not easy to use at all  To much screen swiping to get to the function you want  Screen is too sensitive  Buttons are small and easy to mistress  Not happy with his purchase  I do not recommend 
I ve had them in my car doors for about six months now and sure they got pretty loud and clear with high frequencies  but even with a 80 hz high pass filter  any bit of bass would make them distort  I had them being powered by a PBR300X4  91 RMS watts per channel  4 channels 
For the money it should be easy to use with any stick
I was really excited about this speaker  but unfortunately this is the worst bluetooth speaker I ve ever used  The sound quality is clean and crisp  Has some bass  but not a lot  The issue seems to be it s ability to keep a connection  and the Alexa support  It s very buggy and needs work  Whenever I have my phone paired to the speaker via Bluetooth  then ask the speaker a question using it s builtin Alexa feature  I hear nothing but hiss and static  When I go back to playing music  the sound will be from my phone only  I have to repair the Bluetooth connection  I have to do this every time I attempt to ask the speaker a question  The Alexa feature doesn t seem to work at all  If I ask it a question  I get 10 seconds of hissing noise  They have an Android app  It appears many people are having issues with their app  The rating for their app is quite low  with numerous complaints  I can t recommend this speaker at the moment  Perhaps an update will address these issues 
Not ready for prime time  All the functions work it is just a PITA to use  The screen is slow and way to sensitive  You almost breath on it and a function happens To get tot he FF RW Stop and ply buttons you have to crass the touch screen if you re not careful you ll touch the screen The screen keypad is slow to react and there s no enter button To late to return so it goes on eBay 
This product needs more development  the unit has some nice features but it does not deliver when it comes to performance  if you use the activity buttons   not all of your device functions can be accessed without first switching to the units single device mode  once you have done this the nice functions you had under the activity mode are lost and can not be regained with out switching off all devices and starting over  the set up system works very well so that is nice  I was very excited to get the harmony for Christmas but after setting up the unit twice  I often find it is easier to just use multiple remotes  also the battery life is terrible two days at best  the charging port uses a common usb interface but the width of the area into which you must plug the cord in is narrow making in difficult to use any usb cord different than the on that came with the unit 
I purchased this because of the hurricane coming  Plug my phone in one time and was no longer able to do it because we had no power  Sending it back
not perfect but nearly so  i still have trouble going from my tv with a sony amp and cisco cable box over to apple tv  it doesn t like me to switch even though i turn it off to make the transition  doesn t seem to remember to switch the sony from catv to bd and make again 
I purchased this for my Surface Pro 4  With facial recognition  this makes the fingerprint scanner on the keyboard unnecessary  The  30 difference could be used elsewhere   like towards the external monitor connector 
Not happy at all with this remote  I had the previous model  the Harmony One  and I loved it  Bought one for my sister and my parents as gifts and programmed theirs in addition to mine  Old version was easy to program and use  I mistakenly thought this would be even better  Here is what I do not like about it  and if this is something I programmed incorrectly and someone knows how to fix it  feel free to advise 1  As I said I programmed all the others  so I don t think I am too bad at it  but I have not been able to get this one to work consistently yet  I am always having to use the help button because the TV wont turn on  off 2  Way slower to do all the steps 3  Help button is not right out in the open like it was previously 4  I have not yet been able to figure out how to make the home screen for my roku come up without having to hit the home button  I get a blank screen 5  It does not tell me when the battery is getting low  the old version did  6  Can t figure out how to make the keypad my default home page for TV instead of favorites channels 7  Pretty much every time I update it I have to reset it  it stops halfway through the update There are things I like better though 1  A fix it myself option2  the DVR button brings up my DVR listing  I don t know if that was true before or not Sure wish they would bring back the old model  I d buy it in a minute  I can t see my parents using this one easily so I hope theirs does not break anytime soon 
Not many choices for mobile internet  Nothing wrong with jet pack  just seems slower than my old one  Nothing bad on Best Buys end 
Not happy with this item it doesn t work as well as my old one  I have problems with the touchscreen
Having trouble turning it in on  Geek Squad helped but it still doesn t want to turn on the next day  after being shut off over night  Have to make an appointment at Best Buy to see what s wrong 
I have owned a universal Logitech remote before so I thought I d purchase one again  It was the worst product I ve purchased in a long time  Easy to set up but the functionality on a daily basis is horrible  Everything effects how it controls the tv components  Do you have the curtains open? The sound system doesn t come on  Do you not hold the remote directly pointing at the components for just the right amount of time for the IR signal to hit everything? The tv does not come on  Are you tired after watching a moving and click the off button a little too fast? The cable box doesn t turn off  It was always something  In the end  you spend  260  and you still have all the other remotes sitting on the coffee table so you can grab it after you get tired of things not working  yes  there is a troubleshoot button on the Logitech remote  I think I used the troubleshooting button more then I used the other aspects of the remote  So right now I m happy with the standard Brighthouse remote with a few IR repeaters  For a total cost of  20  Yes  I returned this remote  I returned this one and the second one my boyfriend bought for the bedroom TV  Happily put the over  400 back into the bank 
I can t get the clock to stay showing the time    
This remote was OK   not great   but it did what it was advertized to do  I loved that you were able to turn on all your components with the press of a button  The main problem I had with it was that I am a Tivo user   and there was just way too much lag from when you pressed a button  to when the Tivo would respond  I tried every setting imaginable  but I just couldn t get it to work as good as the actual Tivo remote 
Always messes up and you have to use help to get everything on or off  Not strong on signal  If you are 15 feet away it starts having problems  Touch screen should have been buttons  When applying enough pressure to change fields it enters what you touch  I am really disappointed  Not worth  50 
The stereo was good  except the hands free didn t work well in my car  my car is loud and caused the hands free calling useless
Not what I wanted to use running   working out  It will not stay on with any movement 
this device was no good it is for Direct tv and not over the air ready 
I bought this for an external laptop speaker  It was worse than the speakers in the laptop 
My husband installed it and computer couldn t find it and when he did get to it  the drive kept ejecting on him  Took it back and got and got a 5TB external hard drive  So much better 
I used to have a laptop with a built in wireless network adapter and it was stable  My new computer  at the same position  was not stable and would drop plenty  Online games wee impossible to play  Connection would sometimes drop for minutes at a time  Drivers were an adventure to achieve  Later gave up and bought a long ethernet wire  Expected a lot more from the top of the line network adapter
Not gonna use  Got different car  Would reccommend it
This wall mount does not allow the television to pivot out to more than 30 degrees which means it only slightly pivot from left to right sorry guys thumbs down on that
Bought these to complete a surround system with with the Sony sound bar for my new television  The speakers kept shutting off which was bad enough but each time they shut off they also had to be re paired with the soundbar  Tried following the technical advice of the Sony rep at the store but everything recommended did not work  so back to the store they went  Anybody have any suggestions for a replacement?
Being electronically challenged has made it difficult to use  Hard to figure out all the options  Makes us as seniors a little nervous  Nice having all devices in one remote
If you are over 50  and not tech savvy  avoid this device like the plague  It is counter intuitive  poorly laid out with the worst ergonomics of any remote I ve ever used  The first week of learning its convoluted system was not relaxing and I still use the help program often The battery needs recharge daily  and I use the component remotes because the battery is dead don t put them away 
This very nicely packaged DIMM desktop memory features matched timing over four modules for 16Gbytes of RAM  Just what the doctor ordered for my older machine  but unfortunately  my motherboard is an AMD A3 board  and currently there are no A3 boards that support DDR4 memory  It did not work in my computer  but AMD says they are preparing new DDR4 capable chipsets and processor platforms for later this year  possibly as early as March or April 2016 for the discounters  Until that time  this memory package will only work with Intel processors and the corresponding motherboards  I will retain this set though for the new AMD Mobos later as my graphics work seems to prefer the AMD CPUs 
If you are outside it s not as loud as it should be  Inside it is great  The bass is great as well 
I have loved my Harmony 820 for years and replaced it a couple of times  But when it finally died I was hoping for the same or better in this remote  Wow what a disappointment  I was unsure about the lack of a physical keypad but I figured I d try it anyway  First off the keypad is not the default screen  What Is this supposed to be used mainly with DVD and DVR players Do they think that entering channels is something that most people won t be doing It was easy to set it to the default screen but it doesn t make sense to make me go through that  Then when it is displayed it s slow to react and out of the 10 times that I tried to change to a channel that was not just a single digit 9 of those times it missed one or more of the keypresses  So instead of getting channel 1056 I got 1  16  105 106     you get the idea After about 10mins of playing with it I accepted that it just isn t a very good remote and decided to pack it up and return it  And now that the 800 series are not being made anymore I am at a loss as to what I can do to stop having to use multiple remotes So long Harmony  it was good while it lasted but I guess nothing lasts forever 
A nice little garage setup  Not even close to 2500w but still good for the price  Everything works and works well
I bought these on the recommendation of the store salesman  sounded pretty good in a the store  however they didn t have a lot of bass when I hooked them up  I exchanged them for another brand same price range and they were great 
Wifi connection unstable  Tried 8 8 8 8 dns  worked for a bit only  To get wifi back after turn power off  have to unplug tv  or reset network and reenter password 
I am not pleased with the performance of this remote  It needs to be charged nearly every other day and doe not allow bluetooth connection 
The bass and treble levels were not distinct  My iPhone sounded just as good
Not charging anymore  Thats why they sale it      
Not to big  not to small    holds a charge well   
I m not impressed  I had the previous version of the MiFi mobile Hotspot and don t see any difference  I wish I hadn t spent the extra money because it s no better  I do like the way it works I m a truck driver and it seems to work quite well most of the time 
A must for your surface 4  Works very good keys are responsive and added protection for a screen protector when close  I find the finger print to be some what useless since the surface has face recognition  I got it for the same price as regular keyboard I wouldn t pay extra for it 
there is some ups and downs as installing it physically was easy enough and it showed up in bios but not windows 7 disk mgmt  but with a little knowledge  it was a simple fix   again for the price   buy it
This unit isn t bad for the price  We only use it when we are outside cooking out 
Very complicated but hard to use     Wish the tutorial would go away forever
Im reviewing this as a bedroom TV to watch cable and netflix on  I have not gamed on it  Picture is pretty good just dont expect really inky blacks because its an LED not an OLED  There are a lot of picture adjustment options but its decent right out of the box  Speakers are fine and it was easy to mount  So my only grip with this TV is how long it takes to pick up a WiFi signal when you turn it on  When you turn it off  it goes into a sleep mode of sorts so that you can choose to have it power on with your last used app up and ready to go  Problem is  sometimes when you turn it and and try to start playing internet content right away  it will say you have no internet connection  Reason being sometimes it just takes a while to re connect to your WiFi after being turned off  So the only remedy to this is to just wait until it picks up the signal  My ritual at night is I turn it on  then I brush my teeth so when I come back I know it will be connected and ready to go  I used to try to just turn it on and go right into watching netflix but then it would say no internet connection and ask me if I wanted to troubleshoot  I am on the latest firmware update also  This is your warning 
these are not the best but not the worst  overpriced
Not a bad charger  but it s a little bulky  Charge holds for a while 
The type cover is not too bad looking    i don t like the the velvet like material and it seems a little bit laggy    overall good but not great 
Has some glitches  do not put facing the same way as your receiver
Works nice  i wasnt sure what to expect  i think it was a little pricey but still much cheaper the the 500 

I wish this was louder then it is but it gets the job done
The problem with programmable remotes with IR is you they are only as good as the operator  When using the activity buttons  it can take 10 15 seconds to send all the commands out it needs to  If you don t have the remote pointing in the right direction the whole time then something is not going to turn or switch to the correct input  Not many people like to sit and wait for 15 seconds for anything anymore  Their Companion remote is cheaper and doesn t use IR right from the remote  All that means is when you hit the activity button  it doesn t matter what you do with the remote  The Companion talks to the hub and the hub does all the work  Smarter and more reliable  in my opinion 
not as good as the previous version  harder to use
The sound from this new model is not as the older version that s now discontinued  Does not have that deep bass or sound  Works great however and was awesome at the pool having not to worry about water splashing on it  still not as loud as the older model which is the gray and green model  However I had to return it and search for the older model online  Totally satisfied  Buttons are sturdy and unit is well made to last  I use this at work and sounds great 
I ve used harmony remotes for probably a decade now  and I was underwhelmed by this model  Basic setup is easy enough  but it doesn t seem to reliably apply the settings to all of my devices  Usually this is a problem with the receiver  it doesn t always go to the right input  Advanced setup is no longer intuitive at all  maybe I was spoiled by the earlier remotes software  but this one is definitely more complex  The battery seems to last about a week of normal use  sometimes less  my earlier remotes would go closer to a month On the positive side it does seem to be well constructed  and has survived a couple of drops unscathed  The LED is easy to read  and the button placement is pretty intuitive 
Cost more money and get less would Not buy the same pc  
Previous Verizon Hotspot was stolen  Pretty quick purchase  Even with a external antenna  does not seem to have the reception ability previous one had
This remote is decent  but not as good as the Original One  The button layout is not well thought out  The FF button is at the top above the touch screen  When ever I am using the remote to control my DVR and I fast forward through commercials  my hand hits the touch screen and changes the channel  The work around for this is to scroll off the Favorites screen  bit it s still very annoying 
I ve been using the same Logitech Harmony One for the last 5 or 6 years now  and it s great  despite the bloated battery issue   Last year when I read the Harmony One was to be discontinued  I bought another One  just in case my current one dies  I m glad I did  because now the Harmony One is selling for twice the price I paid last year  if you can find one While the Harmony One wasn t exactly simple to program  it s a lot easier that the Ultimate  I wouldn t say the Ultimate is difficult to figure out  but it s not as intuitive as the One  and the One isn t very intuitive    For someone going from a One to the Ultimate  you ll certainly be frustrated and disappointed  You may grow to love it  but you ll always long for the One 
I spent a lot of money on this and it has a lot of flaws  but it also has some great features Like * Every one of my devices I have it knows about  and has detailed configurations for* It has a nice programming interface that almost anyone can use  You drag and drop actions into a sequence for each of your desired functions like Watch TV* It has long battery life and is rechargable* It wakes up when it detects it s been picked upDislike * Programming interface forces you to start with a base set of commands for some actions and you cannot add pauses between them  My devices need pauses so I had to do some wonky workarounds to get the devices sequences to work as required * It assumes you are always starting from a specific state  e g  all devices are powered off  If one of your devices is on  then when it sends the power signal the device turns off instead of on  and then you are in a funky state and you have to send your devices a command to power everything off  manually toggle that one device and then start all over again * DON T change the settings of a device without using the Harmony remote or again you will get into a wonky state and it gets confused  because it only knows the last state it told each device to be in * I know how to work around these idiosyncrasies  but it confuses anyone else trying to use it and frustrates the daylights out of my wife 
overall good buttons are too small  sound goox
I want to love this remote  but I just can t  We got this for a great price and I debated on keeping it or not and finally decided to keep it  It is OK  but not near as good as the Harmony One in my opinion  The touch screen is a great idea  but really easy to hit things that you do not want to because it is right in the middle of the remote  I think it would have made more sense to put it at the top and have all the fixed buttons at the bottom like the Harmony One and then you would not have to reach over the touch screen to get to some frequently used buttons and accidentally hit the touchscreen  The layout of the buttons also does not seem as intuitive as older harmony remotes in my opinion and maybe that is more because I am used to the older layouts  Maybe if you are new to Harmony with this remote it would not be as big of a deal or noticeable for you I also do not like that the bottom of the remote is curved so that it will rock from side to side with only a slight touch or movement when on a table or TV tray  I think it only hit the deck once so far and it did not cause any damage  but it is a significant concern  with hard floors  when you have a remote this expensive  All the other Harmony remotes that i have had did not have this issue  One  880  670   It may be of no concern if you have plush carpeted floors I did like that the newer harmony software would automatically have all the channels available to pick favorites and it puts the icon for network on the touch screen  This was pretty slick and in older remotes there was no easy way to do this I also do like that the charger puts the remote vertical and takes up a much smaller footprint  It is also much easier to see if the remote is in the charge from across the room  The thing i do not like  is I feel the battery life is much lower than either the Harmony One or the 880  both discontinued   I have to charge it much more often 
A disappointing gift  Does not work well with our sound bar and can not defeat the automatic shut off feature  Neither could Brian from the Geek Squad 
Signing in to get a hot spot is a pain and then keeping this charged is also inconvenient  I prefer the hotspot on the phone and will be going back to that  The only advantage to this was that it had room for 10 devices 
These speakers were not easy to set up and still don t work as they should 
To start  I take partial responsibility for purchasing an item that may not be the most suited for my needs  That said  logitech makes it a nightmare to sort between the different harmony options available  Only now do I know that there is a better option available  This remote is RF and will not work well with closed cabinet set ups  Spend the extra bucks and get the wifi enabled remote  In addition to that  the battery life isn t great  so if you have your tv set up in a room with a poor configuration for a plugged in remote cradle to inconspicuously be available at all times  then look elsewhere  Programming the remote is not nearly as simple as I was lead to believe by the guy I spoke with in Best Buy  The fast forward and rewind are a little finicky and do not always work  and they are not placed in the most accessible location at the very top of the remote The pros for this model are that it is relatively easy to use once all of your devices are programmed  no easy feat   It s light in your hand
The SP4 keyboard is largely improved and the clickiness of the keys is definitely something I appreciate  Overall  a great typing experience  keys are well lit and spaced for comfortable typing  While the fingerprint reader does add an extra layer of security and  future proofness   it doesn t otherwise add large improvements  Windows 10 has facial login that you ll likely use more often than this  But having the finger print reader can be handy  If the extra few bucks doesn t matter to you  why not?
This product was advertised as new but arrived used 
We wanted an all in one remote to use for all of our devices  My husband did the research which showed this one to be the best  After using it for 6 months we completely disagree  The ergonomics of the remote aren t right  the screen on it gets touched accidentally all the time causing problems  and its difficult to switch from one device to another  Would return it if we could  After paying that much for a stupid remote we will have to think long and hard about wasting that much money on another one 
I had a Harmony 880 that I loved and used to control TV  sound system with audio inputs and a WDTV media device  Had it programmed for TV viewing  media streaming both from WDTV and Amazon Fire TV Stick  radio  audio input from mp3 player and audio input and monitor from computer  The 880 was great with display screen and physical buttons  After a times thru display was unnecessary just pick the buttons for what I wanted to do  After nearly 5 years the buttons finally wore out and I replaced it with this one  I was able to transfer all my devices and most of my activities from the 880 after finally digging up the password for Harmony device web account  Much of the control was transferred from physical buttons to touch screen which seems a bit tricky to control  I have not had it long enough to see if I can reprogram buttons for activities to regain some the functionality of old remote  Even if it can be programmed to us the buttons seems like it will still require a lot of looking at the remotes screen rather than keeping my eyes on the big screen  But I guess that s progress and soon there won t be buttons or screen just speech and then brain wave scan which will be replaced with a logarithm based on our habits and what we did in the past that was selected by a logarithm  I miss the days were I could just push a button repeatedly until ran across something interesting 
too sensitive to touch  don t like that customer support runs out after only a month and very expensive 
I wish i could give a better rating  The sounds is not as good as i expected  I have to say that it was easy to install and it is very light weight  I have some problems with the wifi because it does not keep the connection or the password  On a daily basis  almost  I need to reenter the long password provided by carrier  There should be some kind of memory available for the password 
Was duped visiting the store by a Sony rep  who convinced me its the best sound for the price  Gullibly  and without doing due diligence  I bought it to use with my Alexa  The speaker does not stay powered on  even if plugged in to a power source  So  any time you want to use it after period of dormancy  you have to physically push the power button  Second issue  bought a Peleton bike  so figure I ll use this speaker for that instead  I got a Bose to use with Alexa  The Sony drops it s Bluetooth connection constantly  very irritating  I went to support  did factory reset  nothing  My bad  again  passing the return deadline  so I m stuck with this lemon  In the time being  I bought a Bose Soundlink 2  works like a charm  My Harmon Kardon also works beautifully  I love Sony products  but NOT THIS ONE 
When changing channels Does not respond quick when pushing buttons have to press many times to get the command you want 
Jbl 700 elite first pair I bought  one of the speaker distortion present  Return got a second pair plastic bridge on top crack present  Return and got dre beats studio  Satisfy happy with dre headphones 
If you can  go for another brand  here is why 1 It has a very weak bass  not what SONY claims at all  the case of the speaker itself is of such thin plastic that makes the speaker just shake instead of sending the bass into the room or space 2  if you want a multi room system out of these speakers  it becomes very expensive  much more than a dedicated system like SONOS  and is becomes complicated  needing to buy a WIFI router and trying to piece all the components together with SONY s Songpal  I tried it and got frustrated with the App  3  the SONGPAL App  now called Music   is clumsy and works sometimes  and sometimes it does not  To make the speakers work with WIFI instead of Blueatooth you Must use a Router that supports WIFI PROTECTED MODE  otherwise you are stuck with Bluetooth only  meaning One speaker at a time  not stereo  or multi room THE BIGGEST DEFEATER   ITS VERY POOR BASS  WEAK SOUND   
This is a keyboard that will not wash your dishes  moisturizer your skin  or fertilize your lawn  It s a keyboard and it has a nicer feel than the original  The fingerprint reader works very well  It can also be used as a trivet for a hot roasting pan     Once  
These look GREAT  I love the LED bar around the face  I am connected to the AUX in jack and to power all the time as it is at work  and it lowers the volume on its own during songs off and on all day   then it will power off for no apparent reason  I have 30 days to take it back and will be taking it in tomorrow 
First off I m married and have 3 kids  9 4  2   So things can get loud   crazy  But after my work injury concussion  I was having horrible sensitivity to noise  They are comfortable  the battery charge last quite a while  and like I said the noise canceling is amazing 
Power lasts forever  Just know you have an extra  20 on your bill for fees 
So so  doesn t always work when pointed at my receiver or to turn on the TV  No support for blue tooth to control ps4 like mentioned online  So I still need to use multiple remotes 
Be aware that there is no service on any Harmony unit after the warranty expires  Heres a quote from the answer to my request for service Unfortunately  Logitech does not offer repair services for out of warranty products  including Harmony remotes  nor can I recommend any repair shops that work on our products Ian CroweDirector  Customer ExperienceLogitech Harmony Remotes
Quite simply  the best combination of design  build quality  comfort and sound quality available  Once you have had a chance to have them in your hands  and on finally on your head  you will forget the price you paid  The comfort is that good  The sound quality is that good 
My wife picked this out for herself after finding another and returning to Amazon because it had a cheap feel to it  She loves this one  It s very sturdy and not cheaply made at all 
Lowest    Gb DDR4 available at the time  No issues  so far   
I purchased a 66 inch Samsung TV for Christmas and had it professionally installed with the Sanus mount  The installer did not have a problem  I like the feature that allows me to change the angle of the TV in relation to the room and so far it is still holding the TV up there stoutly  The kit included extra hardware that was not applicable to my situation so it will have to disposed of  Ask me again in a year if I still like it 
It could be my camera  but after re using ANY BRAND mini dv tape many times I start to get an occasional single staticy audio squeak and if i look at the tape right there it is slightly crinkled on the edge  It is probably my camera  I have a Sony PD 170 
Great product  Easy to use  No problems  Would certainly recommend
Received item and came is as described  No issues 
Works ok but it does not have number buttons  No number buttons might seam like a small issue but you cannot go directly to a channel without taking several steps to bring up the numbers on the touch screen  Try changing channels with out staring at the screen  That does not work 
I had a N adapter and was losing connections after Comcast replaced my router with newer one  I bought this and have not had one drop 
This was purchased last minute for a build for my brother  RAM has worked flawlessly so far
had to take it back  would not work with my T V nothing else to say
This is not at all what it was made out to be  Not at all worth the money  My little Bluetooth portable speaker sounds way better than this thing  The functions are horrible to switch back and forth  when you flip the power switch to �off� it makes a horrible �pop� sound and sounds like the speakers are going to blow  I would not waste a penny on this unit    save your money and donate it to a good cause or something 
I have this head unit mounted in a motorcycle fairing  Unfortunately  I also have experienced the issue with it randomly changing volume  depending on the vibration level  music and  or engine  of the fairing at any particular moment  Other than that  it s an excellent receiver with a tuner that locks in distant FM stations where others have failed  Kenwood KMRM312BT   I ll be trying the JVC KD X33MBS this time around  Hopefully  the third time is the charm  I m getting awfully tired of buying new stereos every six months    
I used this RAM to double the RAM in my IMAC  as well as installing a SSD drive  after the upgrade  I hade no substantial increase in speed  This is not to say that there is no benefit  only no speed increase 
Absolute GARBAGE  I had the previous Sony unit that I purchased from West Marine  When the blue tooth went out I took it back under warranty and this was supposed to be the upgrade  Sound settings are all presets and there is no way to customize Trebil  Miss and Lows  I don t like being forced to listen to their presets  My stereo now sounds flat and Low  No where near the high sound quality should I should be getting  I am running 8 Marine 6x9 and a RockFos 10 inch Sub on a JL audio 8 channel Marine Amp  Not happy at all  
I have had a Harmony One for years  The touch screen stopped working recently  so I ordered this  They say the settings from the Harmony One can be imported    Well  the activities were imported fine  but none of the customized buttons on the One can be imported  This represents a MAJOR loss of functionality since those buttons were practically all I used on the remote to change settings and launch programs  etc   What a pity  The ultimate one is going back  Hey  and guess what    I had to plug the old remote in and set up a sham device with customer support over the phone to add the new remote to my account  where s that at   Anyway  the touch screen started working again after I did that  So I set up my old remote again and am back in business  If it goes out again I will be starting fresh with another company  Shame on you  Logitech 
Easy to install  Does what its supposed to do  Good price  No complaints 
Works as advertised on the website we are working on the net now 
The speakers blew really easy didn t even have them super loud 
This speaker sounds much bigger than it actually is probably one of the best speakers I ve ever owned
Fairly easy setup  Was able to set so it gives me important information  but not going off for every little thing  Like it a lot 
The remote feels good my hand  Good thing that it can be programmed for a bunch of station presets  because to get to the manual number input screen is about 3 screens deep  The lack of a permanent number pad contributes to a very contemporary appearance  But  if you find that you forgot to program one of your favs  you may end up like me  searching for the component remote to access my channel number and put off programming the Ultimate until a later time Fortunately  when I do get time to do the programming  it is super easy with the Harmony on line tool

If you re looking for the best set of phones that your average Magnolia Best Buy sells  this is it  I ve purchased the Sennheiser Momentum M2 and the V Moda M100  These are the best all around headphone  I do think they re a bit pricey for what you get  but Best Buy is easy 
I purchased and installed this myself in a 2005 Saturn L300 that still had the all original system  which sounded terrible  I thought my speakers needed replaced  too  but after hooking up this new unit  they sound almost 100% better  For the features and sound quality you get with this unit  it is a great deal  I love that I can plug in my iPod classic to the USB  and use the receiver s controls for it  Very handy when driving  I debated whether I wanted a unit with CD player capability  but decided I d rather pay a little less and do without  I rarely  almost never  use CDs anyway This unit was quite simple to wire up  using the metra harness and dash kit Had a little trouble figuring out how to link my android phone with Bluetooth  but realized what step I was missing  Now it works like a charm Love this media receiver for the price 
For the money it is a great product  The sound quality is better than others at the same price  What I do love is u can be more than 100feet away and it still works  Oh bonus it s waterproof  
if it was used  it doesn t seem like it  It is great shape and worked straight off the bat with no issues 
We like that we can move the tv in different directions  Although I don t believe calling it  full range motion  is exactly accurate  it does move enough to suit our needs 
Great product very easy to follow instructions  It s not a bulky item and mounts easily to wall and television 
Love having our TV mounted on the wall and like the flexibility that this product gives  We can pull it out a bit  tilt it up or down and side to side  It works perfectly 
Needed an upgrade from my Logitech 650 that the buttons stopped working after 10 years so I decided to upgrade to the ultimate one because of the touch screen  love it the favorite screen makes channel surfing a breeze  Nice charging cradle too
This was purchased as an upgrade from a Surface Pro 3 type cover  The spacing and style of the keys on the new model is far superior to the Pro 3 cover  The larger touchpad is a plus  much better than the original  The fingerprint reader works intermittently  disconnecting the keyboard and reattaching it will usually  jar  it back into functionality 
I had to replace a very dependable Logitech remote after my kid sat on and spiderweb ed the display screen  Kinda glad he did because the Harmony Ultimate is much more robust and reliable compared to the older model  Set up and programming is much simpler now that it s done over the web  The touch screen favorite channels are easy to program and arrange The Activity  macro programming  i e  controlling multiple devices to  Watch a DVD   operate solidly  I m really enjoying this new model 
Perfect upgrade for iPhone users  Easy use and looks great 
At about 150  this is a good value for a universal IR remote  Button layout is a little odd with the play  stop  etc  buttons at top and touch screen is a little slow  at least compared to phones and tablets  Charging dock is nice NOTE that this remote will NOT control devices over RF  e g  Roku players  or Bluetooth  e g  Playstation   That functionality requires a separate 100 hub  which can also be extended to control Zigbee and other types of IoT devices  approximately another 100  NOTE that this remote requires a computer to set up  otherwise it is just an expensive paperweight  Be sure to check the OS requirements  Also requires downloading software from Harmony  which went without a hitch once I disabled my VPN  For some reason it refused to download the program files on the VPN and gave the usual check that you are connected to the Internet advice  Turned out to be half right Setup was easy  Will consider getting the hub to control non IR devices Arrived quickly and nicely packed  So far so good    
This remote makes it easier to control all devices  Only downside is no radio frequency for this remote 
The keys seem great  The fingerprint recognition generally works but not always   Could just be my fingerprint   I like the way the keyboard just clicks to the surface pro 
I had my old Logitech Harmony remote 9 5 years  The buttons  non touch screen  started to give out  I bought this new model recently  I still have my same thoughts from last time  Doesn t seem like they care about ergonomics at all  The most commonly used buttons are at the bottom making them hard to use  It is even harder to use the pure touch screen buttons  as opposed to a touch screen for instructions while hitting an actual button out to the side of it   To only be able to page up  down with the pure touch screen is almost impossible  To touch the correct choice while holding the remote out in front of you is quite the feat  To only be able to hit numbers on a pure touch screen to key in a specific channel is even harder  Again  it is the  usability  not the performance that lacks
We re using this with a 70  Sharp Aquos TV  It s very sturdy and easy to move around when necessary 
The stand was a real pain to put together  The screws did not want to go in but eventually  we managed  The picture and sound are very good  Can t really beat the sale price  Overall  quite pleased with the purchase 
Has a good pic  clear  Color could be better  Manual would be great  Cannot even find on  off for the TV
I just ordered this tv and unless I am doing something wrong I cannot access the smarthub inthe same manner that I see other people using it on videos   I am under the impression that the 5 Series tv I ordered  UN32M5300AFXZA  has an older version of Smarthub and although I did a factory reset of the tv my issue was not resolved  I see people accessing their Smarthub simply by pressing a button on their remote but my remote doesn t have a Smarthub buttom and I ve downloaded an app that has it but I cannot access it   Clearly this is not the Samsung tv that comes with Google Play that would make this so much better and user friendly  I have tried everything to attempt to download an app or game but it seems as though that must ve been on an older model tv   Nice tv nonetheless and the picture is amazing just can t figure out how to update the firmware or download apps from Google Play if this is even possible
Without a doubt  it is a nice TV  BestBuy com lists the width of the TV as 36 3 inches wide  It is over 39 inches wide  I took the doors off my entertainment center to make it fit and plan to keep the TV  but I will probably double check any information off the Best buy web site in the future 
Good tv   Does everything I want it to very nice picture  
Very nice tv for the price  Would defjjtely recommend no problem so far  So worth it
Works great for smaller rooms and with the right wall mount is even better 
Works well  Sharp picture  Easy to use
This is a nice travel bag  I like the fact that the storage access is on the backside for extra security  This isn t a carry all your gear type of bag  it s more of a take what you will only use and nothing more type of bag  Built well and worth the money 
Easy to use and nice not needing to use more then one remote control
Very nice remote  and when it works  it is terrific  When it was first programmed  it was a bit glitchy  like it needed a break in period If we have a power surge  it tends to lose itself  but the self healing Help function is great  Once I found it  life was good Where you touch  and how is important  Found out that fingers don t work as well as thumbs when selecting Watch TV  etc 
Now I Dont Have To Worry About Dont have my cable chargerBecouse i got the portable charger
I caught these on a  mega sale   Went ahead and got 4  Love them as an upgrade over factory speakers 
Nice  but not as bright as I thought they would be
Sound good nice balance of bass   treble quality sound love it    
I had these speakers installed in the ceiling as part of a kitchen remodel of an older home  The speakers are powered by a Sonos Amp  perfectly sized   and both look and sound great 
These speakers are so wonderful they give me the sound I was looking for nice and smooth
I purchased this speaker as a Christmas gift for my fianc  If you are looking for a small speaker to use  it meets that criteria  The speaker is reasonably priced  There is no pouch or carrying case that comes with the speaker  The speaker produces a nice sound  It is not an  high end  Bluetooth speaker  but it delivers a welcomed punch  The challenge with this speaker is that it may not connect with all devices  at least this is what I experienced  I had a couple of MP3 players that it did not connect with  My fiances phone  Samsung Note 5  would pair  but would drop frequently  I did get it to pair with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet  So  there may be some pairing issues with some devices  However  if you are able to get it to pair  you will enjoy the sound  I will keep the speaker since it works with my tablet  but  I will search for another one that pairs more easily with various devices  If you decide to buy  just be mindful that it may or may not pair or pair smoothly with your device or devices

the speaker isn t big but it has great sound it will work well for me 
I m happy with this speaker  It has nice bass for the size and good overall sound  It s water resistant and I really like the built in USB ports for charging your phone  It also has a great battery life 
Nice volume nice size had ordered diff speaker shipment didn t arrive  chose this one on shelf real pleased
Good sound from speaker and good distance for Bluetooth for price
This baby is a gem  I was really hesitant on purchasing this speaker based on the negative reviews but I m glad I bought it anyway  I love the sound that the speaker puts out  it s pretty loud and bass is also   I love the fact of being able to control the speaker with the SongPal app  I don t connect it to other speakers  yet  to have that surround sound effect so I don t use it via WiFi  I was torn between this and the Google speaker but the fact that Google doesn t support bluetooth helped make my mind up  The only  complaint  I have is the battery drains faster than I like and it doesn t charge well if you re using it  At 10% the volume automatically decreases so I have to always turn the speaker off to get a full charge quickly 
Was on sale  nice sounds for size  every one like speaker
Owned for a year and a half  Great sound  Has some bells and whistles  2 complaints  The CD insert  player is very slow at reading and loading  And secondly  its a bit overpriced  in my opinion 
I love it all around the sound is great the size is just right so it s out the way
I bought this instead of dedicated speakers for my desktop  choosing to pair it through Bluetooth instead  Its everything ill need for anything i ll ever do on my computer  but is also portable and easy to switch to being paired with my phone  for going out  My 3yo niece and I both love the lights too 
I use this speaker with android phone and it gives great volume to my music 
I wanted something I could wear while laying down on a couch or bed  If you lay your head on a pillow these are not very comfortable 
I have installed 2 pairs in my mustang with a new head unit and these speakers sound great  No complaints from this guy  
I checked out several Bluetooth chargeable small speakers before I chose this one  It sounds great  I like the added bass feature  I use it all the time  Connecting to the Bluetooth was super easy 
Like the way it pairs up to my sound bar  Wanted Surround sound and got it 
nice sound for listening to music from phone on my patio
Works great with the sub that I have installed in my truck 
Our college student daughter likes the quality and size of the speaker 
I do like component speakers but these had to due in a pinch  It has nice punch in the bottom and good sounding tweeters without the separation a component would have  It does seem better to have an amp attached with this  My Alpine head unit is not used to so low an ohm rating 
We bought this when our Harmony one  previous model  finally bit the dust after having been dropped too many times  This one is smaller and lighter  and gives a small vibration when a selection is made to indicate a successful selection  It stands up on the charger  which is nice because it takes less space on the table  I don t love that there are no physical number buttons on this one  however  You have to swipe to get to the number pad  which is a little annoying Overall  good replacement for our old one 
Nice remote  Works good Things I don t like  touch screen should be at the top  The controls at the top are used a lot and it s awkward to use them Also if the screen was up to you wouldn t need the swipe to unlock because you wouldn t accidentally touch the screen  I tried to turn it off but then I found myself accidentally touching it  They really screwed up with the touch screen location  It almost makes me want to change my review to 3 stars When you use a macro and something doesn t turn on  you should be able to use that macro again  Instead you have to go into menu and go to device and then correct the problem  I understand why they did that but it would be easier to run the macro again Doest allow you to control volume from multiple devices  Example  I use my recieved for volume so most of the time it isn t an issue  But I like to let the kids watch Netflix through the smart TV and it won t allow you to use the TV volume after you told it you use the receiver for volume in the setup screens Things I like Nice feelSlimI like the favorites in the screenUpright chargerWorks good 
Nice remote  Battery life is not as long as I would like  Sometimes a little fussy but still nice 
The remote works well  The online setup was a breeze even if it didn t download the profile from my old harmony remote  The setup was faster than my original remote  I wish it had the number keys like my old harmony one  but I m getting used to the favorites icons on the touch screen  Overall  a solid remote 
Nice remote  now learn how to use it  Love the fact can re charge on stand  no batteries  
Touch pad is nice  but very sensitive  You can drop remote on the carpet   it might change your whole setup because of the sensitivity of the touch screen 
Best feature is being rechargableWorks nice  touch screen is a nice feature alsoWorks with everything I have but my PS3
Does a good job of integrating remotes  Does not tell you that the functions dont sync with the hub  have to get next model up for that   Works fine but the alexa functions can be wonky 
Remote was very easy to setup  Using the remote to control receiver  DVD  TV and Tivo  Coming from the Tivo remote takes some time to get used to  but haven t found any loss of functionality so far 
this remote does a good job of replacing other remotes   but it is very sensitive to touch and the buttons are somewhat small   overall  I like it 
I like the remote  It does not have to be pointed directly at the TV  DVR  Blu ray to operate  I even went upstairs and tried it there to see  and it still worked  Several options available  The only downside is the TV channel number buttons don t always work properly  but I was able to set up the stations I want to watch so it s not been that big a problem 
I m used to having buttons to push  model 650    so it takes a little getting used to the touch screen  but aside from that this is a very nice product   Nice features  easy to program and navigate happy with my purchase 
I picked these up for my son s rig  Bought these to replace some Corsair ram that would cause random bsodstuff  Swapped these in and my son s a happy camper now  Good price and was in Stock at my local store 
Good product with good sound  Wish some of he buttons and functions were easier to operate without the remote  Otherwise no other conplaints
It has bluetooth and a remote  it s loud  good buy
Radio sounds good  Bluetooth connection is great  Can make calls and answer calls from radio and play your music from your phone  No cd player but with the bluetooth you dont need it  Great replacement radio 
The Sanus was pretty easy to install but you really have to know how to measure  The quality and functionality is awesome though 
Bought this to replace my Harmony 650  Still has the same issues as the 650 with changing the inputs on my Samsung 3D Blu Ray home theater system but I like this remote more  The charging dock feature was a huge plus  no more batteries to buy  The remote looks nice and matches any black home theater setup  I read the reviews before I purchased and the issue of inadvertently activating the touch screen is resolved via the firmware upgrade  The screen is locked until you swipe to unlock  In closing I do highly recommend the Ultimate One despite still having to use the HELP button for many of the activities 
compared this to ultimate ear megabox and bought this product  has very nice sound with good features  a little heavy in the bass even without the bass boost  you can turn off the lights  i found them a little annoying  long battery life  does not charge through a usb  uses a charger supplied with product  good and solid item
for the money  I don t think you could find a better portable bluetooth speaker  Nice full sound and good range 
I love being able to  watch  my home cable from anywhere with a Wi Fi connection  Wish box had a hdmi connection 
It does everything it is supposed to do    nice  I really like the choice I made 
It has good battery life  It cold b a little louder
It is good size and very good performance and it is very good for the price
It s a great product great compatibility and easy to type keyboard 
This is a nice remote product  It is easy to program  The list of devices supported mine  I found it nice to put in my hand  I liked it  All in all  I am happy with this purchase 
This product serves the purpose for which it was purchased 
Price is nice but this is not the best picture I have seen on a Samsung 
I chose this one based on price  I ve had other Toshiba drives in the past  and their return policy is odd  but it worked out OK This drive runs hotter than the 2TB Seagate that it replaced  so you should be aware there will be about a 5 degree Celsius difference in heat output  This drive is also louder than the Seagate The drive arrived as expected  It functions well  There were no cables nor screws included  so this is bare bones 
I love this Sony XB 30 portable speaker  I have used it several times now and it lasts hours on a single charge  The sound quality is very good and the bluetooth feature allows me to use it in places where I can t access an outlet  The dancing lights are a nice feature but not something that is important to me 
The speaker sound is great and hooks up easily to Bluetooth and I pod The volume controls have to be pushed down for a few seconds to work  other than that it s great  Very portable  will be great for camping 
The Belkin Portable Charger is a nice item to have when camping or when you lose power at home 
I bought this on the recommendation of my sister  It is a nice slim size  I just wish it charged my phone more  only charged my phone to under 75%  I thought with the specs being alot more than my old one it would charge it full
I really like this item  It is a cheaper and easier option instead of buying an internal network card for my computer
I prefer the sound over the Beats Studio I gave my daughter  Plus these are bluetooth as well 
I upgraded from a Harmony 650 which I liked a lot  I bought this so I could control both my upstairs and downstairs entertainment centers  The touch screen works well and you can use the touch screen for some commands     pause play  FF  etc  Easy to do the INITIAL programming with the Harmony software  ISSUES  a charge only lasts two days  good news  it only takes about an hour to recharge  I loaded my favorites on the remote and was looking forward to being able to choose from the remote instead of pulling up the Dish Network Menu and scrolling     Unfortunately  you can only use the favorites on the first  watch TV  setting  If you try to use them on the second  Watch TV  setup  it turns off half of the equipment instead 
I never knew a mouse could cost so much  it is well worth the money  so far so go 
Was easy to install and works great  Improved the performance of my laptop
Put this unit in my 27 bowrider replacing an older Sony unit  The unit is much smaller in depth due to the lack of the CD player  It has a wiring harness with all the leads marked by color coding for what position  front  back left  right  and polarity  I can see the display just fine in the sunlight so no problem there  I paired it with 4 Infinity marine speakers and the DSXM55BT drives them well  Cranked up I can here the music while underway  The Bluetooth connects well with no issue and radio stations tune in clear  Overall  I feel this is a real nice unit for the money  installed easily  manual is straight forward and once you get the hang of the controls  menu it s fairly intuitive  My only complaint is when I shut the batteries off on the boat the unit loses its presets  but it s fairly quick to re memorize them with the 6 preset buttons and that is not the fault of the unit  I would have no problem recommending this unit and it does have pre outs for an amp if needed to expand or add a bass speaker 
I had contemplated building my own machine   but Bestbuy had this  200 off for  829  It is very fast rwith the kaby lake i7   It has a combination of USB 2 and 3 ports and USB C port  I ve yet to use the USB c port as of yet   I plan to install a 4tb drive as  A data drive in one of the open bays  As I have replaced the 1 tab drive with a Samsung 960 evo nvme ssd  Getting used to Windows 10 since I m mainly a Mac OS guy  I like that windows 10 recognized my canon wireless printer via bonjour As an added bonus the desktop dropped an additional  80 within my return period and bestbuy customer easily credited me the difference Outstanding value and price
It works pretty well with my equipment  I love the fact that it has a charging base  so no more batteries for me  
Use it in my home office   like the fact that I can use Bluetooth or wifi 
I ve been wanting to get a small blue tooth speaker to use with my phone  tablet  etc  and finally did to for a meeting  We were in a large room with about 15 people  The sound volume and clarity was very good  even for those who wear hearing aids  Happy with my purchase 
Being able to test these speakers in the store really made this decision easy  I wanted something mainly for the garage and mainly for talk radio  podcast listening  With the bass boost turned off  this sounds great  if maybe still a little too bassy  and music sounds amazing without it too  The big name  heavy bass brand of wireless speaker still has way too much bass even with the boost turned off  The other options available from Sony   WiFi  and the phone feature  sealed the deal 
Surprised by the performance in this little speaker  I m glad I bought it
The fingerprint feature is awesome  Light  flexible keyboard 
It s an ok keyboard the fingerprint ID is nice but it s thin so when your typing fast it feels weird  The only other thing is the outside is suede 
Bought with the Surface Pro 4  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I am not sure why it is not included with the computer  Absolutely required for the Surface Pro
Attached easily and firmly  Has a nice feel  A must with the Surface Pro 
Great upgrade from my previous surface pro 3 keyboard  The fingerprint scanner is a bonus 
Nice keyboard for surface tablet that can be implemented as needed 
Nice keyboard  Works every time  Fingerprints cool 
Works very fine with fingerprint apart from the rest of the features
We had an older Logitech remote that was programmable through their web app  The puppy decided he liked the remote better than we did  and although it still worked after the application of some CSI style  crime scene reconstruction forensics and super glue  it was time for a new remote now that he had grown up This remote and the computer based app is remarkable  If you can follow simple directions  the application walks you through each step  I write instruction and repair procedures  and I can tell you that the instructions in the app make it easy to get the remote working how you like  well done  Logitech You Begin by entering the brand and model number of each device  On one of the older devices it gave a screen message that there are control variations with that model and to consult them if there was a problem  It also popped up that the Roku was IR and RF and that this remote was only IR  It even handled an old VCR and a not quite as old DVD recorder  Ya    we re old  So whatOnce all your devices are entered you create Activities  For example  for watching TV we use our receiver  the LCD TV and the antenna  It even asks if we wanted the Onkyo or the TV to control the volume and what input on the TV to use for this activity and what input on the receiver  I was easily able to create an FM activity to listen to the radio in the morning  With dreary morning eyes  just we only have to press the FM screen icon in the activities window on the touch screen Additionally  I created two custom activities  one for watching HULU and one for watching NETFLIX using our Roku3  I was able to customize it so that the remote would start the TV  Start the Onkyo  and select the Roku  At that point it sent the signals to emulate remote key selections for HOME  Click Right  click Right  OK to get to Hulu  I did much the same for Netflix  I found that these two custom Activities would not go back and forth between the two  The solution was to add a two second delay between HOME and go right  The app made that easy as one of the custom items which could be selected in the app was ADD DELAY and you can select the length of the delay as well  Handy for troubleshooting should it become necessary  The custom items  such as the button presses  can be reordered when programming them as well  In that way  when I found the two custom Activities were not working properly I went back into the app  added a delay  and then moved the delay up to just after Home If you are not sure  you can download the MyHarmony desktop software at the Logitech website and program in all the various devices to see how it works before even purchasing the remote Although I gave it five stars  it is not perfect   One problem I had with the last Harmony remote model and this one as well is that it is made to fit in your hand  Unfortunately  that same ergonomic design makes it very difficult to click something as simple as Mute when the remote is sitting on the table   Allowing the application to auto program the favorite channels will work fine for most people  but if you live in a rural area and get channels from different directions  like when using an antenna rotor   you can t automatically add the channels from both directions  Pick one or the other  The solution is to add the channels you watch manually  and that can be done right on the remote  Afterwards  synch the remote on the computer and they will be saved there was well   Finally  the battery is not meant to be user replaceable  but a search on YouTube will show you that it can be done fairly easily  just in case the battery dies before the remote does If I had known these things before I bought it  would it have changed my mind  No  I have been writing reviews in the coffee industry for nearly 16 years and try to be balanced in my appraisals  This is why I added the above This model is evidently no longer for sale at Logitech  and I hope that this is not an indication that it is discontinued as that would be too bad  If you don t need the home automation and smart phone app  this remote might just be what you are looking for  We got ours as a refurb for under 120  delivered with sales tax  What a deal 
this hotspot works well for connecting to the internet away from home 
This is a nice  inexpensive upgrade for an aging MACbook  macbook pro   iMac  I ve noticed that with each successive OS upgrade for an iMac  it gets slower and slower  Turns out that 4GB of RAM is inadequate  but 8GB should do the trick 
Better in every way than the stock speakers they replaced  Nice bass response and very good highs  For the money you can t go wrong 
Keyboard is full size and easy to use  Touchpad works fine  although honestly I use the screen more than it  Fingerprint ready is very fast and incredibly accurate   I ve only had to reset my finger once in the couple weeks I ve had this keyboard 
tough getting it to work on surface pro 3  but once it worked the bugs out I love the spacing and larger touchpad
Our original keyboard was okay  but did not have a laptop feel to it  a bit floppy  The new one has a solid feel to it and the keys are more laptop like 
very paded  zipper is on inside where straps r   size of a backpack with adjustable sleeves to allow camera with long lens and other lenes on the side plus charger and cables
Sound is good  but we use them for my autistic son for music and to cancel the noise around him with out music but they shut off after so long of no use  the other feature are hard to figure out 
Bought these on the recommendation of a friend that a set of headphones would be better than earbuds while working out  I am not disappointed  Battery time is good for a couple days between charges for workouts and the sound is much better than any earbuds I have used  Not on the level of a set of Bose headphones but for the money more than good enough and how I m using them  Was concerned they would fall off during cardio and exercises while lying down but they stay in place  Would recommend these to a someone looking for a budget headphone 
Paid 49 dollars for these and they are worth every penny work well with anything bluetooth or cable
I wanted a set of headphones so i can listen to music and answer my phone without having to fumble for my phone  I tried to listen with a corded set and the cord always got ripped out of the phone while i m working  The short bluetooth connection is not a big deal because my phone is always on my hip  So far this product is worth the money 
This remote works well with our H D box  which is in another room 
Great idea to have a remote with most of your electronics connected  Only problem so far is every once in awhile what you re trying to turn on misses an electronic  for ex  to watch tv it s set up to turn on tv  receiver and sat box simultaneously  but the receiver didn t turn on  So turn everything off and repeat  Doesn t happen very often but still much better then some of the other brands I ve used 
I was just looking for something to listen to on the back porch  This fits the bill nicely  The sound quality is pretty good  especially without the extra bass  which I find to be too bass y 
These headphones are a big deal for a small price 
Nice mid price range speaker  Not disappointed at all 
Very nice radio for the price point offers some features that are not common with the lower end radios  Mounting options are standard but fits my vehicle very well
It is a very good remote to control a variety of devices in multiple rooms  It does take a while to program everything into the remote from your computer 
It is convenient to have one remote for all the audio visual equipmenton a user friendly remote  It is smaller and lighter than the first Logitec Harmony 1 that we had  I like the battery charger better too 
I was surprised at how nice this keyboard works and feels 
A ok controller  but make sure you look at the Harmony Home contoller because it does much more by radio control if your entertainment pieces are hidden 
Simple to attach  detach  nice design and the fingerprint ID provides an easy way to sign in
Nice design  It is a nice cover and you can open it or even flip it the other way for a keyboard 
I purchased the Microsoft   Surface Pro Type Cover with Fingerprint ID   Black   wished I could have purchased this in another color   other than that   it works well and very happy with my purchase 
Great feel compliments the Surface Pro I bought  Not sure I need the fingerprint reader since Windows 10 has hello  but why not Recommended 
I have tried many Universal Controllers and this one is by far the best that I have seen  It is easy to setup with the Desktop Application that is provided with the control  The control is supplied with a USB cable to connect the control to your computer  Once the control is set up  it works fairly well  If your TV has a Smart Hub  you may need toggle it back and forth a few times to get it to work  It may also get out of sync from time to time but there is a  Fix it Yourself  feature on the controller that works well  Please note that when first powering up your TV and Cable Box  you need to have the IR transmitter pointed right at the TV or it will not turn on both devices at the same time which could be quite annoying You have to remember that Universal Controllers are all Third Party so you will have to live with some imperfections in its operation  but all in all I am very happy with the control 
Needed a new computer for our church video production  Very nice price and works well
Typing on the tablet can be rather challenging but with the keyboard it makes it a lot easier  Besides  you can instantly turn the tablet into a mini laptop with this keyboard and a bluetooth mouse  The keyboard quality is very good and it prevents the screen from being scratched when closed 
Great speaker if you want the best vocals in music lacks a little bit of bass but it all depends on preference
Nice clear stereo but the microphone for use with Bluetooth isn t as clear as we were hoping for when answering calls 
For those who would rather play mp3 in a jump drive than a dvd  this stereo is great  Nice sound  good bass  I m enjoying it 
Easy install easy to use and operate remote and Bluetooth work excellent  Plan to purchase another unit for another vehicle real soon  Great value 
Let me start by saying that I now own two of these remotes and a hub  My main concern is the support  I set up my original remote without issue then I bough another remote for the bedroom and had a couple of problems getting it to work correctly  Each time I would fix my issue BEFORE I received a response from logitech support  They did not have an accurate record of my two remotes my second remote was refurbished and after support got fed up with me I was told my complementary support was over because it was a refurbished unit AND they felt like they had to tell me who the two previous owners were I don t think that information is any of my businessI thought this morning I wonder how you change the battery guess what    you cant    For such an expensive remote I really expect better support AND to be able to change the battery
I loved the remote when my uncle demonstrated his but his worked perfectly  When I tap an option or click a button  it often reacts as if I double tapped or clicked  This causes it to be impossible to completely customize my remote  I still have to use other remotes since this one doesn t work without issues 
gets lost in my black couch all the time  Should ve got the white model  They should have a remote finder option or more colors 
The quality of sound and bass are good  When you use 2 at the same time  it makes it even better 
Works well with my phone  Connects quickly  Easy to operate  I like the fact that it recognizes more than one device 
I was looking for some bass  I have a booming sub and tons of good highs  I needed some mid bass  and these were a perfect fit  They crank without disctorting  Very happy 
Love this bag  I bought an extra one for my video gear as well 
I just got this bag for my new canon 7d  It has a lot of room but the camera still feels nice and safe  I am currently using it with my 7d  135mm 2 0 L lens  70 200mm 4 0 IS L lens  and 50mm 1 8 lens  The bag is also very comfortable on my bag  The camera isn t that easy to access without putting the bag down but you can strap the bottom straps and swing it around to access the camera without putting it down 
this is a nice unit to have is a backup for when my battery goes dead  I use it when I m not able to get to a charger can usually get about two charges out of it I would recommend this as a backup  does not take too long to charge 
Set this speaker up today  and its very nice and loud  the packaging is terrible  and it was a nightmare to get out of the box  but  hey  who buys it for the packaging?Anyways  the Alexa interaction is nice  except for one major thing  you can NOT set it up to be part of a group with other Amazon  Echo devices  which was a big let down  hopefully there will be a firmware update to fix that  as I have sever other echo devices in my house  and its nice to play music and have all of them playing the music at the same time  hope they fix this one so it can be part of my  evverywhere  group 
Not too big but works great   Love fingerprint control
Internet speed good from basement  Kind of big but does the job 
Easy to set up and nice picture quality
Bought this to replace the speaker I used at work  mine was stolen from a party   This little thing sounds great and it adds a nice deep tone to most songs that need it  I like that the mega bass has a button  for songs that are already too heavy  u can turn it off 
Good to have  I did not get remote for my tv and this solved my purpose 
Went well with my Pioneer Audio Receiver  Great Buy
Works well and controls all of my devices should have purchased this sooner  Got rid of 7 remotes 
I bought both types of Sony surround speakers  I added them to soundbars  They are good but not great  For the cost you would expect more power in the sound they produce 
The finger print reader is a nice addition to this keyboard
The XPS series is well worth the extra money spent on a computer  Fast  smooth running system with plenty of RAM 
Nice system with five speakers  one powdered sub  and probably about 75 feet of speaker wire to connect them up with  It even comes with the single RCA cable to connect the sub to the LFE channel output on your avr 
Nice product works very well for me interfacing with Direct TV home network feature activated and I can watch all the DVRs in the link together  any where in the world with proper bandwidth 
Do the job  Haven t had any problems yet with the product
Good sound  Easy setup  Battery holds up  We ve enjoyed it
It gives you a complete charge then you have to charge again
It s thin and light  I can type pretty easily on it 
This controller does a really nice job at getting rid of old controllers
Easy setup and works great  Wireless is fast and have no issues with it so far 
Excellent sound clarity and great bass    Awesome 
Fyi this is a xm do if you want nfl you have to get the best of package
Fyi this is a xm do if you want nfl you have to get the best of package
Needed something in the rear of a single cab pickup truck put them behind the seat they worked out great
Once I got it programmed   works great     replaced 4 remotes
perfect for my other bedroom my uncle was so happy
Very good system only problem is it dont work right with the converter
Very nice cover completes the package of the Surace PRo
I m new to PC building and wanted the best choice for my budget and this was it  It performs excellent  Reliability is top notch  Will use this brand again when updating 
Really like the finger print scan feature and the bigger spaces between the keys 
We replaced a 10 year old harmony remote because it was worn out  The new one is good  controls all of our components  We had it installed by the geek squad  too complicated to do on our own 
I loved harmony remotes this would have been my 3rd upgrade  Didn t like the feel or the functionality stick with the Harmony One 
Purchased to replace former model of this remote  Only issue is finding the keypad  numbers  It is in a submenu  Lots of functionality and relatively easy to use and learn how to use 
What a difference  My old JVC finally died after over 20 years  The wider screen is great 
This is much improved over my previous jetpack it gives data usage  battery level  shows number of computers on and password info  Battery seems to have a longer life 
I love the new design the keys are spaced well no more mis types  The finger print recognition work OK   I use this on my surface pro 3
After multiple attempts with multiple chargers I was unable to get the battery pack to fully charge  Ended up returning to buy a different brand 
Great product  O issues  Desktop is fast for wireless  Son plays many online games and said it s better than the laptop connections could ever be 
Works as it should  Connecting with a desktop is easy going through usb 
NETGEAR   Dual Band Wireless AC USB Network Adapter   Black is easy to set up and has an amazing connection to your wireless networks
Beware that this mount will NOT fit the Sony XBR75x850c without some customization that you will have to learn on the fly  It is not in the instructions or on the Sanus website  I probably wouldn t have bought this mount for this TV if I knew of the problem ahead of time  I only came to the realizations discussed below after spending several hours trouble shooting the situation  by which time I had nicked the mount up a bit and felt I couldn t return it The problem is that the two bracket bars that you mount on the TV sit flush so you assume you do not need to use any of the provided spacers  However  once you mount the TV onto the wall unit and try and put the click cap on the lower cross bar  part number 22   you ll see that this lower cross bar goes so far that it hits raised edges on either side of the back panel of the TV  This is slight  but prevents the lower bar from fully seating into the receivers of the vertical brackets  This prevents the click cap from fitting properly and you won t be able to screw it together  The click cap is a critical component because it holds the bottom of the TV into place on the mount  which is very important when you are tilting the TV There are two possible solutions  One is to install a spacer between the bracket bar and TV when you start off  Two problems here  one is that it will now be 1  2 less flush  and the other is that there does not seem to be a medium length screw provided that will fit the small spacer yet not penetrate too far into the TV  There is a short screw  fine for when not using any spacer  and a long screw that looks too long to use with the small spacer with this Sony TV  which appears to have a shallow screw receiver  Sorry that I can t tell you if it is since I went directly to solution number two  cut a few inches off the end of each side of the lower horizontal bar to prevent it from running over into the raised area of the back of the TV  This appears fine to me because this lower bar just appears to provide stability  The top bar and wall unit hold the weight  Basically you are cutting the lower horizontal bar short of where the back of the TV sticks out again  Not elegant  I suppose  but it works and keeps it more flush to the wall  You ll see what I mean if you have to go through this exercise I m fine with other aspects of the mount  We mounted dead center on the wall so didn t have to worry about the tilt issues that other people mention  but I could see where that could be a problem since the mount has some play  You d probably have to pay a lot more for a stiffer mount     The people at Sanus were very helpful dealing with other questions I had  And I have been happy with two other mounts I bought form them for other TVs  I tried to explain all the above to them but was unsuccessful because its hard to do unless you are looking at it together 
Does not swivel            not anywhere as good as the night owl camera
Only works consistently when the tv is on  New broadcast controls on many channels generate an error that the HDMi output is not supported and to switch to composite  This would mean I have to unplug the TV connection every time I might be using sling box
Very good speakers  But they clip on my aftermarket Kenwood DVD headunit 
Nice speaker  bland when compared to the x77  x88 and x9  but does a good job overall
Resolution quality was not as good as I was expecting  screen size was to small
keypad works great  the fingerprint sensor sometimes has trouble picking up my fingerprint 
Needed to update my slingbox solo to work with Amazon Fire TV Stick  works great and easy to setup 
holds the weight  durable  but takes 3   4 hours to put together good if you have the time to assemble 
Like to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb  Good looking too
One of the best purchases we have ever made  I recommend this to everyone that has multiple remotes
love the security pad for the fingerprint safety  works well 
Works great once you learn how to use this  Also must use coputer to program
This is the best small keyboard ever  Love the keys lighting up for in the dark typing and the keys feel strong and the feel solid when you type 
The ILX is a perfect extension of the iPhone for the car  Although the list of apps that can take full advantage of CarPlay is limited  I don t expect Google Maps support any time soon   my in car infotainment experience has vastly improved 
Name Brand TV at competitive price  Though  this unit has an issue with Streaming Audio from any HDMI sources or web apps which is resolved with firmware update 1147  If you Audio drops in  out get the firmware update  Samsung will send free USB or you can download from site to a USB  This is assuming your TV isn t networked 
i will buy all my radios from best buy the service from the tecs is the best I have ever had
It is slightly expensive but you definitely get what you pay for  It is an awesome product and very functional  My TV looks awesome on my wall and it cleared up a ton of space in my room 
My son wanted a speaker to par with his phone for his 8th grade graduation  I must say the sound is great  I love the bass and the addition of the lights changing color and going off and one to the music unbelievable    BEST THING I ever purchased for him    Thanks SONY   thinking of buying one for me  
I have owned Harmony remotes since long before Logitech bought out the company I have lived with the knowledge that each remote would only last about 3 years before some form of button failure would develop  but it was worth it because no other remote on the market had the ergonomics and feature base and ease of setup of a Harmony remote My fifth and best remote was a 900 and it was a fantastic remote until the volume and channel buttons started to fail at the young age of only 2 1  2 years So I went out and bought a Harony Ultimate One at Best Buy and man oh man did I regret that  First of all has Harmony completely forgotten why remotes like the 1000 where failures and remotes like the 900 and the orginal Harmony One where great success stories Yes Harmony it was the BUTTONS and the right mixture of LCD that made the remote a must have  With the Ultimate you have too much LCD and not enough hard buttons  With LCD buttons you have to constantly look down at the remote when trying to do anything  With Physical buttons you can feel your way around the remote  Anyone who uses a remote for 2 3 weeks will become very use to finding most of the needed buttons without ever looking down once at the remote  With Touch screen buttons you can use it for years and you will still need to look down to see if your finger is over the right spot Now while I am not happy towards the lessening of physical buttons and the leaning towards touch screen  I knew what I was getting into so I was willing to live with that until hopefully Harmony realized the mistake and made a more button packed remote like the 880  900  But then acame the problems  it was like the remote had a built in Gremlin that just messed with it every so often  I dealt with lockups galore  problems with the LCD light staying on and killing the batteries and then prgogramming issues that I never had with any harmony remote before  In the end I packed up this puppy and sent her back The real shame of all of this is that Harmony put the words Ultimate on this remote when in fact they have had so many better models over the years  Lesson for Harmony is go back to basics and give the customers what they want  not what is cheapest to build  This remote finaly crossed the line and got into the realm of low quality with too much glitz and sparkle and not enough of what once made Harmony remotes great 
satisfied with remote but feel installer good have done better and helped me with adding channels an Alexa especially after paying 100 00
Got this for my parents to help them try and figure out how to watch tv or a blu ray  They has too many remote to figure it out  This helped them greatly 
This remote does exactly what I need to have done  I added the hub to be sure that I was able to get usage from multiple locations other than having to stand in front of my devices  It all work well 
I have bought this headphone at bestbuy  I alway used it few hours a day  After 4 months  it has broken  I never drop it  I don t know why ? I don t want protect it  I want to give it back and trade with something headphone else  Can i do that ?
Work only for 2 3 days and after that i am trying to connect and it is not detectable                    and facing lot of issue while connecting them
I absolutely love this bag  It has so many different compartments for different lens to fit it p  I love it 
Great features  look and sound  Fun to listen to using the multiple functions  using it for entertainment for company to experience the many reasons we love our new stereo entertainment system 
My daughter previously had the TDK   Life on Record TREK 360 speaker and when it failed her  she was hoping for a replacement of the same speaker  The sound quality of that speaker to me was second to none  at the time  but it was being discontinued  Bummed at the prospect of over paying for at least the same sound quality  we came across this product and the rest of this review speaks for itself  She thinks this product might EVEN BE BETTER than the TDK 
We purchased a pair of Beats for my daughter and she loved them  but they broke  She sent the broke pair in for a new pair  and they worked for a while  then the sound went out  So  we deciced to purchase a different brand  JBL is the working well with little to no issues 
No complaints here Pristine highs and earthy bass are reliably reproduced in these Bluetooth headphones  Daughter likes them because they are lightweight and don t hurt the insides of her ears like earbuds do 
Purchased this for my dad for Father s Day  The sound quality is good  and the speaker is easy for him to use 
I got this RAM for my 2011 MacBook Pro  It was a little slower and I got tired of waiting on things to load  Since I upgraded to this RAM my computer is running almost as well as a new computer  A small price to pay to speed up a computer like this one 
I really like this remote  I have one for each level of the house  Works well well and versatile 
I wanted something small n simple  The tv is k but the connection to internet suck  It�s either work here n there but majority of the time have no connection  Everyone else is fine even the smartphones 
Yes this is my 1st smart tv  Did not want to give up my 25  year old box tv  But that thing was getting too heavy to move  Picked this Samsung for the great picture and the price  Viewing others in the same price range this one had the best picture
The best I have bought has a good sound I listen all day and I hold the battery well
If you get the Surface  the keyboard is a must  So far I have had no issues docking and undocking  I purchased the keyboard with the fingerprint reader but haven t set that up yet  The mouse seems to work great for me and while it isn t a standard keyboard  typing on it seems reasonable  Good touch and feel to the keys 
I have 5 other over the ear headphones  These are in a class of their own  Build quality and sound is amazing  I would recommend these to any audiophile 
Granted  it is very cool to look at  But that is just the tip of the iceberg  The sound is clear and well defined all the way up to the max  You can hear absolutely everything  This is more than enough 4 a gathering of people in a large home
Fingerprint scanner is handy and the board itself protects the screen well 
This is a necessity to have with your surface pro  It s just a shame that this is not included with the pro 
Not sure why they do not package these with the surface  but a must have  The fingerprint login is VERY nice 
I like the idea of smart speakers but I have held off from getting one until this speaker was released  The problem with other smart speakers is that they just don t have as great of a sound as I would like out of a speaker  The UE megaboom with Alexa is one of the best speakers I have used so far  The sound quality is rich and loud  Even at the highest volume the sound is good amount of base and sounds crisp  The battery life  build quality  and water proof capability of this speaker sets it above other speakers  One thing I like about this speaker is that you can use it as a regular speaker if you do not want to use Alexa  The charging dock for the speaker is a must have because it allows you to set the speaker on top of it to charge and it is simple  The only downside to this speaker has to do with Alexa  When Alexa is being used on the speaker anyone can say  Alexa buy me      and it automatically purchases the item under the account owners card and mailing address  This isn t the end of the world but if anyone else has access to your speaker they can order stuff either on accident or to prank you  Overall I highly recommend this speaker and it is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers to date 
I needed a surge protector and a portable charger for travelling  This fits my need 
Really nice keyboard  well worth the money  Feels just like an laptop keyboard  and the fingerprint scanner works great  Minimal effort to setup 
Runs my home theatre flawlessly  Geek squad set up  and everything works perfectly  
Great remote  this is about my 6th generation of Logitech remotes and it is by far the best yet  Flexible programming and good back lighting  Reasons I did not give it 5 stars is the transport buttons are in a bit of an awkward place and the touch screen is twitchy when trying to input channel numbers directly  does not always pick up all presses  could just be my dry fingers after decades of working with my hands  Anyway  I cannot imagine having a home theater setup that does not include one of these remotes 
Great keyboard for the price  Fingerprint scanner works well   would recommend
I ve used this speaker maybe 5 times since purchase  2 weeks ago  and the battery life is extremely short  less than 40 minutes and more recently I charged it to 100% and the next day it shows 20%  I will be pursuing warranty replacement  Speaker is awesome outside of the battery issues  if I can get one that lasts as advertised I will be overjoyed 
A must have accessory for the surface pro computer
Big improvement easy setup and easy to use  I have many different devices and guests always had difficulty turning everything on properly  Now one touch and everything comes on automatically each time should have done it a long time ago 
The keyboard works perfectly with the surface pro and is a must have if you type often 
This keyboard and touchpad our a must have when buying a surface
Unbelievable speaker  I don t want to say for its size because it s puts out the sound of much larger speakers haven t needed to even reach the max volume level definitely recommend for home sound system 
Good price good product for the price  not much with regards to handling bass  but no complaints  Delivery turn around was better than expected  Recommend seller and product 2 thumbs up 
The light show is the best feature  Feels like I m a professional DJ  The battery life is wonderful for outside usage with no worries about a plug  I plan to get 2 more bc the syncing feature provides a surround side feel on a budget
It s a nice product for the trucker  No need to switch radio channels
It is very useful  It safe guards my devices while plugged in to wall outlet just like a surge protector  Also serves as a mobile charger  I love it and want to get s couple more 
We plugged them into the system to give a try before installing  They sound good on rock n roll classics but for movies the sound was a little too muddy for me
This unit is well priced  and can be a lifesaver  Think hard about getting this item 
This radio works must better than the previous radio that we had  Great buy 
Attaching this keyboard to a top end Surface Pro 3 really improved the typing experience and ability to add biometric security with ease of use logon improvement  Definitely worth the investment and completely consistent with the eventual availability of the top end Surface Pro 4 next year  Win Win 
Keys are wider spaced  backlighting is much better  fingerprint reader works super  keyboard is stiffer  This is a much improved product over the original surface pro 3 keyboard and worth every penny of the extra cost 
Has worked PERFECTLY since installation  Now the A6100 NETGEAR  a totally different story  But  this is about another model  and a suggested buy  NOT disappointed at all 
Very much improved form the Surface 3 keypad  Much smoother track pad and the keys are Perfect 
If you are considering the Harmony ONE  pay the extra and get the Elite  I gave my ONE to family member and got the Elite  Much happier with the Elite 
The lights on the remote makes this device worth the cost and the ability to set favorite stations is a plus along with the Philip hue light controler 
Control my own tv with my own content  It works perfectly and is so much cheaper than Sunday Ticket Max  NHL Gamecenter  and MLB TV  Highly recommended for any sports fan 
Need to learn about Windows 10  Not easy to use and need more training
I was initially skeptical due to the price and there were some shenanigans with my order  they first shipped me a refurb even though I bought a new one that was part of a lightning deal   but this thing is pretty amazing  My only issue with it is that it s not consistent when switching between modes  Sometimes I have to manually turn on  off items that are part of an activity even though it s already programmed  Other than that  it s a pretty remarkable device and the touch screen is awesome 
Originally purchased this product mainly for the color  but the quality also exceeded my expectations  Bass is pretty good and sound quality is nice and crisp  The official color says  yellow   but it s more of a neon lime green  which is exactly what I wanted 
Great sounding speakers and easy to install  Good value for tge dollar 
Screen tells status  Hold much longer battery  But heavier and thicker  Old 2012 version only holds 1 5 hrs  
I already own the Harmony Touch for almost 2 years and although the Ultimate looks identical to the old Touch  the feel of the Ultimate is much better  The Ultimate feels slightly heavier  sturdier  the back of remote is textured so holding it feels more secured  I also love that you get a slight vibrating feedback whenever you touch the screen or buttons  This is my third Harmony remote with the first being the Harmony 880  The MyHarmony software is easy too work with when configuring the remote  The  200 on sale price is a big pill to swallow for a remote but convenience is priceless 
This was an upgrade from my current Surface 2 Pro  The difference is obvious  the keys feel great and responsive  A bit expensive but the surface is not cheap either  Highly recommend it 
I went into my local Best Buy and told the representative that I wanted to buy the  Unicorn  of headphones and he referred me to the Bowers and Wilkins P7 model  The sound is great  emphatic period My experience is that they are difficult to adjust for long term comfort on my head  they require a great deal of re adjustment The other disappointment is the frailty of the cords  I had to replace the one with the built in mic after 7 months  Now the second one is beginning to fail I don t know if B W has realized this vulnerability but given the fact that they so readily offer replacements for  24 99  at last check  it seems that they may  My failed cord was very easily replaced with proof of purchase which Best Buy s retail system faithfully provided I ve got another 14 months  of free replacements then I ll have to pay out of pocket if I wish to use that cord any longer I regret buying them and would not had I had it to do again 
I love the idea of a sling box  but this is definitely not ready  Constantly buffering and freezes  Then it runs great for about 5 10 minuets  then freezes and buffers again  Very frustrating       Not worth the hassle  I would NOT recommend this product 
It s a nice solid mounting plate check and make sure its compatible for your projector
We purchased a 70 inch tv from best buy and didn t have our cable company coming in to move around the cable wires   Also with the kids gaming systems I was concerned that on a fixed tv wall mount we wouldn t be able to move the tv out from the wall when needed to plug in new things or when the cable came   So the mount holds great I thought it was going to fall off my wall   its kind of amazing the way it works and the tv is so big it makes me a little nervous  But its doing the job I had bestbuy install it and your guys are great everything is covered for one year I feel like we got our moneys worth good product and I would recommend
Motion brackets aren t really that useful with very large flat screens
mostly base  not much high freqdoesn t remain on after signal removed  Does connect easily Average performance heavy but small footprint
The only issues are the volume buttons are too small and poorly situated  Whenever I try to turn down the volume it goes all the way to mute  This is a deal breaker  The navigation system does not update when traffic condition street change  I find myself still using Google maps for my cell phone 
It took help from my daughter to hook this up to the Directv and DVD player  It would help if a User Guide with installation and operating instructions were included 
Just needed a TV to replace one that died  Wasn t planning on getting a smart TV but glad I did  Very useful  and great picture 
I was a little cautious ordering this because of I thought it might be under powered for my Yamaha amp  but I was willing to give it a shot  especially for this price  I was pleasantly surprised how great the volume was and how crisp and warm the sounds were  I tested it out with Twister  Blackhawk Down  and even less action driven movies like Stranger Than Fiction and the sounds were bold  crisp   clear  Worth every penny and then some 
The fingerprint reader works well for the times the camera does not recognize you  always connects unlike Bluetooth  magnetic catches work for quick easy secure attachment 
More RAM speeds some system processes but it doesn t speed things greatly 
i needed extened memory so i up dated my systems extened memort
I went from the simple 890L to this  The 890L didn t allow me much control but it just worked  It was very simple  This one is more complex which is nice  It allows more links  has more features  saves more devices  etc  I value most that it still has a removable battery  and can be used as an external charger Con  It hasn t seemed to learn my local towers yet so signal strength isn t caught up to what my 890L was over the last 4 years 
flashing lights and great sound all for a low price
We have a single dog who has a tendency to turn rugs into origami projects  bathe in her water bowl  and line her kibble along the floor in a row while left home alone  With the Motorola Pet Scout66 Wi Fi HD Pet Monitoring Camera  we can observe her and actually talk to her  too  Since we are not interested in remotely recording her or anything  there is no need to pay for the Hubble universe s capability Having already done the preliminary and necessary Android app download and installation  I was ready when the package arrived Setting this up took some time because I could not get it to synch with my system  After some time  I achieved success and placed the monitor in a high position to catch most of the dog s action  The camera does just what it s supposed to in a pretty good way  It s not high quality video  but I m not interested in that  just using this as a monitor  We have not used it on a daily basis  but find it helpful on days when we will be away for longer periods of time or times when the dog is exceptionally antsy I see no reason this can t be used for a child or any other person for that matter  If you re interested in recording to the Hubble universe  I think they will charge around 3 a month  I m also very cautious about having the camera display much of my home because I m a little wary of images being accessed by others despite security measures 
My alternative is Hughes Net and that s not even a consideration for me compared to adding this to my Verizon account  I am pulling down 33 Mb  s on a bad day  Add the unlimited plan and I can potentially do whatever I want with this  In the event I need to take it with me on vacation or for whatever reason  really no need with a verizon cell phone anymore  I can  Nice it has a battery but I keep it plugged in at my house  It s my new ISP at my house  plain and simple  Setup was easy enough  Need the app on a device to do it though but no big deal there  I recommend it 
so far works great when out and aboutlooking forward to using on our trip south
Thinking hard about throwing a party this weekend 
In general it works well  however the touch screen doesn t seem to be especially reliable  Sometimes it works well  and some times it takes several tries to activate the function on the screen  i also cannot get the forward  backward skip commands to work with the  hard  keys  i get fast foward  fast reverse only  Skip does work properly from the touch screen  There is a number pad available  but it isn t all that easy to get too  It s generally faster to go the nearest favorite and use the channel up  down keys if the channel you want isn t one of the 50 favorites  The non touch Harmony 650 has dedicated keys for most functions  and that makes it easier to use since you don t have to search through the touch screen menu s and it has the number pad as dedicated keys 
This is an all around great speaker  but I can t give it five stars when it doesn t stream Pandora or Spotify  Yes  it still works fine as a bluetooth speaker  but the main reason for getting the WiFi capable speaker is the ability to stream music without a phone  Sure  you need WiFi to use the Alexa integration  but to me that s secondary  Supposedly  other services will be added in the future  but at the time of this review  neither of my favorites would stream Initial setup was a little janky  I downloaded the wrong app at first since there are multiple UE apps  but after connecting via bluetooth  my iPhone prompted me to download the correct one  I could have saved that initial search and incorrect download by connecting first  I also had issues connecting over my WiFi at work  It initially connected fine  but when I went through the immediate firmware upgrade  it couldn t reconnect because it said WEP was unsupported  I did the update over my phone s hotspot  then it was able to reconnect to my work WiFi  One nice thing about the 360 degree sound output is that if you don t like looking at the giant plus and minus symbols on the front of the speaker  you can just turn those toward the wall  and it still sounds great  I personally recommend getting the charging base  otherwise the charging port is awkward to get to if you want to leave it plugged in and charging 
As I said this might be a great product    if your far more savvy than I am  I purchased this item just after purchasing a new TV  Sound Bar and Blue Ray Player  The number of new remotes that were needed to operate the devices were overwhelming  I then bought this product thinking it was the best  and may be  and I felt I could control all the devices with this one product and I suspect I could have  I feel I am pretty astute with electronics  but I couldn t make this work  If you buy this  do it when you buy your new TV and accessory equipment and have the installer set it up  It requires to be be set up on a computer  I realized that even if it worked to my satisfaction  the understanding of how the remote worked would have been over the head of my wife  who may be computer savvy doesn t really want to be any more savvy than she is right now  She never would have used the remote  I returned the product after three days 
Great product great reception easy to use rock solid product
On this product while working with a mortgage company  Product belong to the mortgage company so I need you to return it  Find it a very invaluable tool to use  Found this one online and bought it  Activated it works like a charm  Thank you very much
Love having the freedom of no internet providers  no satellite dishes  just this little jetpack connected to my cell phone company  Can take your internet anywhere 
This was a replacement for my old MIdland Weather Radio that worked for 34 years  I would highly recommend this product 
It is the perfect companion for my Microsoft surface pro 4 when I need to use it as a laptop to type a paper 
Purchased this to go with the new Microsoft   Surface Pro 4   12 3   512GB   Intel Core i7   Silver we purchased 
Am a 68 year old amateur  On my first trip to Europe  I used a shoulder bag  It held my Vixia G40  5DMk3  24 105  17 40  530EXii  a small accessories assortment but No tripod  For a man in average physical shape  that turned out to be a burden and a strain on each shoulder  So much so that I would periodically pass it to a younger person until I was well enough to resume carrying it  Carrying a shoulder bag also caused me an imbalance when walking for long distances  For this years trip  a backpack type bag was on my mind  At the store  I tried on about 8 products on the shelves before picking the last Lowepro Flipside 300  It looked the right size to qualify as a carry on bag  it could fit my gear mentioned above  a tripod could be strapped to it  it felt strong  the top side has this enormous handle to pick up the bag with  there were enough Velcro partitions for any storage configuration  the shoulder straps were wide and comfy  it holds a water bottle  it fit anywhere I went without it being in the way  and it just plain made me look good wearing it  My collapsible Sirui T 025X tripod was a little short  but extending it a bit helped getting the bags tripod holding strap around it  The whole thing was smaller if not the same size as what most other people on the flight had  The Lowepro Flipside 300 met my needs this trip  It held all my gear  I did not tire wearing it  It was easy to access its interior  I am happy I selected it  By now  I will assume that Lowepro has updated it or has designed something better in the 300 series  Lowepro thinks out well how to design their equipment  They were definitely thinking of me 
Bought this for my son  Works great  Good pic and works as expected
Memory clicked easily into place and was recognized by my system on next start up 
Adding these memory cards helped speed up the processing with my MacBook Pro 
I upgraded my 3 year old Mac Mini from 2 GB to 8 GB of RAM   works like a new machine  Well worth the investment 
easy to install and works great  was the perfect fit for my Mac
Great product  It really enhances the operation of Apple products 
Had no problems with the computer recognizing the memory 
this purchase helped to increase the memory room on my Mac  now runs quicker  and it was easy to install 
Easy install they fired right up  good starter memory 
Works as memory should and it worked with my Rizen processor 
Really disappointed after loving previous models like the Harmony One  Doesn t hold a charge very long  will stop sending out signals for no apparent reason  and the software seems more buggy than earlier versions 
They sound fine  The noise cancelling is fine  They get heavy and hurt the top of my head or ears after wearing for a couple of hours   I use these to tune out the open office environment at work   so I can t stand to wear them for a full work day 
Not very user friendly  A bit cumbersome to use  There are better Logitech remotes out there 
Love the sound and Alexus Still getting to know the system though   love that I could rely on Best Buy to find it
it works well but audio quality not really good  Convenient but audio quality not that great  but what can you expect from Bluetooth headphones 
To preface my review  I am not a technophobe and have programmed other Harmony remotes After hours of programming and re reprogramming the remote it still does not operate properly  When I think I have the problem solved the remote fails to perform a basic function like turning on or off my devices  Based on my experience this remote is not as easy as 1 2 3 4 to set up  This is a shame because the remote has some really nice features but all the great features in the world are of no value if the remote doesn t perform basic functions You might wonder why not call customer service  I did and here is my experience  The bright spot about contacting customer service was that I was able to reach someone without waiting an hour to speak with someone  Also I called at 4 30 pm a half hour before the service center closes and the customer serve rep worked with me past closing time  Bottom line was the customer service rep attempted to help me and went as far as remotely changing settings on the remote on line which only made the problem worse  At one point I had to take a quick call and explained that I would put the rep on hold and be right back  As soon as I put the call on hold the rep hung up  No call back in case it was an accidental disconnect  I called back only to find the service center was closed  I was left standing there with my remote in my hand  A remote that did not operate  I was able to re program the remote so it could operate albeit not properly I can t recommend this product and urge you not to purchase this product  Clearly the product does not work as advertised and their customer service is pathetic  I will contact customer no service this week when i have the time and update this review  But in the meantime don t waste your time or money on this remote Update  We ll it has been almost a week since I wrote my review  Just to be clear none of my components or TV are concealed and well within range  Someone from Logitech contacted me via email  no phone   Unfortunately I am extremely busy during the week and could not speak to Ian Crowe although I did call Logitech in California and left a voice mail for Ian this afternoon  I tried to work with Logitech s customer no service today  I spoke to someone off shore somewhere  No help  In fact he tried to tell me my remote was an RF remote  Just to make sure this tech rep was wrong I called Vizio to ensure the remote was an IR remote  It is  Sadly I am still where I was last week  Sending me an email offering to help me is great but I need solutions not empty offers to help  Ian please call me 2nd Update   I have been working with Logitech s Senior Manager for Customer Service in the Bay Area  for the past two Fridays  It looks like the problem has been solved  crossing my fingers   I really appreciate the time and effort that Ian has made to make things right  Logitech is sending an optional hub to try in case the current fix does not work  If I have to return the remote Ian has promised a refund even if I return the remote after 30 days  I hope I don t have to use the hub or return the remote  If I have to return the remote it is not because of Logitech s not trying  I really believe that Ian has gone above and beyond what would be expected The Bottom Line  This remote might be buggy depending on your AV equipment  But when it works  it works great  So far I really like using the remote  I especially like the favorites screen  I think my tech challenged wife will be able to use the remote too  Logitech has stepped up and helped make a bad situation a good one  I would recommend Logitech to a friend or family member  I changed the title of my review and gave the remote 3 stars from 1 star  Give this a product a shot understanding there could be a problem but Logitech will work with you to make it right  I hope the current fix works and I won t have to return the remote it really is great to use 
First let me say I bought my Harmony Ultimate One from Dell  not Amazon  I had been using a harmony remote with fewer functions and really liked it But I ve had so much trouble with this one  This remote has a feature that you press if the remote didn t carry out all the steps you asked it to perform  For instance  if you want to watch roku  the remote is supposed to turn on the television and sound bar and change the television HDMI to the one that Roku is on  I d say 6 out of 10 times  I ve had to ask Harmony to fix it  Eventually  it does fix it  but as often as not  it takes several attempts  About 50 of the time  the off button doesn t work  And finally  there s not much life to the battery     and that s been true from the get go  I really wish I hadn t bought this thing 
The picture quality is horrible  when you look at it from the side it s even worse  I feel like i m watching an old home movie without the nostalgia  The refresh rate is slow and not smooth whatsoever  pixilated picture  I was expecting so much more from a 2017 model but it s just a disappointment 
The product didn t hold the charge for as long as I would have liked  The outlets didn t work  only the USB port  Wasn t satisfied at all 
Use every day  More comfortable over time  Best sound I ve found 
Initial thoughts after many  many years of using a harmony 880 is that this remote is a great upgrade  The new software is much easier to use and customizing it properly is going smoother  I don t have a complicated setup but it works exactly the way I want it to 
I love this mount  Very sturdy using quality materials  It does exactly what it says it will do  I am using it with a 55 LG and it looks and works amazing 
Anything that I can purchase to ease the switching from TV to DVD  to smart TV  etc  is always welcome  This remote helps me figure out which button to push to accomplish whatever task I want it to do 
Would be difficult to deal with all emails and quotes when on road daily  Allows constant contact phone can t provide
Great device  Literally controls everything in my home  Well worth the money and the customization is phenomenal
program it all and use only 1 remote  Very easy set up and use 
The remote is simple to set up and easy to use but only when it wants to work  Half the time it will not power on the devices so once you turn them on individually through the remote it works fine  But its really frustrating that it only works when it wants to  Even had Geek Squad look at it and they couldn t fix it  Going to return and get a new one to see if its just an issue with this remote 
I already have one of these for myself but I just recently bought one as a gift for a friend     he absolutely loves it  Very helpful  especially when on vacation or traveling for work   One thing I noticed is that playback tends to buffer more frequently if you are connected or using it on a weaker wifi signal  especially when other people are also sharing the same signal   Overall  it s a great product and completely free to use while anywhere in the world  provided your on wifi   Works fine as well on your phone or tablet with a data plan but be aware that it will use some of your data if you do not have unlimited access  This device turned out to be a really huge hit for our family on a road trip last year because we were able to still watch some live football games and our favorite shows while traveling  Once your in a wifi zone  you can also wirelessly connect the slingbox to a larger TV screen by using a Roku stick and the slingplayer app  however  please note that the TV will need to have a USB port so that the Roku stick can be plugged into it  
Mad my CPU  Perform with more quickness especially when playing games  or for office programs 
Speakers arrived I pulled my door panels off pulled the factory speakers out the I opened the new box of alpines pulled a speaker out and found speaker severely damaged with a split cone  Poor QI from wherever amazon got speakers from 
I liked my original Surface keyboard but this one is much better  The key spacing is great and the touchpad is more responsive  The best feature is the fingerprint reader  That alone is worth the upgrade 
Trackpad is a vast improvement over surface 3 type keyboard  Keypad is also vastly improved 
Very happy at ease of set up for my 3 devices  All online step by step and plenty of help 
Music has never sounded so good  Playing FLAC files is where it s at nowadays  I do not recommend listening to music streamed from the Internet with these on  because you will pick up on all the flaws of the poorer quality audio  I threw every genre of music at these headphones  and have no complaints  ambient to pure noise metal   I am now an official fan of Bowers and Wilkins and will not have it any other way 
I d been debating whether or not to upgrade our older  well  four years old  computer that is mainly used for gaming  It s been having problems with overclocking games especially when the graphics get very animated  In the middle of a big battle  having the screen freeze or pixilate makes a person want to chuck the keyboard across the room  After looking into the cost of upgrading the memory  video card  and processor versus the cost of a new tower  it was s bit of a toss up  When this DD4 memory became available  it was enough to sway my choice and I m very glad I did  I though with a new video card and upgraded AMD processor games played much better  but with this new memory upgrade on board  WOW These sticks are very easy to install  and I like that their open design helps to dissipate heat  They took just a few minutes to physically install and then a few more while the computer recognized and adapted to the upgrade  There are zero problems now with overclocking  Everything runs beautifully and smoothly  from Fallout 4 to crazy cat videos on the interwebs  I do wish that these sticks were 2x8GB so I could do four of those for 32GB  but I really can t complain as the computer works so much better now 
Installed in a 2009 Macbook  Great increase in speed 
I was about to purchase a new Mac  but looked into upgrading the ram  It runs just like my Laptop   
Adobe CSS runs quicker now that this was installed
Surprised to see this in the store   plus it was cheap 
Upgrade was easy and computer is now much faster  Would recommend   
My Macbook Pro 2011 needed more memory to handle bigger programs  These worked perfect  They re easy to install and I think it s a good investment  My computer isn t running much faster but that s probably indicative of a different problem 
This is labeled as Mac Ram  however it is designed to work in any core 2 or 1st gen i3 i7 i7 cpu that takes ddr3 ram  It doesn t matter if is a mac or pc  It will generally also work in 2ND and 3rd Gen i3 i5 i7 also  however Best Buy stocks faster ram for these cpus 
This is my 2nd m2  unfortunately the first got blasted to the heavens by a bolt of lightning  Luckily this time around if it happens again  geek squad will replace it  The controller use is much better on bigger devices  anything 9  or higher will do the trick 
I have many hours of listening to these headphones now and completely love them  Luxury sound combined with luxury feel and fit  I wear them for hours at a time and use a high quality streaming music service  Wow  I have been listening to music for over 40 years and this is the best yet  Enjoy 
Nothing but top quality sound from these speakersEasy install
I have now had several Logitech universal remotes and I found this Harmony Ultimate to be the best Pros Touch screen feedback The physical buttons have a nice layout Many  many devices  components are supported The remote fits snuggly in the charging station The ability to add favorite stations to the touch screen has been great for how I viewprograms  If the controller doesn t have an icon for the station that was added  one canbe uploaded Easier online setup than previous remotes I have owned  The web setup makes it easier  You just need to know the proper inputs for your components Good battery life Easy to hold in one hand Convenient help feature when the selected activity does not work correctly As for Cons  nothing comes to mind 
I love these wireless headphones  They provide a consistent connection with a good range  I am using them for my HP laptop and I walk away sometimes and still I can hear the music clearly  Sound quality is that of an expansive device  I am fully satisfied with it 
Does everything it s supposed to but touch screen has an irritating delay when first using the screen
I loved everything about my flipside 300 the 1st 8 months I had it but then my zippers started going bad and getting stuck  I lost one zipper completely and the other stayed on but gets stuck halfway down  I would have given this bag a 5 star had it not been for this issue since I love everything about it  I am a concert photographer and having the bag open from the back gives me peace of mind that someone cant open it that easy 
This was a great purchase  so much more room then you would except  The padding worked amazing for traveling and its actually quite comfortable as well  No complaints 
Great value and fantastic TV  Yes it was a little more than a black friday deal but this is worth the money 
The picture is perfect  clear  and makes you feel like you are right in the picture I did see it was one of the top picks in Consurmers Report 
Very very pleased with this TV  The price point was great at  330 and the quality is as you would expect from Samsung    excellent  Picture quality  functionality  sound are great and the setup with wifi and Xbox were straightforward and quite easy  If you re looking to get a 40  and move into the 4K UHD arena you can t go wrong with this set  
Easy to set up and beautiful picture and sound love it
Nothing bad about this tv  Samsung is always my favorite  I always buy through bestbuy too 
Love the sleek style of this model easy to use fits just about anywhere in my vehicle
I actually bought this to play music in the shower  It s awesome  Super clear high quality sound  Easy to setup and use 
Me and my husband were comparing this speaker and the UE boom   megaboom  We ultimately went with this speaker and I m so glad we did  It sounds amazing  You have he option of lights on or off  in the app you can change your sound settings  more bass treble  etc  the battery life on this speaker is also just a amazing  All in all  I m so glad we got this speaker 
This speark plays well it is lound and perfect for a get together  The speaker is sensitive however and at times alexa is a little hard of hearing  When connected to the wifi the speaker sometimes just stop playing music so you have to turn it off and then on again 
Great Bluetooth speaker to have around goes from kitchen to bedroom to poolside or the garage or yard while working  Clear sound  Easy to use
This remote works all of my electronic devices with the swipe of a finger and a touch of few buttons  Convenient to have one remote instead of four 
This remote works very well  It feels good in the hand  I wish the charge would last longer but it s not terrible if I remember to put back in the charger at least every two days 
AMZING HIGH END UNIVERSAL REMOTE AND MUCH EASIER TO USE THAN MANY OTHERS  WOTH THE MONEY
Great remote for multiple settings   like the combo RF  IR ability
Just upgraded from a Harmony One to the Ultimate One  Really like the gesture features for DVR commands like skip forward  skip backward  pause and play  Took a little getting used to from switching from the One  but I definitely like it better 
This remote is so handy  And smart too  It pairs well with any tv system and is especially nice if you have more than one component hooked up to a receiver  It s very user friendly and holds a charge for a very long time 
This remote is the best one I ve ever owned  All the controls for my system are in the palm of my hand and no more having to go to reciever to change the volume and then go to DVR to change channels 
We love this product for family gatherings  We get many compliments on the colors and sound 
If you are looking for a wireless  rechargeable mouse this thing is great  I cannot comment on how well it would work for gaming purposes but I have used it for productivity and casual use and do not have a single complaint 
Works great for conference calls at work  I also love it in the kitchen to listen to my music or play YouTube videos  I have also used it in the classroom for Audio clips I want to share during my lesson 
the keyboard is easy to use  I previously had a Sony Vaio and that keyboard was NEVER my friend  I love the feel of the keys and I seem to type much more accurately with this keyboard 
This keyboard is quiet  Love the keys on it  Much better than the last version  i loved that one too  
I have both the 300 and the 500  The 500 is for taking most the gear along  but I wanted a smaller  easier to carry  on back all day  case for specialized shooting  This has worked out great  The 500 is hard to miss  where the 300 blends and when I am doing street work  I want that  Being able to quickly swing it around  open  swop lenses       Works Great  Plan to use for travel  just have not done it yet  but can see how well it will fill that role 
glad I decided to spend the extra for the computer way faster thanold one  Glad the sale person showed us what we wanted in a computer 
I love this brand and always been using it so I was pleased that it was affordable and sounds great
By far the best camera bag I ve ever owned  I love the fact it sits flat in any direction   standing  on its back or on its front  Holds my Canon 6D with 24 105mm with its hood in place plus 2 other small lenses and the charger  extra battery and more 
The Flipside 300 is great  It has plenty of room for all my lenses  small camcorder  flash  dslr with attached lense  compartment for cords and memory cards  The padding in the straps make it very comfortable and the back entry great security 
very good keyboard  can scan my finger instead of a regular log in  very smooth typing 
I replaced old pioneers with these alpines  love these speakers remind me of infinity s but have more bass  They have a pretty good range from highs to mid bass really compliment my Memphis sub s  Don t see how you could go wrong with these esp at this price point 
We ve purchased other models of Sony SRS  Bluetooth speakers before  The value and quality of the product can t be beat  The size is small and portable  yet the sound quality is impressive  The battery charge has always been sufficient for our needs The SRS XB30 adds another fun component with the lights and strobe  The light colors rotate and encircle the front perimeter of the speaker face  One simply holds down the Extra Bass button if you choose to not use the lights  but simply listen to music This speaker is easy to set up by simply connecting through Bluetooth on one s phone  I prefer the sound with Extra Bass turned on  We will definitely be using this by the pool this summer since it offers water resistance and has a speaker phone option I highly recommend this product for the sound quality  portability and value 
Great sound  My daughter loves them so much  And it is great traveling with and blocking out other noise 
i first bought the Beats Studio Wireless over the ear and they were so so  then the JBL went on sale so i returned the beats and picked up the JBLs  they blow the overpriced Beats out of the water  if i could give 6 stars i would  the noise canceling on these works wonderfully  especially on my recent flight to FL  The JBL app also lets you customize the sound  and equalizer  hands down the best headphones ive owned
I love them so much  The colors  the amazing sound    the battery life  This speaker is a must   
I had one that my family had lost  it was unbearable to try to handle the theater system without this particular remote  so I had no choice but to purchase another 
So glad to be able to buy the camcorder tapes st your store 
Love the sound missed the connectivity  I wish I could walk into the room and tell her to turn on turn off etc  so kind of bummed when it comes to the sound love it
Great build quality and great sound  Top pad is comfortable  Ear pads are a little too small to cover the ear comfortably  And the last thing is they are really tight on the head  Puts lots of pressure on the pads and ears  Can only wear for half hour at most before they hurt 
This set was a replacement from the original  I love the rich  full sound 
Bought for my husbands garage thinking it was not going to be a great sound  Boy was I wrong  Its sounds great  big sound great speakers 
I really enjoy the lights sound and portability of product 
Pretty good sound and you can link other speakers to it 
Incredible marine head unit   Brought my clarion 6 5 speakers to life  now the speakers dont distort at high volume  and bass output is vastly improved  Love the songpal app  hooked up easily to my samsung s7  Controls are super easy  and comes with a nice remote 
Have owned this bag for several years  and use it for one camera and three lenses  The flipside design is great  and has become my favorite with the open in back feature  I also own the Flipside 400 
Awfully damned expensive remote  I got this because my Mother in law is 80 and the remote that came with her new 55inch Sharp Tv was pretty chitzy and worthless  dying within 6 months and the replaced remote fell apart  Anyway  this one programmed fairly easily and the swype is so much like a phone that it s pretty intuitive  I liked it so much I kept it and will get her a cheaper one  D
i love the keyboard already  But the new fingerprint add on is definitely and interesting addition  Makes signing in to the computer much quicker and easier 
It is really nice  Much better than the close keys of the SP3 0  The finger print scanner is great  It can be flacky sometimes with the scanner or connection  But over all       Great 
The i7 in this Dell is fast  efficient and easy for my end users  Great midlevel desktop for home or office
Bought the basic type cover for my surface pro 4 because the store was out of the fingerprint reader  I realized quickly that I wouldn t be happy without and returned it trading out for this one  Very happy with that decision 
This keyboard is very easy to type on  but the fingerprint reader is the best feature  It is very accurate and simplifies login 
This TV is such a great deal for the price  I love the clear picture and the Smart TV features 
Great sound  Easy to use  Connects quickly  Satisfied with purchase 
I have always loved sling box and I would highly recommend 
For me it is a must to have to secure my online business transactions by using my own personal MIFI Jetpack 
This was a father s day gift for my husband  He loves it  battery lasts a long time and sound is amazing
I ve been looking at Slingboxes for years and finally got one  Liked it so much that I bought my Son in Law one  I viewed mine when I was in the hospital for a week by hooking a FireStick to the hospital TV  The firestick is the easiest way to control the Slingbox  although the other ways are not hard  I use my Slingbox by means of the Firestick as a second program source for a second tv in my ManCave primarily 
This is our 3rd Remote  We re really hard on our stuff  I m not faulting the remote  How many times can you drop one until it starts acting  buggy ? I ve also purchased a less expensive  but still in the Logitech family  remote for both of my daughters  I m the tech person in our house  and I ve got this down pat  My daughters boyfriend said it perfectly   At first I hated this remote  Now I love it   The programming might be a little too challenging for some  I understand  If you re giving it a shot  good for you  Just have your make and model   s ready  Also the input source   Example  Samsung Blue Ray  Model ????  connects thru HDMI  2  If all else fails  spend the   and have the geek squad install it  I say this ONLY because it has a  help  button  You WON T need the geek squad to come back and fix it for you  You point the remote AT the TV and push the  help  button  The remote will check everything connected to your T V   One step at a time  Just keep pointing the remote AT the T V  The remote will also ask questions which you answer by pushing the  yes  or  no  button  The only thing easier is to just yell at the top of your lungs  Robin  it s not working   Then I come push the button for you  And shake my head  A lot 
I love this remote  I am still trying to learn all the buttons a little different than old harmony  but better
Second remote and it s as great as the first with the hub  Cannot go wrong with this for all your entertainment needs in any room  This one is in our living room but it works just as well as the original with hub in our bedroom 
Highly recommended  Great portable blue tooth speaker  We have given this as gifts as well  Excellent value 
I bought a very cheap wall charger before and this one charges faster and easily  I m just not crazy with the short cable  but so far so good 
I needed some video tapes  I usually purchase this product
Love the sound for a small speaker and the xtra bass button 
Most of the guys on here that are whining and complaining about this remote are the old timers that spent the late 80 s through the 90 s learning macros for universal remotes  congrats  It s a dead skill  Deal with it  Speaking mainly of the guy that marched up and down the QA section telling people to stay away at all costs   It s the same as those old computer programmers in the the early  mid 90 s that kept hating on Windows because DOS was better   yeah  keep telling yourself that This thing works just fine  It s highly customizable  I was even able to put my family photo as the background and load Xbox  bluray  directv icons  etc   for my various activities  Have your manufacturer part numbers ready  go to the site or download the app  create and activity  and plug in the part numbers for each activity   good to go  They have an easy peasy setup wizard that guides you through the process  I have had ZERO issues with this remote  the ergonomics  contrary to a lot of reviews  are fantastic  It s a two position ergonomic setup  Hold low to access the d pad  volume  channel  guide  dvr  and touch screen  and hold high  palm over the touch screen  to access the actionable buttons  play  pause  rewind  etc      Underside ergonomics allow for grip with a trigger like extension and a large bulge at the backend  which is the battery housing  
Very nice  I got it for myself and really enjoying it 
The songpal app   usb slots   equals a very powerful jukebox with infinite songs that you can control from any room in the entire house 
I needed to downsize from my high wattage audio tower wiith huge speakers and was so glad to have found this system  It has Bluetooth and mps station too  I love the way it sounds 
It s so much easier to use than the other ones from Logitech  I would truly recommend these remote to anyone  You will not be disappointed at all 
Bought the keyboard as an extra and glad that I did  It s great and helps protect the Surface  Would definitely consider it a must  The fingerprint security option makes signing in easy 
A 
Easy to connect to  Excellent sound and volume  Perfect size 
Great keyboard for a tablet  slim and the touch ID is cool 
great picture  great sound  great price  purchased mainly for use with internet  could use more memory 
I didn t know how I would feel about this type of key board having spent years on a laptop  I can say it was an easy transition and I m very satisfied with making the move to the Pro4 utilizing this keyboard  Great product 
I have 4 of these outside in the patio area  Very clear and rich tone 
I just can t say how surprised i was with the feel  response of the keyboard  Way beyond my expectations  
I love my new pc  It is fast and very quietStill new to it and have not had a chance to do a lot yetBut I am very happy with it
I love the new keyboard  I especially like that it fits my Surface Pro 3  I also love the finger print scanner    
I really love my stereo I love that it connects to Bluetooth so I can play songs from my phone it is very loud so I was able to use it for a party I am very pleased
Logitech has the best quality products  I absolutely love my new mouse 
Love it works great  I have had no problems with this at all 
Small and very fast wireless mouse battery dies qu
This keyboard works great with the Surface and the fingerprint scanner is awesome   1 swipe and I m logged in 
Very user friendly and intuitive  It connects to all of my electronics  is comfortable to hold  and very easy to understand 
Wish I would have bought it sooner  I love it  It works great as the gps  The music app works well when touchingly have to tell Siri what you want to hear  Can t say enough
Would be nice if you could turn it a little louder but exceptional sound 
It holds our 65  samsung without issue ore movement  They installed it hitting all beams  my worries will be if I ever move will I be able to remove it myself  Well done Geeksquad 
I give it a 10 plus ad would recommend it to anyone who is looking for one
I love this speaker   Best thing I ve ever gotten regards to speakers   The sound is awesome   I didn t have a hard time to install it   I love how it sounds and the basss and the clarity of the speaker  Great build   Easy to charge and use   No complaints  
Had to re enter the devices and activities because my old remote was not a Harmony One  but they were easy to setup  Finished in less than 30 minutes 
As someone who is not normally a fan of on ear headphones  and these being the first pair of wireless bluetooth headphones I tried  I initially didn t have very high expectations  however the connectivity and clear sound of these headphones really did blow me away  I use them around the house to listen to audio books and podcasts so I do not disturb others and the freedom of going wireless is great 
Got this for my son to use in his dorm  He loves it  Perfect size 
It works for me and I love it  It fits all of my equipment 
Love it  I don t like that there isn t a switch to turn off light
After reading a lot of reviews both the good and bad  I went and ordered this one  I have had it about a week and this is the second Logitech remote  I honestly did not program the first Logitech remote  my husband did  he is not tech savvy at all  I have to teach him all the tricks with any device So when he say this new one  he said it s up to me  That being said  I am not an expert and have at times had to result to calling my son to get me through the tech stuff  Well I will say it was very easy to program  But  I did have a lot of my devices info prior to starting the programming  I have 8 devices  DIRECTV  Apple TV  Roku  Yamaha receiver  Samsung  iPod dock to name a few  The remote controls all the devices with no issue Now some complained about the buttons  the touch screen  swipe and even the vibration with touching  I turned off the vibration that fixed that  The touch of buttons on the touch screen might have a second or two lag in response time  but really not that bad  Compare it to what time takes to change between controllers  its less then that  The biggest thing is just getting used to having JUST ONE controller  learning to navigate between the devices with just 1 controller  Same with the gesture swipe it will take a bit getting used to just like anything else you have to learn  So far it easy for everyone in the family to use  Best thing my husband likes is the sleep mode for the touchscreen  it keeps from accidentally changing the channel or device  The only complaint would be the bump in the back for you fingers  I guess that is what it is for  it gets in the way at times  If things change about what I think I will add it  but so far I would recomend to anyone that has A lot of devices and wants just one controller
Easy setup and great picture transmission  Worth it 
Excellent device  Very comfortable  quiet and well designed keyboard 
great for any home theater  loud enough to rock the house
Happy with ease of use and compatability  Works well with tablet 
I bought this to use with my new Surface Pro 4 love it works great especially like the fingerprint reader 
I have a question for Sony it s about the subwoofer the sound that comes out of it is very low I can hear the bass but the person is singing you can barely here it  Is that what it s supposed to sound like I just bought everything else works good I love it  Just wanna know maybe I got a defective item 
I have two of these remotes  I love having all my devices controlled with on one remote 
I love Harmony remotes  I hate having to use several remotes to watch TV or a movie and this takes care of that  Easy to program 
I love satellite radio  but I wish it wasn t so much money  There are a lot of garbage on the radio anymore  I spend a lot of time driving  if I didn t have satellite radio I would go nuts    
I will be short  I love the fingerprint ID option for one key reason  It works in the dark where the ID camera does not  It works every time and it cuts time since if the camera done not work it defaults to the pin taking more time 
I m so happy with it I want to gat another one to pair it with
Love it the sound is amazing for the price  Must get another one
Love it  Does a great job protecting my expensive equipment  Extra room to store a few other things too  I feel this does a great job with lots of padding  Comfortable to wear too 
Really easy to program  Easy to use  kid friendly 
Sounds awesome  Absolutely love it  Loud and great
super easy to use of course still trying to figure out but nice radio very clear love the blue tooth
This message for Sony or any who reads it  I bought the Sony lbt gpx555 and the subwoofer is very hard to hear the music all I can only hear is some on the bass it that what the subwoofer supposed to do need to know if I have a defective unit  Because I had a sony shelf stereo with a subwoofer and it never sound like that I could hear the music 
This remote does it all  Love it  I ve only had a few months so I can t rate on the durability of it but it seems to be made well 
When I m bouncing around on a plane the finger print reader makes things even easier
Works great and easily pairs with multiple device  

Chose this remote because of Magnolia installer recommendation  Still figuring out how to do everything I want from the remote 
It works well but the button layout is very awkward 
WORKS AS EXPECTED only downfall is there are no back light for the buttons   like FF RW PLAY
A nice keyboard  The keys are backlit  The FingerID scanner is great  One touch and you are in  No typing passwords or pins 
Bought these to put in ceilings all over the house  8  and for the money you can t go wrong  Really 
This is our 5th logitec remote and 2nd Of this model  Love them  Easy to use and simple to update  Only complaint about this model is battery life  Does not last nearly as long as the others we have in the house
love the sound and all the features with this radio  my only thing is the chimes are obnoxious when I start the car now 
Sleek looking  blends with almost any style furnishings  Easy power buttons with high or low volume  Lightweight and very portable  mid price range 
Pretty loud for a speaker of it s size  Good bass  charging for phone  though I would treat this as an emergency only charger   well constructed speaker 
Everyone considering this product must want a lot of watts without the hundreds of dollars  When you first hook it up to your device and turn up the volume to see if it s really true to its claim of a whopping 2500 watts  you might get a little disappointed  Considering it is almost just half of a hundred dollars though  it is loud enough for the price 
When selecting this particular line of UE be aware you will no longer be able to pair multiple speakers through the UE app as it�s �UE Boom� series  For now the speaker is strictly WiFi as well as Bluetooth capable  Takes a little playing around with the app to pair it with your home WiFi but once paired works fine with Alexa  Extremely portable  although TSA will make you take it out of your back pack at security checkpoints  Sound quality is amazing   Battery lasts either very long  6 8hours  on low volume     or very limited  1 2hours of play  on moderately high volume  no distortion and very clear sound and the bass bumps as well  Overall it�s an awesome portable and rugged   waterproof speaker 
For such a small system this thing packs a nice punch  Nice design I m happy overall  Cons  speaker wires in box interfere with bass so it s not as clean as it could be when cranked Power cord is short Stick her anywhere and feel the bass  preferably a corner      Highly recommend 
I brought this for my teenage son  wanted to make him happy  It s loud  have to tell him often to turn it down  so I guess it s doing what it s supposed to 
I looked at a lot of options for a loud ringer and found this one  It does the job  It will keep me from missing calls  Most modern phones have soft rings that cannot be heard over TV and other background noise when the phone is in another room  Good buy 
Definitely recommend this speaker  Battery life is great and it plays my music loud like I like it   
They ain t cheap but louder than everyone else  By far the loudest speakers for their size 
I like that it has lots of room to cary most of my camera needs
Full disclosure  I m a big fan of Harmony Remotes  and other products  and I did replace this product with another Harmony remote of a different type  The big problem with the Ultimate One device is user interface  It isn t comfortable to hold in a way that you would use it  The common  static use buttons are at the very top or very bottom of the remote making their use difficult  the haptic feedback on the buttons is delayed and inconsistent and the layout of the content on the touch screens isn t intuitive  it feels like it was designed for an electronics engineer with very long  nimble fingers   not the average user  I so wanted to love this remote  but couldn t 
The fact that you can drill down to any function of a device s remote is fantastic  There are a couple of actions I wish I could program the remote to engage in which don t seem to be possible  For example  to play a movie  I generally play it through my smart TV  If you have any movies on external drives  you can t program an activity because the remote REQUIRES a second device to be the player  That s just a minor thing There are 2 significant problems that I have encountered 1  All you have to do is brush your hand lightly  accidentally  across the screen    the next thing you know  all sorts of other activities  functions are engaged and you have to reset everything back to where you were 2  The device sometimes forgets what you are doing and reactivates in the home mode  So  if I think I m going to hit pause on the movie I m watching  forget it  This happens about 25 of the time  Then I have to worm my way down through the different functions on the remote to get back to where I use the remote for watching movies One other small problem    when entering passwords and the like  the toggle switch  up  down  left  right  sometimes gets sticky and jumps over 2 5 increments on the selection It s a VERY powerful remote  I d rather have it than not have it  and I like it better than my 650  which lasted almost 10 years   I d give the 650 a higher rating  however  in its own class    because it does everything it s supposed to and does it perfectly  The Ultimate One has more functions  is more advanced and has better ergonomics  minus the hand brushing against the screen issue   but it has quirks which are definitely noticeable Read full review   
It is a replacement for the excellent Harmony One  who s 5 button gave up  While the new unit is well built  and they have reduced the number of buttons  the touch screen does not make it easier to operate  The multiple screens scroll too easily and it is easier to push an unintended command  The execution of a command occurs slower on my devices as well The unit feels good to hold  is well built and is mostly well balanced  The touchscreen retains fingerprints The unit was fairly easy to convert the commands from my old Harmony to the new one  and Harmony s on line setup is easy to use and has a large database of products My biggest problem is the 30 second fast forward command for recorded material or after rewinding a current program  It is now combined with the regular fast forward button and simply is much harder to use  Too often  because it is at the top  balance is an issue and you end up simply fast forwarding because it is difficult to push the button hard enough and maintain balance to pull off the command you want Overall  however  I am satisfied with the purchase and find it worth the price paid 
I have had sony bt speakers in the past  I laso had other brands like ue boom and bose  for me sony does right with the highs and mids and lows  bose was just mostly highs and ue boom had no good lows either  all are good  but the sony just also had more features over the other brands for less  you are paying more on bose and ue boom  neither has usb charging or 24 hr battery  and the lights on sony this year is cool
Love the mouse and that it can be wired or wireless 
added the remote to my total system and simple to use  Love it  Best ever
Had the Geek squad program our new Harmony remote  They set it up and went over all the features   Works great and we still have room to add more devices 
These headphones are good quality and comfortable  but ultimately lost the  sound off  against Beats by Dr  Dre and were returned  The sound quality is good  but they fall short in the noise cancelation department  The other thing is that they re so lightweight that they don t necessarily stay in place in intense workouts  or if they do stay in place  they feel like they could go at any minute  I would still recommend them because they are easier on the budget and a nice bang for the buck  but if you can swing it  go with Beats 
When I was a kid  I m 45 now  it seemed like we always had 3   8 remotes sitting on the coffee at any given time while growing up  Trying to figure out how to watch a movie on the VCR could be a real challenge sometimes  Then Logitech  Harmony started making these remotes that controlled everything and they have only gotten better with time  I liked this one so much that I bought two of them   one for the family room and one for my man cave in the garage  I really like how easy it is now to hook these remotes up to a computer  program them exactly the way I want with favorites and different devices etc  The first time I did it  it took about an hour  However  I created a profile on their website and the second time I did it  it was only a matter of minutes because it had saved all my information from the first time and I had more experience doing it  too One Note  Before you start  get a pad of paper and a pencil  pen and write down ALL the makes and model numbers of all the devices you want this thing to control  It will make programming it go a lot faster when you sit down in front of the computer to do it the first time    Enjoy 
Always found Samsung products to be of decent quality  user friendly  We are a little disappointed w the picture quality very snowy  not clear  on this particular tv  It s only hooked up with cable  no boxes  dvd player etc to use Hdmi  We don t want to invest in other equiptment just to hook hdmi up to  for better picture  and we certainly have no intention to rent a box from the cable company to enhance viewing  Not sure what to think 
I regret buying the most expensive keyboard for my Surface  I bought this one because it looks professional  but within a few months it started staining just from regular use I don t eat near my Surface  I wouldn t recommend this product at all and wish I bought one that does not stain 
Looking for another one  Just need to find one open box
Easy to install and sounds great in my boat  The only thing I have some difficulty with is the Bluetooth  It will connect  but it seems you have to manually do it every time  unlike my vehicle that automatically connects when I get in it  Maybe I am just missing something that allows that to happen  If anyone knows how to solve this issue please let me know 
I like having the fingerprint sensor version of the Microsoft Type Cover and use it regularly with success  I prefer it over the facial recognition of Windows Hello The material and color always seem to look dirty however  I guess the black shows all dust and dirt The keyboard is really good for people who can type though I don t like the touchpad at all  It seems small and I never feel like I can effectively scroll or accurately click something the first time I try 
Not very useful in the real world  I m online looking for a new remote because this remote is simply too complicated to use easily  The placement of the top set of hard buttons is too hard to use without activating some other function  and the sensitivity and layout of the soft buttons    touch screen is too complicated for other family members     using with Sony TV  Apple TV and Tivo 
Bought this unit at the same time as our new Samsung 8500 TV  We were interested in only having one remote for our TV  DIRECTV box  Samsung soundbar   PlayStation  I was out of town  so we had Geek Squad set everything up  then show my wife  whom was home   how it all works  Geek Squad set it up  and was explaining how everything works  He told her that this unit will not work with our PlayStation3  and we would have to buy another  box  to make it work  This is where the rub comes in  Best Buy salesmen knew  or should have known  that the popular PlayStation3 would not work with this  Universal  remote  Second  and this is far worse  the Best Buy salesman also knew that the Samsung 8500 that we were buying at the same time COMES with a universal remote  Never even mentioned that   Third  Geek Squad setup the remote  but didn t even bother to explain  nor even leave any information about how to further program the remote  for issues like  favorite channels   adding or deleting any equipment  etc I find these things very disappointing Back to the unit itself Ergonomically it s terrible  Worst I ve ever held  It is totally unbalanced  Kind of like holding a pear that s been cut in half lengthwise  The controls for pause  play etc are at the top  so you have to try and balance the awkward unit while reaching those buttons  all while trying not to let this expensive  unbalanced remotes roll out of your hand No  I certainly would not recommend this universal remote to anyone 
This will be the 2nd Harmony remote I have paid over 200 dollars for  Always struggled with the price but the 1st one lasted for years and they are so user friendly to operate  All round great product 
I had another remote same brand so i decided to try one of their high end remotes     we love it
The unit has a lot of hype  but is very hard to use  It has a lot of features but you have to touch the screen just right to make it work  or you have to start over 
Replaced a 9 series remote and I got the same functionality with less buttons   family now sold on itI have linked it to a hub as wellI was concerned looking at it that I was going to loose options but all is well in a better designed packageTo Logitech The speed of your website is slow especially start up   logging in The issue is not my internet speed  Consequently it took some time to set up
I have used older units in the past and upgraded to this unit  It is very easy to program and use  I added the hub so that all of my equipment is hidden in a cabinet and the remote works great 
I purchased this remote after my 650 died after 4 years and what a disaster After spending 2  hours seting this up ith all my devices  X1 DVR  Pioneer AVR  Sony CD changer  PS3  PS4  Amazon Fire TV and HTPC  i figured cool   it IS a little cumbersome where the button placement is for certain tasks it SEEMED to work ok until i actually started using it YES i know it does not support the PS3  PS4 or Fire TV without the additional hub BUT it doesnt seem to do much of anything right 1  i powered up the TV AVR with it but when i go to hit the DVR button it does nothing   have to go into main cable box menu then to DVR toaccess my recordings2  if i want to switch inputs to go to my HTPC  even thought i have set that up as task it does not switch inputs  i have to go to to the AVR menu then select the correct HDMI input3 if i want to switch back to my DVR i would THINK hitting WATCH TV would go back to my cable box NOPE  back to my AVR settings to select the HDMI inputi have several more complaints butian too frustrated to keep listing them herei REALLY like the 650   bought a new one before trying this remote  but unfortuntely i guess Logitech  or Microsoft  stopped supporting it under Widows 8 1 Pro because time i try to connect it to my PC using the MY Harmony software it either doesnt see the remote itself OR it freezes at 99 sync so that also doesnt work       I am hoping that logitech comes out with new design OR i may have to wait til the NEEO remote comes out to try that
     DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A MAC     silverlight and harmony plugins are CLEARLY NOT production ready  WILL NOT SYNC    tried different macs  different OS   etc i have an apple tattoo and have been using logitech for years  not anymore  and my friends at CNET will be hearing about this shortly oh  and i almost forgot to mention  the ONLY tech support option besides the user forums is a 29 an hour waste of time trying to troubleshoot the silverlight plugin 
Originally I really liked this remote  Unfortunately  even the Logitech customer service team was unable to figure out how to override the preloaded off function that turns off my tv every time I change from one activity to the next  I am forced to follow each activity by turning the tv on again and manually changing the input as well  My old harmony remote did not do this 
For experienced Harmony Users  its OK  but just barely  If you are a new user I sure it is the beez kneez compared to what ever you used before  If you are looking for a replacement for your Harmony One   though  LOOK ELSEWHERE  Logitech has completely destroyed the ONE THING that made them far and away the best remotes on the market  We are talking serious competitive advantage here folks What the heck am I rambling about  you ask Its this  the ACTIVITY BASED PARADIGM  The Ultimate still has activities  sure  but it concept has been crippled beyond recognition  Specifically  on the Harmony One  you could define  favorite channels  which would appear on the screen so you didn t have to remember the channel number for every thing   FOR EACH ACTIVITY  If you had two  Watch TV  activities  you would have two sets of favorites  Example  you might have a  Watch Cable TV  activity and a  Watch Free to Air  Activity   each with its own channel changing mechanism  Cable box or TV  and each with its own channel numbers of course The Ultimate does not allow this  there is one set of 50 favorites that you can associate with one  Watch TV  activity  If you are in some other activity and accidently press one of your favorites  it will terminate your current activity and switch to that  Watch TV  activity  This is NOT the behaviour we have come to expect from our Harmony remote where the programming hides the complexity and the buttons  all the buttons whether software or hardware  apply properly in the context of the activity we are using The disastrous effect of this designed functionality transforms the Harmony range from head and shoulders above all the rest of the  Universal Remote  into an expensive  beautiful  well made but  Ultimately  flawed run of the mill remote 
hard to program  not as many features as my old on  going to take it back when I find the receipt
Well  the YES or NO on Is it easy to program does not give full coverage to this issue  there are several questions in the programing of this remote which frankly I had to guess at as they were not clear and the help boxes available really didn t  that said with some trial and error  about three trips back and forth with the remote to the computer  I got it done do like the remote 
Easy to program and does most of functions on the direct TV remote  However  it will not do the Directv remote s 30 second advance which is very useful when watching sports programs  especially football  It does not have the back button  The touch screen number pad is more difficult to use than the Directv remote push button number pad  It does control my Onkyo receiver which I couldn t get the Directv remote to do  It controls my TV and DVD  CD player just fine 
I love this remote  Without it  I would have about 8 10 remotes  This is TRUELY a All IN ONE GREAT Remote  It even controls my lights 
This is a great remote compact and easy to use  Love having everything from TV to games to Blu Ray  etc   in one spot  I m a great fan of Logitech products and would certainly purchase this again 
This is a marvelous unit that is basically exceptionally easy to program once you grasp some of its programming peculiarities  Once programmed you need to do some work to explore its numerous and powerful functions  Logitech support staff are very knowledgeable and have vast resources to control any unusual device  I have a Visio sound deck that would not program on line that was readily programmed by Logitech support 
After owning many Harmony remotes  Logitech finally got setup and commands spot on  Especially with the nuances of Smart TV s  Sorry to see that it is being discontinued  I trust the new models will be just as easy to setup and will function as well 
I owned the Logitech Harmony one and it was very nice and easy to use The ergonomics are awful on the new Harmony your choice of functions are on the screen all the time but if your finger touches usually when setting it down
This remote makes it so simple to get right to it  even the kids can handle it  Easy to  Easy to set up 
It is a good quality product but the menu is a little bit slow and sometimes if you are to far of the receiver the command doesn t arrive to the receiver  Also the config upgrade is to slow 
Nice little Upgrade over the Harmony Touch  better grip and i like the feedback when i hit the screen  As an added bonus the iOS app actually works and is worth using as opposed to the now defunct Harmony link  If you remove the price from the equation it s an amazing product
Logitech makes the top mouses for gaming and most comfortable as well  haven t had problems with this mouse yet  girlfriend got me this and she knew I ve been wanting it  Lasts me 32 hours with LED lights OFF  Really comfortable for those who have medium to large hands 
Love the Harmony remotes and this one is newer model and will not disappoint  Highly recommend 
Bought a gaming mouse for my gaming laptop  it does Both wired  wireless with RGB lightning  Got it when it was on sale so I can t complain  i love logitech brands
Good thing this remote comes with a charger  the battery life is short and needs to be charge every couple days  Other than that  no complaints about this remote  It has no issues controlling everything in my entertainment center  except my PS3 and PS4  
I picked up a pair of the AW6500 in a last minute decision  I was at Best Buy for a different reason but decided to take a look at their outdoor speakers  I wanted to listen to them but there was only the AW5500 on display  so the associate that came to help me kicked on the AW5500  Well  IT sounded pretty good  and when I say IT  that s because only one of the speakers was working  but just buy itself it sounded really good  So the associate says that the AW6500 were on sale and I figured if just that one AW5500 sounded good two of the 6500 should be even better  Got them home  hooked them up and hung them on a cross beam in my carport about 2 feet from my house with the bass towards the outside stucco wall so the bass could bounce off of it  I hooked them up to a older Sansui AU317 amp  that has a 50 watt output and then tied my IPod to it  put on some live blues tunes and cranked it up  WHAT A PERFECT MATCH     The sound comes thru crystal clear  excellent highs and the bass is unbelievable for the size of the cabinets  The placement of the speakers really make a big difference too  because of the wood structure of the carport tied into the house  the bass really radiates thru out the carport  especially when I stand in the sweet spot where both speakers can be heard  One of the better choices I ve made in a while 
I don t suppose Best Buy employees are knowledgeable about every product  but I received no warning about compatibility issues  I have DirecTV  and getting SlingBox M2 up and running has been a huge headache  No luck yet  despite conversations with both SlingBox and DirecTV  Some kind of disclaimer from Best Buy would have been nice 
Good choice for more sound from phone charges fast   will last a while on charge   Sound of a more expensive speaker   for a good price  
I could not program the PS4 to it  Otherwise  my tv  my receiver and verizon are all programmed to it  It is not easy to use 
Love the sound quality  For the price you can not go wrong with Sony 
Miss my now broken harmony one  Not a huge fan of the LCD  Kinda sensitive and it also doesn t have the signal strength as the old one  Has to be pointed directly at my receiver to change channels  Bring back the old harmony remote 
If you re considering for a rear deck install or any other location with huge airspace  keep looking  These fall on their face in infinite baffle locations  Possibly good for doors  but I have not tried them as door speakers as I m very happy with my Orion cobalt CO650 speakers in my doors  I give 5 stars because i don t want to alter the products overall rating at the time of this review  4 5 avg of 3 reviews   but I want to steer away anyone considering these for the rear deck of their car 
I anticipated limitations with this item  I was right on  gave it a shot 
radio is not bluetooth which is not a good thing if you want your kids iphone s to be connected to 
GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE  SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT 
So far so good  Looks good  good speed  Haven t put it through it s paces yet but I m loving it so far  
Nice balance of sound and like the extended response  Beautiful construction with metal parts  Clamping is too strong and can be uncomfortable after 2 hours of listening  Keeping them anyway because I like the sound  I listen to rock  metal  jazz and classical 
Like the older model better  this model I have to have the doors opened  Screen is very sensitive  wish there was a better alternative 
Probably wouldn t get the thumbprint one again  Don t really need it 
I like the fact that the backpack is spacious but it not too user friendly 
I like it  but sometimes I accidently touch the screen and something happens that I don t want  Kind of miss the buttons on my old Harmony  but I appreciate all the features on this one 
not much volume when linked up to my ipod thru bluetooth    i prefer my beats
The TV stand shown on amazon web page is not the stand you will receive Based on Samsung s web site  the new version of this TV has two small plastic stands at left and right extreems of the TV We needed to have the following 4 features on a new TV 1  HD 2  32 inches 3  A one piece stand at the bottom center of thel TV 4  Two HDMI ports So  when we received it  and saw the cheapo footies  we talked about returning it to amazon  At the same we checked Samsung s web site and found that the New version of this model has the 2 footsies  Like most manufacturers  always looking for ways to make a product cheaper  After debating on whether to keep or return the TV  we decided to keep it  We settled for three out of four features we wanted Not happy  but could not find another brand with the features we needed 
Like it so far  This is a replacement for my old Logitech 1100 that I had for years  Still getting use to it  but does everything that I need it to do 
I like it alot  Sounds good  Would purchase again 
This remote replaced my older Harmony One which was not working properly anymore  This one is smaller and a couple of features require an extra step to work  eject for DVD   There is a slight learning curve but even for my aging mind I have been able to use it well 
I couldn t wait to open the box  The instructions are easy to follow and the installation took me about an hour by myself  Not bad but I would recommend having somebody else to help install  Holding up a 50 lb mount with one hand and drilling the bolts into the wall by yourself is not an easy task 
Wanted the ability to utilize 4G network with my phone and work iPad  Was imtimadated at first  however when I finally used it  it was easy  Just not to crazy about the on  off button 
The case is very lightweight bit does more than gets the job done  It has good shock absorption and protects well against scratches  It is also easy to take on and off which is a plus for someone like me who takes it to the gym in a armband case
This thing is amazing  I m an online college student with a VERY busy schedule  so being able to get internet anywhere is really important  Also  using this instead of the mobile hotspot feature on my phone saves my phone wear   tear and over heating  Considering the phone is  700 new  this is worth it  
one remote to do everything  easy set up and if you put it on the charger  stand no lost remote
This is amazing  Easy setup like if they knew my devices  I m controlling 6 devices flawlessly  Highly recommend this remote 
Works great with all my products Little bit of a lag  but not an issue for me 
This device is allowing me to cut cable from our vacation home  I can now pay ONLY for internet service and watch my cable box from my primary residence when I m at our 2nd place and don t have to pay monthly bills when i only use it a few days a month in the off season There are some bugs  occasional buffering and cumbersome remote interface from the phone but saving  85  month eases any frustration 
This product does it all  I only need the one remote no more clutter on my tv stand  Luv this product 
Charges well  efficient  and keeps me going at work  highly recommend 
Performs very well  has great battery life and outstanding bass  Only thing I would change about the speaker is being able to use the usb to play music
Love this stereo  Awesome sound  good quality  decent bass  The only thing I would like more from this stereo is more bass 
i like it a lot it s a good product but way to expensive that s a shame
My problem was that the laptop was no longer charging  Purchased this Lenovo adapter and it worked at first  Now  nine months later  it is doing the same thing it did before 
Reviewed these initially under a different name  They broke after four months of use  Normal use never dropped them  The inside of the headband where it attaches to the left earcup broke  Then there was something rattling inside  Took them back  Got a new pair which had a really loud static sound that came out of the left earcup  Took it back and got some Bose Quiet comfort 25  They re not wireless  my fault  Took them back and asked BB if I could get something else and they said sure  Got some Senn M2 Wireless  BB was great throughout 
Bought the Harmony remote to consolidate the 6 remotes I was using and make it easier for the wife and grandkids to get everything turned on and set correctly  Process to set up the remote is very straight forward and easy  After about a half hour  I had all my devices programed and several activities set up  Now with just a click everything turns on and set to the right inputs  outputs 
This is not the great work of Sony  my old system the Sony Muteki LBT zx99i is far superior  that system has 4 speakers  A and B  The lesser pair being B is deafening  all four is maddening  This stereo isn t worth it 
Sound quality is ok at best  Manual is horrible  But that s typical for Sony
In my house with electronics everywhere this is in my hand constantly   I am thinking of making a little holster for it  
I have a Surface Pro 3  which I love   When the Surface Pro 4 was released  and the type cover 4 I bought one  And there is a big difference between the type cover 3 too 4  Two days a go I bought this signature type cover  and I do not feel any difference when I am typing  And I use my Surface every day  so I type a lot  and I will be open  For the price it should ve of been way better  It is not worth the price  The only difference is the color and the material but it feels the same for me  I am going to return the Signature Type cover and keep my Type Cover 4 
I bought this item thinking that it made sense to be able to sling it over the shoulder  Turned out to be very inconvenient  Replaced it with a conventional Domke bag 
Not just big bass but great sound and an impressive presence  Battery really does last 20  hours  It s taken a few splashes and still jams 
This little speaker packs tons of bang for the buck  Great clear sound  nice bass  and phenomenal battery life 
These are exceptional bluetooth headphones  They sound superb  Great and even sound thru out the entire spectrum  They paired up to my iPhone 5 no problem and always connect with ease  They look and feel fantastic and they are well made  No need to spend a fortune on headphones  These are the ones
My two sons love this so much  My oldest bought this with his birthday money  11 yrs old  and now he wears them all day everyday which leaves his hands free and no iPod or tablet tied to earbuds causing accidents while he does his chores around the house  He started using google voice from his tablet and can talk on the  virtual  phone with these headphones  It s pretty amazing  My 2nd son  decided that these we so cool that he also used his birthday money to buy himself a set in blue  It s just a matter of time before all three have a pair 
My computer needed a kick and the ram did the trick 
keyboard works fine fingerprint recognition works well 
Took a little getting used to the cramped keyboard  but I love the log in options 
I really like the fingerprint ID makes logging in very easy and fast  The key on the keyboard are very smooth 
Admittedly I haven t tried very hard to fix the problem but I only get the touch pad to work every 5th try or so  Makes it almost as slow as typing a password  I do want to reiterate that I have not yet tried to research the issue though 
Keyboard was great and love the finger print scanner  
Fingerprint scanner is a cute addition I never use  but someone might enjoy it  The rest of it works as nice as the old keyboard  I press down on a key and the key magically transmits to the screen using the power of positive thinking and Bill Gate s manly aura 
The key board is just like you would have with a laptop  It poses nicely as a top cover for the surface
Our old one worked for many many years but finally gave out  This makes a great replacement 
This charger is great for keeping my devices charged  My cell phone sometimes does not stay charged so this device keeps my phone operating until I can charge it at the end of the day  Great little device to have 
We replaced an older Sony marine radio  from 1999 and still working perfectly   We wanted  needed Bluetooth capability  It Was easier than we thought to install  Sound is great and almost too many options for our simple needs  The ability to pair more than one blue tooth device is bonus 
First  I have a commercial radio license and before I retired I was the Data Specialist for ATT  I previously had an 880 but after eight years it just wore out  As to the plus side of this remote  it is extremely versatile  You can leave the other remotes that came with your equipment in the drawer  Now the significant downside  You need to have an eyeball in you index finger  Replacing buttons with a press on the small screen is ludicrous and frustrating  Downer 2  the thing locks up for no reason what so ever  You have to cover the IR port and press the off button and then with the IR port still covered  you press the menu button then select on the screen what you were previously doing  If you want assistance  good luck on that  I hope you understand Philippine English better than I do  Frankly it s a huge loser  I ve had it for three months and I m going to put it on eBay and sell the useless thing 
Good Price  good TV happy with the purchase  easy to purchase  set up and enjoy
Saw this in a store and could not believe the price  but we needed something to swivel sideways  This more than meets our needs  It was relatively easy to install  and is very sturdy  So glad I checked this on Amazon  Still expensive  but about 100 less than box store prices 
A friend told me about this little device for watching YV while away from my house  I had heard of it but really didn t know what it was  Well  I wish he had told me about it earlier  It does everything as advertised and is a breeze to set up and use  In reading some of the reviews  prior to purchase  it wasn t clear to me if the Slingbox would connect wirelessly to my home network or if I had to hardwire it to my router  Some claimed yes  some said it wasn t  Well  I m here to say it is wireless  Connected to my home network in no time  Just follow the instructions that come with it and you will have no trouble 
Haven t used a CDROM in a long time? This is the unit for you  Super easy installation and great features  Connects to both my iPhone and Android easily  Will be getting another for my 64 VW Bug 
I m a landscape photographer and recreational hiker and was looking for something that would carry my gear comfortably and conveniently and this fits the bill perfectly  It easily carries my 5D  filters  accessories  and more then I need in the field  but it s all there  The flip around access to the storage area is nice  but I did have some trouble with the straps coming undone  This was easily fixed once I made final adjustments and secured the straps better The extra padding on the lower back is nice and the tripod holder is convenient too  This was the right size for my needs and with several months of use and many miles of hiking the woods  I m very happy with the purchase 
Just what I was looking for  I have U Verse service  Their app is really good if you are located in the US but when you travel abroad you can t use the app due to copyright issues  With Slingbox you fix that issue as long as you have an Internet connection  Easy to set it up and works perfect 
The sounds is awesome  Perfect were I use it  Love the color 
Fast   easy set up  connected to internet immediately no fuss  Speakers appear to be adequate for small room 
I WAITED A LONG TIME BEFORE BUYING A SERIUS SYSTEM  A DAY AFTER I BOUGHT IT I LEARNED THAT IT WAS ON SALE NOW CAN I GET THE SALE PRICE DIFFERENCE REFUNDED TO MY CREDIT CARD?
My MacBook pro was a little tired  doubled the ram   it woke back up 
Couldn t be happier  Going from 7 remotes  now  just 1  Should have made this investment long ago    
This product is great I no longer have to use 4 different remotes to watch tv play games listen to music watch movies  I will eventually get one for all my tvs 
Just what I needed as a companion to my Surface tablet while traveling  We still have dumb phones so this allows us to use the Surface on the go  We have had the unit for a year now without any issues  I feel more secure using it rather than loging in to public hotspots 
I purchased this JVC head unit for sale and got it installed in my vehicle  Not too shabby  Very convenient that it has Bluetooth and you are able to connect your phone to it  I can make or take calls and use my car s speakers to hear the caller  I believe I like that feature the most  It s a nice receiver that has more options that I m too lazy to list  but at the price of it  it s a best buy 
Just the remote I was searching for  Well worth it if you have multiple devices  Only complaint is there was no custom wife mute button 
this machine is the same size as a previous machine but is more expandable which I like  good looking machine 
I really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but I ultimately had to return them  Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new  genuine leather  From the thick headband to the ear cups  this baby is soft  premium leather all the way  The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they re not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them  Here s my first comparison to it s peers  Most every other set  even over  300 is almost completely plastic  This is solid metal and leather through and through and it s heavier than its competitors for it  That s already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag  It s obviously a higher quality product with better materials  I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached  Should there be an unrepairable break or tear  just buy a new set and pop them on  Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches  This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in  You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design  The picture doesn t do these justice  They impress from top to bottom  One thing they don t look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms  sweltering heat and storm season outdoors  They re also softer than they look  The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they re very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded  I also like the added thickness on top  They did feel good at first when I put them on  but I felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them  The clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw  under my ear ache  They seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise  They re easily the best noise isolating headphones I ve ever put on  They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case  making them more portable  The ear cups don t swivel though I ll be honest here about the sound  I have to say  I came away disappointed  They don t sound bad by any means but they re warmer in the mid range that I like which sacrifices some of the treble that I m used to  I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X s  they didn t blow them away  which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation  I then realized that it wasn t a realistic expectation because my M50X s are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage  I thought the P7 s would outperform them so well that I d just ditch them completely  That didn t happen  In fact  I m now convinced that it s probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these  If you have a good set already that s at least over  100 to  200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser  V Moda  Beyerdynamic  Bose  Audio Technica  Sony  etc   intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats   the P7 s won t completely redefine good sound for you  At least they didn t for me  Once I got over that  I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have  My M50X s are just a notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them  These are a different flavor altogether  The mids and lows are much more pronounced  pushing vocals to the forefront  Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music  Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention  Cello s  harp s and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me  Bass kicked electronic music  Daft Punk  Deadmau5  up a few notches over my AT s as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious  I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I m not a bass head so I don t want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either  It sounds like it s getting close to the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there  I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT s can do very well  Most of the bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7 s which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches  I prefer a V shaped sound  favoring the treble and bass  In fact  I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ s  so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums  I also couldn t distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars  On a particularly heavy song  the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my M50X s to remember how much I should be hearing it  The extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation  The P7 s made most everything sound better and outperformed my M50X s just not it the rock category which is a big one for me  They came up short according to my tastes  Headphones originally priced at  400 shouldn t have such a glaring weakness  They should do everything really well but don t  That was the main reason why I had to let them go Outside of music  the P7 s also worked well with T V  shows and movies  Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience  The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable  My M50X s held their own while doing a direct comparison though There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad  The cord even feels better in comparison to others I ve felt  A drawback is the included case  While it s nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones  I m not a fan of soft cases  Especially not for expensive electronics  It ll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you re going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently  I d have my reservations  These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls  drops  getting sat on or being crushed by other bags  The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife s make up bags which is a bit of a turn off  That s a very minor gripe though In conclusion  these are premium  luxury headphones  The look like it  feel like it  smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me  If you ve already invested in a decent set of headphones  they won t completely redefine portable listening for you but they ll provide you with a quality product that s physically head and shoulders above everything else I ve seen on the store shelves I still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds  For heavy vocals  stringed instruments  and almost everything else  they re still very good  Hard rock is their achilles heel though  I m just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion  I now have a greater appreciation for my M50X s though  Going head to head against a high end headphone like the P7 and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision  that was the main reason why I couldn t keep them  I just couldn t justify paying  300 for a set of headphones that didn t completely outperform my M50x s  are actually lacking the treble that I like and hurt from the extra clamping force  But they sure are nice looking 
After looking for a set of speakers that would not blow the budget  but also not sacrifice the quality of sound  we chose these D A  outdoor speakers  The installation was easy  We have ~550sqft patio and there is plenty of sound  including bass to be felt  It is hooked up to volume control switch just inside the door running off a Denon DRA 397 which handles five sets of speakers in the house 
I bought this for travel  to carry my Canon  DX MkII  100 400L  100 2 8L Macro  24 72 2 8L  17 40 4 0L and 600 EX RT flash  I can even strap my tripod to the back of it 
Typing is much simpler with the pro 4 keyboard and the fingerprint sensor enhancement makes securely logging in better 
Love that it s water proof charges very fast   long lasting charge
Could be made easier to setup Base is just okay Good sound but still a little disappointing for the money 
had to return because of one defective stick  good looking memory though 
It s a great device if you have multiple devices  however  I don t like that you have to switch devices to turn the volume up or down for the television 
Doesn t work well with chromecast  Does ok with roku  I have a lot of pauses   buffering but that s probably due to slow internet speed 
It s just awesome  i have the other model in my bedroom  the one that comes with the hub and i dont like that one cause it has a terrible delay when trying to type numbers or changing channels on directv   it s a pain and frustrating most of the time  this one is old fashioned IR and everything just works fine  for that people complaining about the touchscreen and the layout of the buttons  stop complaining and get used to it  just like you had to get used to 5 or 6 separate remotes before   this thing is a beauty   
What a difference the keyboard makes and the fingerprint scanner works great 
Great product  Very easy to setup and works perfectly all the time
The coolest devices imaginable  Everyone should get one 
Just as the reviews said great sounds solid construction love them 
The tape deck is great so far  2 1  2 weeks   The blue tooth works great and is hands free  I had trouble with the clock showing up on the display but its been up the last few days with no time lost  The only minor down side is at night even though it does dim automatically its still kind of bright to me  but then I set my instrument cluster lights very low  All the other functions work as advertised 
This is very easy to setup and very easy to use  If you have a smart phone then this harmony you will find very easy to use i even have my wife using it and she is a technophobe      
I purchased these speakers hoping to get good  clean sound outside  They are rated for 200 watts each and sounded pretty good in the store  Unfortunately  one of the two failed completely during an outdoor party I had shortly after installing them  My receiver is only rated at 100 watts per channel so I m sure the failure wasn t due to overloading  The store readily replaced it  after the party  but the weather has turned since then and I haven t had much occasion to use them  They sounded pretty good for the first hour though  First speaker I ve ever had fail 
After 6 months the remote won t update rendering it useless  The website is garbage and the remote is garbage
Would not come on unless plugged in  Battery would never charge up  Connecting to phone was nearly impossible  was only successful at doing it only a couple times  Threw it in trash 
Went with this vs Bose because of price  Quality is good 
This is my 2nd Jetpack Mobile Hotspot and was purchased to replace my last one  I only use it occasionally for a few areas where I have no wifi when I am using my wifi only iPad  I have had no problems with it  I have used in when travelling in the car  It is perfect for what I need and fits perfectly in my purse  If not in a case  the power will come on occasionally in my bag 
Verizon s 4G Mi Fi was easy to install and get online  If you have the need for a mobile internet or just an alternative to the high priced internet for your home  this is the way to go 
This headphones plays music clearly  eliminates noise from outside 
These headphones have been super  I love the noise cancelling as I can wear them while I am on the lawn mower and they sound great 
JBL always puts out that clear crisp sound every time  They can be loud or normal sound and have the same quality either way  Most speakers lose that quality the louder you go  Love all things JBL  Keep it up 
The JBL Everest Elite 700 rocks  I have loved being able to enjoy a high quality listening experience and tune the world out when needed or desired 
I purchased these after a sad loss of my Executive Beats by Dre  I was in the market for something better in every way  I do believe the Everest has done that  The wireless part is awesome I appreciate the freedom of movement  Also the noise cancelling is on another level  I frequently travel and study in public places so I needed good active noise cancelling 
Works as advertised  Happy with the free App and ease of use  Ear cups are a little small  but wiggling assures a good fit every time Sound is great  I m happy with eq functions on the App and wireless works great for listening and cell phone calls Case and accessories work and fit well 
For the price I paid for this wireless Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones the sound is great sounding compfortiable headphone I ve ever used the my jbl headphones app is a great feature I would tell people to buy this I am a DJ and is as clean sounding as my pro headphones so if your searching for a really over the ear Bluetooth head set you should pick these up while you can 
I love the very smooth sound and cancellation technology works great  It feels like I m in a studio 
These remotes are just not reliable  I ve had 4 over the past 4 years and all but my newest one have gone bad within a couple years  These are too expensive to be replacing so often and they only come with a one year warranty  They also only come with a limited amount of free phone service support from logitech which seems like an aniquated business model to me  My latest remote is under two years and just broke last night as I was updating a component  Even the complete factory reset doesn t unlock the frozen remote  
This headphone doesn t state noise canceling  but the surrounding noise is really dampened when I put these on even before any other audio is streaming  I haven t used the built in microphone thus far but I do like listening to my videos and music with the cushioned ear pads instead of the in ear buds 
I got these for my son and he uses them every day  He likes being able to walk around and not be tied down by wires 
I it s very good ram and work very well thank you and the service is very good too
What I like most about this charger is the stow away USB and how thin and easy it is to carry around while using my Galaxy Note 3  Plug in the USB and back the charger flush with phone to make this convenient plus easy to hold onto  even with such a huge device as the GN3   I admire its look as a matching accessory for the GN3 but  60 for 3100mAH seems pricey  I ve spotted this same unit selling for more than  20 less on the internet though it seems doubtful you d have the same support from third parties as with Best Buy   This charger is  was offered in two colors  black or white  with the same finish and faux stitching as the GN3  if you prefer that look  and comes with a small  easy to store charging cable for the device  This charger has a percentage level indicator that s not precise  though still useful   simply locate the  button  on that side of charger and press it in  These are the levels per lights  Blue light   100 80% battery life  Green light   80 20% battery life  Red light   20 5% battery life  Red blinking light   5 0% battery life 
I have a Samsung note  Mophie does not make battery packs for this so I had to try this battery pack  It was small  compact  easily charged and attractive 
Im enjoying my speaker for sure Great sound and the extra bass it has  really makes a difference from the other speakers  Makes more noise then what it looks it  
Not really much to say here  It s DDR4 RAM so it s super fast and what you ll need in the most current builds Just as an FYI to anyone shopping who isn t aware   DDR4 RAM and DDR3 RAM are not compatible in each other s slots  Be sure you know what you re getting  otherwise you ll end up with a useless  for you  part that you will need to return for something else 
It works what more do you want? It looks pretty cool too
I ve had the Logitech G wireless gaming mouse about 2 months now and I love it  This is an excellent wireless mouse  It fits my hand  which is pretty average sized  perfectly and so far it s been flawless in response times  One charge lasts me around 3 5 days and recharging is super easy  LED lights have total customization with the Logitech G gaming software which is pretty amazing in itself  Can t say enough good things other than it s perfect for me  I highly recommend this if your looking for a high quality wireless mouse 
I purchased this to extend surround sound  but it seems that you can only use wireless surround or wired  not both together  It also forgets if you have something connected to aux  so you have to continually change the input back 
I bought this as a replacement for an older Logitech Harmony One  It s a step backwards in many respects compared to the Harmony One  It doesn t have a physical keypad which makes using it as a replacement for your cable  DVR remote awkward if you just want to punch in channels  There is a touch keypad screen available  but it is really awkward to use compared to a physical keypad  From an ergonomic perspective this is about as bad as it can get  It is awkwardly balanced and very thin at the end of the device  The FWD and REV buttons are located on the end of the remote and are really not positioned in a logical place  The battery life isn t nearly as good as the Harmony One either as it needs a recharge within about 3 4 days even if it hasn t been used very often within that time frame  The ability to use gestures on the touch screen seems like a unique idea  but in practice it doesn t work smoothly  Overall it s an OK device and fairly well built  but for the money there are a lot of shortcomings 
I had high hopes for this  The Phone app is ok   but you have to  cast  from your iPhone to Roku  I was hoping there would be a Roku app for this 
It ok  It s very important for my school work and my family
I like the fingerprint access option  It works well 
It s ok  not as loud as I thought it was gonna be  but good enough for the classes we put on 
Its ok at best  the touch screen does not work as well as the button type and we cant scroll through the guide as easily as the old one but other than that its ok
Not sure if the extra money is worth the fingerprint
Both sticks worked and fit in my iMac without issue 
Nothing special about these speakers other than the brand It sounded like my set of stock pioneer on a 03 civic SI 
It is perfect and smooth to use it with my computer 
It s good  not too hard to set up  needs direct line of sight  but that works for our arrangement of stuff  needs to learn  and it seems to to that okay
It s a great addition to my music collection  long lasting battery 
It s everything it claims it is  Just gather all your TV  Soundbar and all other device model numbers ahead of time  It ll make setup a breeze 
We bought three of these for use with our surface pro 4 tablets  Outstanding quality and ruggedness  The size is comfortable  the keys have great tactile feel and the TouchPad is amazing  We don t use the fingerprint reader since Windows 10 uses the facial recognition  We have owned and used them for quite a while now and they are working as good as new  We plan to buy more 
Highly recommended  The bass is amazing my daughter loves it
big things come in small packages  good soundExcellent 
This travel charger has a cheap build quality but considering the price it isn t a big deal  Also the plugins on it DO NOT CHARGE unless the charger is plugged in    So really the only thing that this charges is the 1 usb port  Plus I only get half to a full iPhone charge on a full charge of the Belkin Travel Charger 
Sony hasn t let me down yet  Do your research first
It s a pain to get on the wall and the directions really don t help  However  once it is up there it works as stated 
Great remote for the price plus it was very easy too set up  No fuss
I haven t encountered much wrong with it  but occasionally the touch pad is a little too sensitive 
The watch works great  pairs easily and seems to be very scratch resistant  My biggest peeve about this purchase is that the sales rep talked me into a Bluetooth model  I asked about the discard models and was told they were  twice the price   which I later found to be very untrue 
Bought as a gift on 9  10  17  Delivered on 9  13  17  Top of frame started separating from the screen on 9  21  17  Bummer  Should be better quality sold 
It is a cool bag  It has compartments for lenses and othrt accessories 
These speakers have a very big housing that will require me to cut a large piece from the panel  I exchanged for a pair if Kickers 
UE took away features for a louder speaker and added Alexa  If you have music playing you�ll have to yell at the speaker for it to hear you  Battery life is average
I can use my iPhone to do the same thing  However if you need a hotspot other than your phone this one work well  The only issue is the interface hard to use and no way of getting home 
works much better than the cheap ones i ve had in the past
Easy to install  Can t beat the price compared to the Mac store 
I was skeptical of the fingerprint sensor because of issues with my Apple products and an old HP laptop with fingerprint sensor  This Surface Pro Type Cover s fingerprint sensor works great  Glad I stepped up to this keyboard 
Excellent  I highly recommend it  The salesman was very good 
Works well and love how easily it is to use  Love it 
This remote replaces all of my others  Once it is programed it works perfect 
Don t buy this piece of sh*t  It works great for about a year and then the display fails  They obviously put a bomb in the thing to make it fail so you need to buy a new one  Should cost about 15 bucks if you want to make a disposable remote 
Works as expected  No issues  Fast  I added a 250 gb ssd and it is quick  The RX 560 is good enough for high settings gaming  i7 is over kill for what I do  but it was on sale  i5 computers are plenty fast unless you do a lot of video editing and rendering  Case will hold 3 hard drives  there are a total of 4 sata ports inside  1 for cd drive  3 for hard drives  Case has standard size power supply so replacement should be easy if u want to upgrade to high end video card  If i replace power supply  get one with short cables  case is compact and no need for long cables  The usb c plug is in back  I wish it was in front  no big deal  I can run an extension hub if i need to in the future  There is 2 free memory slots if u want to add more memory  Again  that would only be necessary for intense memory programs  Computer is quiet  I am happy  Regular price of 1049 00 is too much in my opinion  but I bought it for 775 00 on sale open box  So if you can  wait for a sale  Oh  there is a M 2 slot  have not installed anything in it  but its there 
The fingerprint reader works great  the keyboard itself is nothing special  It works as intended too 
Love this device  Good standby time  It allows me to connect my iPad and laptop without problems 
works almost every thing in my house               
It does what it needs to do  as advertised  I haven t used it enough to gauge whether it deserves that fifth star  but a  it does have a lag and b  my wife was having problems losing signal and having to restart 
It has volume control  4 ring tones and each ringtone has variable tonal settings to get the optimum settings for the hearing impaired  It also has an off switch and the settings  manual  remain when it is turned back on 
needed a new charger and cord  no complalints     
the good   didnt have to put in much effort to install it  work good with no disconnections so far  comes with a base  so you dont need to put it directly on your computerthe bad   it 3x the size of my old belkin adapter  someone smart thought it was a good idea to put a magnet on the base of this thing but as long as you keep it away from your computer it should be find
For such an expensive device  the software is pure stupidity  It waste time at start up updating my device when there is nothing to update  I mean  wait until I change something  then update That said  I have to fall back on my device remotes everyday because this device is little more that an on switch I wish I had saved my money 
Works good and I have no complaintsIt was a gift for my grandson  he likes it
It was ok didn t like it as much as I thought I would
Not much to say about RAM  Either it works or doesn t 
Harmony products are excellent  So was this remote  It performed exactly as I wanted  It took me about 20 minutes to set it up and I was off and running  I highly recommend this remote or any from Harmony s product line  I will say this  It is not a beginners remote you do need to feel comfortable with electronics 
We ve been using it for about a month now and no complaints  It was easy to hook up to our 4 different units  also it has a learn feature so if there is something that s not working right you can customize it and make it work better 
Learned the hard way  as had to reinstall stuffNo one told me that when I bought it
they thank me for thinking of they safety in getting warring of storms
Typing is wonderful  travel briefly and bluntly on the return trip  I love the new fn key layout  e g  I can with one hand press ctrl Fn F4 to close windows or fn FAny in other programs   software is definitively better tuned for tablet mode and this keyboard changes more diligently than the first gen type cover  The trackpad is definitively better but responds weird in certain software  mostly win32 apps with a lot of scrolling history  performance is wonky  I still think windows need several performance improvements while drawing graphics  it is slow and choppy on surface pro 3  I expect less delays in further builds 
It takes a little getting used to   but it works as advertised  Some of the menus could be more intuitive  But hey  I am old 
easy to install  very nice and slim  My only negative is that once it is installed the TV wobbles a little  but I would definetely recommended 
Just a heads up  this mount won t go 90 degrees out from the wall with a 65 TV  It seemed sturdy  but I didn t even try to put it together after I realized I had ordered the wrong mount I got a prompt refund from amazon  I mean that same day  Anyways  if you want to go 90 or even further  if you mount it on a corner like I did  you ll want the sanus Full motion   version  Yes  the plus is important 
Although it is a very good device to use  will take some time to orient myself to its buttons and functions  and allows me to use only one controller for all my entertainment needs  it is still very expensive  However I must say Alex of the Geek Squad was extremely knowledgeable of the equipment and very personable  He answered all my questions in a way that I could understand  He is a giant asset to your company 
Easy set up  Doesn t take up a bunch of real estate 
I never thought it would be this easy to program or to use  I would recommend this product to friends and family 
Best on gaming mouse If you get the chance  you will buy this mouse more 
The best feature with this remote is using the other electronic devices we own such as CD player  VHS player as well as DVD Blue Ray  It is simplified extremely well  We had good training from Geek Squad but still took some time to feel really comfortable 
Bought it to replace an old harmony  Paired it with my harmony hub  It s good but the price is a little you high for what it delivers 
I purchased this to replace my Harmony one  which I loved  This remote was more expensive and vastly inferior  The ergonomics are terrible  The remote cannot be operated effectively with one hand  To reach the hard buttons at the top  one invariably activates the touch screen by mistake  In general  there are too few hard buttons  like HELP  requiring you to look down at the touch screen unnecessarily  In addition  the touch screen is not sensitive enough and frequently does not recognize taps  The swipe feature  which is nice in theory  is also not sensitive and often requires do overs  After 4 months of babying  i e   not letting the kids use it   the top half of the touch screen no longer worked at all  Subsequently found out that free technical support in the US is only available for 90 days  unlike Europe and Asia  which have 2 years and 1 year free phone support respectively   Without technical support  I was close to returning this  but with a little self help persistence on the website  I was able to figure out how to reboot it  which solved the problem   Still  it should not have to be this difficult  Charging for technical support during the warranty period is a poor business model  Hope this company gets its act back together 
It is easy to set up and the software seems to be stable  but the overly complicated to operate and the buttons and small touch screen are all in the wrong place  its shape does not fit your hand and it is overpriced for what you get  You would never believe that this remote was made by the producer of the Harmony One 
wow   it is amazing  remote control
First of all  great system overall  nice clear highs  super low hits from sub  but I do have one issue and I don t know if this is supposed to happen or if I have a defective one  but every time there is a lot of bass in a song the air that the sub pushes out is delayed and it rattles to the point where it is very noticeable  so it kind of ruins the sound  Other than that  everything works perfect  If I could have someone tell me if that s meant to happen I would be happy though  Thank You 
I bought the other version of the keyboard and had to return it because it caused me contact dermatitis  I was hopeful that this luxury material would be comfortable  and it s not  Sure  at first it feels soft  but eventually  after spending a few minutes typing  and thus  moving my hands over it too   they start to burn a little  because of the keyboard s rough surface  I m very dissapointed about the materials they choose  Sure  they are marketed as luxurious  but they re not gentle for the skin  I absolutly love my surface pro 4  but I guess I will have to return it  because I can t seem to find keyboard that won t actually make me feel in pain 
I installed this in a Jeep Wrangler but it would get hot enough to burn skin after only 5 minutes running  I installed a different stereo wired the same with no issues  I think I got a defective one 
It does what it supposed to do  but too many steps involved  It isn t intuitive  I find myself needing to look at it instead of feeling for controls 
This stereo is actually water proof  It does not get good reception like the Kenwood I had  but the Kenwood was not even close to water proof Expect poor reception on the water if you buy this stereo 
Best remote ever  This is the second one I ve purchased  one for the bedroom setup and one for the living room  You ll never need another remote  It can control everything you can think of 
I m giving this remote three stars because I m sure it s great  but it didn t suit my needs  I have a Roku box instead of cable and this remote was incompatible  so I had to return it 
It can be a bit frustrating to use sometimes  Especially  when you are used to doing it with just one press from the device s remote directly But I no longer have to search for the remotes to change stuff now 
Very easy to use  good range of detection  compact device 
Work very well and my phone got charged fully to 100%
With u verse the remote would work but not access the DVR  Cryptic generic numeric message  On line blog erasedHad to return and order another  Best buy was great  Second one worked but have to disconnect all other computers on network to set up  Uverse knocks it down often with network settings changed must reset and if computers are connected it does not work  Must hard reset all u verse equipment with computers disconnected  Usual uverse  May have to buy a Cisco managed hub for  150  Currently disconnecting internet when not home 
I cant get this to work with my ps4 how do i get the two to work together 
This remote  is the absolute stupidest and non functioning thing I have ever experienced  We have only had it for less than 8 months and the screen that has the numbers on it  does not appear  and the remote does not respond to many things  Also the screen never goes off like it used to  and it runs out of battery quickly and is annoying having to let it charge for minutes before it can change channels  It seeped so interesting and advanced when I first saw and used it  but now it also does not let me turn the TV on unless I hit off first  and it s already off   ALSO  I have to ALWYAS go to  fix it myself  to change from TV to DVD  and the audio is always screwed up and never is synced to the right function  no matter how many times we have re synced and fixed it  after 3 uses  it goes back to not functioning properly  Furthermore  the price for this pice of *garbage*  is overly priced and inflated  this remote is so bad that they should pay YOU to get it  because there is no such thing as giving them negative money  so  it would just be them giving you money to get their screw up remote  I can go on and on about all of the things completely horrible about this remote  but to save you the reading  short review is  THIS IS THE WORST REMOTE IN THE HISTORY OF REMOTES This remote deserves NEGATIVE ratings  it s not even good enough for 1 star 
Love  love  love these speakers  The sound is so clear  I put this with a Sony amp  System is awesome 
we had the first unit which had the number pad  this unit does not have the number pad  or channel search by  page   It does have a  favorite  channel reserve  so is just another way of searching  but still like entering the channels by numbers 
Ok folks  this remote is IR only  so if your devices are hidden  this is not the remote for you  Get the Ultimate with the hub  I have been using this remote only a few days and I really love it  I love the fact that it s so easy to customize  Also  the review who said they have poor customer service is mind boggling to me since one I have recieved two phones call and multiple e mails and the personal cell phone of an exec over there in case I need input when I m re doing my media cabinet this weekend  If I could give 10 stars for customer service I would  The remote itself  it s early days yet but I really couldn t ask for anything better  It does exactly what I need it to do  BUT REMEMBER  THIS IS AN IR ONLY    If your devices are all visible it s the one for you  if not  get the one with the HUB 
Got an Iphone at the same day it came out at Apple 
Works well and holds a charge  I use it at work most days 
This product is top of the line  I travel frequently and use a desktop computer  With this wireless adapter I can pickup motel internet with ease  How many times have you gone to a motel that says they have high speed only to be drowned out by the other residents  The only reason I don t 5 start this product is price  It s not extremely high just up there  I have no complaints 
this product has brought internet to my home and cleared up any problems I was having
Quality picture  After turning on my old TV  it needed time before it would let me watch Netflix  Hulu  This TV gives me instant access to my smart TV apps  love it 
So far so good  Did have to remove the anti theft bracket in my application  Able to use without the app  unlike some others have said  going straight to my iTunes on my iPhone  Volume not as loud as I expected  Hooked up to a bazzooka tube marine model that is self amplified and really thumps  Lots of options that I haven t bothered with yet 
Upgraded MacBook Pro from 4GB to 8GB  Performance improved greatly and was fully compatible with Mid 2012 model 
I have 4 of these in my 01 Taurus and I m driving them via Pioneer DEH 3300UB  They can be turned all the way up and have almost no distortion  I have the EQ in my head unit customized to  6 Bass   2 Mid     3 Treble and my car rocks  I also turned the loudness and SLA all the way up and these speakers continue to impress    I love the 60 Watt RMS    which basically means Im underpowering them using my head unit which only puts out 25 watt RMS  I ll add a sub  amp combo later to get more Bass    but for right now    these are perfect
Installed the memory and so far it works as expected 
Slingbox doesn t have all cable boxes on website this its more of a challenge  Other than that  pretty simple to connect and SlingBox has GREAT customer service
I bought these speakers for my BMW X5 and had them installed by Best Buy  So far they sound great and I am satisfied with purchase  
Purchased this Signature keyboard just the other day  It s replacing an old Surface Pro 3 keyboard  In a word  this keyboard is inspiring  The aesthetic beauty  both in look and feel  of this keyboard inspires you to write  to do more work  to be more creative and productive  Definitely a recommended accessory 
These speakers are great  bang for the buck wise  I have these hooked up straight to the head unit  and they still sound great  Before I talk about the speakers  I ll tell you about my past experiences with car speakers I first replaced my front speakers with Kenwood KFC 1665 s that sounded much better  but not great  A bit later  I purchased JBL GX602 s from Best Buy  I splurged by spending over 100 bucks  thinking that they would sound great  and thinking the 2 ohm gimmick would let them be driven harder  Boy  was I wrong  The midbass was weak and distorted  mids felt recessed  and the tweeter had sibilance  sharp hissing S sounds  that cut into your eardrum and made them practically unlistenable  The speakers are pure marketing   the swiveling tweeters and plus one cone design are just gimmicks meant to make you think that they are worth more than they actually are  and pay 100 for a pair of speakers that sound worse than 40 50 ones  After about 2 weeks of owning them  I brought them back and exchanged them for these bad boys  which cost less than half the price  but sound twice as good  These Alpine s get louder off of the head unit  too  despite having a lower DB sensitivity rating of 88 5  versus 92 on the JBL s The lows are surpisingly clear and loud  and even on bass heavy songs  have very little distortion  You ll still want a sub  especially if you listen to hip hop or electronic music  but these aren t lacking in the lows  Midbass is tight and hits hard  The mids sound slightly veiled compared to other speakers I ve heard  but are still clear and clean  Upper mids are a bit harsh  but clear otherwise  and not at all obnoxious  These shine on the treble   The highs feel very clean  crisp  and clear without being too loud or harsh or having any sibilance  The staging is good  and there feels like there is more depth to the instruments than some car speakers I ve heard  The only complaint that I have is mounting   The basket is very thick and wide  and may not fit into some mounting brackets  not included  by the way  without some persuasion So in short  these speakers are absolutely 100 worth it for the price  However  the absolute most important thing of all is acoustically sealing your door  Since the panels are coming off anyways to put the new speakers in  peel back the plastic weatherproofing material on the inside of the door  Cut out pieces of wood  plastic  or even cardboard that fit over the large holes in the door  and seal them off  It can also be a good idea to cut out a piece of foam to fit between the door and side panel  as it absorbs rattles and keeps the soundwaves where they are supposed to be  Trust me  it sounds dumb  but for 20 minutes and 5 dollars these will go from sounding better than the stock speakers to sounding bonkers  in a good way 
I bought these speakers just over a year ago and they have been pumping out tunes daily ever since and I couldn t be any happier whether its for party s or just for everyday use these speakers have performed great  Now lets talk about the lights they have multiple different effects strobe being one of them every single time the bass hits everything flashes giving it a club ambiance which is extremely cool and is one of the reasons that when any friends come over they wonder where I purchased these speakers and how much they cost when I tell them the price its a pleasant surprise every time overall there great speakers to me and everyone that I know that has heard them    did I mention that set up took me only 10 minutes
Speaker being used in a very loud dirty environment  Its dust proof and loud enough to be heard over the noise in the room 
Just got this network adapter to go with my Asus nighthawk wireless router and its awesome  Definitely go with the 5 0 ghz side of it for the best speed possible  Its just as good as being hard wired in  Great range as well  
The sound is very clear and balance  The extra bass is incredible for such a small speaker  This nice equipment make sound as intended not noise as the other portable speakers around  The sound quality much better than Bose Mini  Very happy with this purchase 
I am hearing things with these headphones that I have never noticed before when listening to the same songs with other speakers or headphones 
These have such amazing sound and bonus  volume control
The Slingbox is an incredible product that allows you  or a family member  to watch either live or recoded programs on your home s TV from a remote location on a tablet  laptop  etc  For a minimal investment of  119  my son can watch all his favorite sports events while living abroad  The Slingbox is wifi ready  the set up is easy  and it is compatible with either cable or satellite TV  The only requirement is that the TV be connected to the Internet 
I was searching for a computer that could efficiently run the AUTOCAD suite and Microsoft Office  I can truly say the Dell XPS with the intel core i7 processor has more than been up to the challenge  I am running a demanding program like the AUTOCAD suite and Microsoft Office without sacrificing any speed or quality  I am incredibly impressed with this computer and highly recommend it for users who may have similar needs for performance 
Durable      very compact   you can fit a lot of things in it Very well built 
Simply the best on the market  If you don t buy them your missing out on some well built headphones with exceptional sound quality  A little
I purchased the item in order to increase memory on my MacBook
Purchased the memory cards for my son s MacBook  He needed increase memory 
We put this in our kitchen  It connects great  The sound is good  Not as good as a real stereo system but OK for just background music 
I love the convenience of having this keyboard  Although it sometimes doesn t read my finger print but when it does it s fast and easy 
The Harmony Ultimate One is a great universal remote  It will eliminate the need for all the remotes you currently have  even for products that are 20 years old  The programing isn t too complex  but it will take some getting use to  Some TVs that you use for local  over the air  don t use cable or satellite   won t be able to work with the touch screen Favorites  due to the subchannel system  The remote touchscreen is great feature  With less buttons to wear out  it should last for years  The buttons it does have are backlit  so it is good to use in the dark  It is also rechargeable  comes with a base for recharging   So it will save on batteries 
The touch and feed of keyboard is much improved over surface pro 3  I works well with the surface pro 3 and the fingerprint id works easily  Recommend 
works great  gives me a clearer sound and the price was good 
I had the Harmony One for years  then they offered a  trade in   So I got this unit because it has more options  more favorite channels  etc  It works  but I m using the HELP button a lot because it doesn t turn something off or on  I agree with another reviewer that the control buttons at the top are a design problem because it is too easy to inadvertently touch the touch screen underneath and change something  Controls should be at the bottom  Love that the unit is smaller and charges standing up so it has a smaller footprint  Overall I m satified to a three star rating 
Was in Florida on vacation and needed some tunes for the pool  Went to the local Best Buy and test listened to a few floor models  This one struck me as having the richest sound for the money  Purchased it and couldn t be happier  Connected to my phone very easily  Extra bass feature is nice for my tastes 
I was excited to open the Sony SRS XB30  as my previous bluetooth speaker was relatively cheap  and left a lot to be desired  sound wise So  opening up the box  which in itself is nice and tactile  you are greeted straight away by the speaker  No messing around  Pulled it out and powered it up  The indicator in the SongPal app  I ll get to that later  showed 50% charge  so that was great  meant I could use it right out of the box  Sync d it to my phone  without instructions  by pressing the big bluetooth button and then looking for it on my phone  just like you would with any other bluetooth device   Paired up really quickly  Chose my first song to play through it and away I went  Bam  The little speaker had a nice punch  straight out of the gate  I was very impressed  almost taken aback as I checked it out  Turned the volume up and it sounded great  Then  as anyone would  you HAVE to press the EXTRA BASS button  When you do  dual passive radiators work together with stereo full range speakers to enhance the low end tones  giving bass a nice boost  despite the speakers compact size  Basically  it sounds fantastic  However  I found that the speaker sounds fantastic  at a lower volume and when you are close to it  As I stepped away from the speaker and turned up the volume  the bass intensity dropped and more higher end sounds took precedence  I live in a moderately sized home with 25ft ceilings in the living room and the speaker was able to fill the room with sound  but didn t sound quite as bass backed as it did when the volume was lower and I was closer to it  However  I am still very impressed with what this speaker can do  considering it s size  On to the SongPal app    I opened it up and got the speaker hooked up to it  and from there you can change many settings on the speaker  It has an illuminated LED ring around it and two strobe lights  You can turn them on and off and you can control certain colors of the ring with predetermined color pattens within the app  But you cannot directly choose the color with a color wheel  You can also check battery status  power settings  adjust the EXTRA BASS and more  The unit claims a 24 hour battery life  when not using the lights on it  and so far  it s living up to it s claims  You can connect via bluetooth as mentioned or also via USB You can also link speakers  so if you have more than one of them  you can link them for stereo sounds  And if you want more  you can link up to 10 of them together for a full on party atmosphere  The speaker is also water resistant  not completely waterproof  So don t drop it in the pool and expect it to work  but it is splash proof and spill proof  so you can take it and use it at the beach as long as you make sure that the internal components cover is securely fastened  as Sony mentions many times in the instruction manual You can connect up to three devices to it as well  although I haven t tried this feature as I would only use it with my phone  I would love to see a power indicator on my phone as to how much power is left in the speaker  I use a pair of Sony Bluetooth Headphones  MDR XB70BT  every day and they provide a little icon showing how much charge is left in them on my phone  That would be useful with the speaker  as I may not always use the SongPal app when using the speaker  As for the SongPal app  I had an issue with the speaker connecting twice to it  and then not registering either of them  I had to erase the speakers and reconnect them  Not a deal breaker but it made the SongPal app feel a little clunky  It would be nice to have a color wheel to choose individual colors for the LED ring around the speaker  but again  not a deal breaker  but a nice to have feature  Overall I am very impressed with the Sony SRS XB30 Bluetooth Speaker and I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation

I auditioned all the premier outdoor speaker models and definitive technology rose to the top  These are replacing the massive Klipsch AW650 s that were damaged in an epic tennis ball sized hail storm  Funny thing  they share the same bracket    So no new holes required for our install  I ve got a Rotel 1075 powering these and they sound incredible 
My son bought this for a computer he was building  We were amazed by how this adapter increased his signal  Would definitely recommend it 
I ll get right into it PROS  Sound Isolating  Also know as Passive noise cancelling Active Noise Cancelling  ANC Ambient Noise   Allows you to hear a bit of background noise  a little  lot  or none at all Comfortable   Snug FitAPP   The JBL my Headphone app has 2 7 rating on App Store   You must be thinking  is this app really that bad? Could they have failed this hard? Well  the answer is yes and no  If you know how to use the app corectly  it is very useful and improves the quality of music tenfold  Jbl doesn t make any of this crystal clear  first off  the app ONLY works for the elites  and I m told the reflects as well  have only tried the elites with the app  Second  for the app to recognize your headphones they MUST be connected through Bluetooth  Not the aux cable  If you are wanting to utilize the app through a wired pair  then I m not really sure why you picked up a wireless set of headphones  Also in order to connect through Bluetooth wirelessly  the aux cable cannot be plugged into the headphones  The App is 4 8 stars for me  Improves the quality of music  and people who have given 1 star rating don t understand how to use the app  CONS  So far  not many  I will  however make you as informed as possible  The Fit   Headphone comfort varies from person to person  but to me they are very comfortable and snug fit  They do press on your head a bit but I prefer it  better passive noise cancelling against background noise  Size   They are a bit big  but they do fold up  and they come with a case as well  When Wired  When the battery is dead  the headphones still work with a wire  included   the App does not work  nor the awesome features of the headset  Sound goes to mediocre  Could be better  but I rarely plug them in because of 18 20 hr  battery life  Overall  4 8  5 starsHope my review helps you make a decision for the better  Feedback is welcome  and appreciated 
Excellent sound quality and very easy to use  Awesome 
I ve read in reviews that it works and it s also a match for the right type of memory  It fits just fine but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t so it s not compatible for Macbook pro mid 2009 even though it s the same specs  Unless I just got some bad memory  I m returning  As I said  The memory might be just fine but just incompatible  So I ll give 3 stars as I m not sure 100% what issue is 
The key positioning is good  the response to touch is good and the I really like the biometric logon 
I have a Harmony One that is now 10 years old and starting to have minor glitches  After thoughtful reading of reviews I ve decided to simply pay another 50 60 and get one of the remaining Harmony Ones instead of the Ultimate model  I can t handle getting calls at all times of day from family saying the TV won t go on  the channels won t change    etc etc  Hopefully Logitech will jump on this issue with so many people and come up with something much better 
I ve had this for 90 days in my 4 dr wrangler  I m 60% happy with it  The processor is very slow  Alpine went way cheap on this  it s laggy and a few of the apps don t work great  like Spotify  I find myself controlling the head unit with my phone more often than using the HU  When you turn it off the clock doesn t display  NO BLUETOOTH and it needs a mid range setting  It works fine for Apple maps  This is Alpines attempt at car play making an entry level HU lacking quality internal components but way over charging on price  If I had to do over I d buy the Pioneer version 
This has been a good speaker so far  We purchased it for use with groups  It puts out good volume with clarity 
Good value and reasonably good sound for the price
I was looking for a simple bluetooth speaker   this one worked well 
I needed to hire an IT  audio visual person to set up and program  Sometimes the commands don t work or my devices have a delay in responding and sometimes if I move or touch the Logitech  one of my devices reacts to a non command 
Great memory is in and works without a problem  Have a mid 2010 mac book pro which is what its in 
This remote is so simple to use and it works great  I have one for each of my TVs and they are great  If we want to watch TV we hit the touch screen button and the TV turns on  if we want to play games we hit the game button  It s that easy Also  you can put your favorite channels on the remote and all you have to do is hit the button and you are there 
This is a great product once you get it all set up  The set up process is a bit time consuming but once it is up and running it works great  If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote 
If sound could talk  this is how it would want to be heard  I can t think of another way to describe the B W P7s  Don t bother wasting your time with anything else  At the very least  order yourself a pair and take a listen  My money says that someone will have to pry them off your head before you ll be returning them  Pop  Rock  Hip Hop to Jazz  pick your genre  Anything you throw at them  they ll deliver results unlike anything you have ever experience  These headphones will make you love your music again 
This product is a perfect example of BAD Ergonomic Design For some reason  Harmony redesigned the interface from its Harmony One remote and its very awkward and un balanced in the hand when using it Just some of the issues Ive experienced  Touch screen must be swiped in a motion that is different from your phone  so it is awkward and must be done many times to get it right  There are no numbers to change channels and its impossible to find them on the touchscreen  When you want to pause a program  or rewind it  the controls are out of reach of your thumb and then the unit is un balanced in the hand  You end up having to use both hands  The Guide button  which is used by all the cable and satellite companies to navigate the channels  is way out of comfortable range So  I get wanting to make the product NEW and different from its previous models  but there is an old adage  If its aint broke  dont fix it The original Harmony One was really a perfect remote and I implore Harmony to go back to that model  because the new designs are really BAD 
If I could give zero stars I would  TV showed a day late and I pulled it out of the box  set it up then plugged it in and it has no picture  just sound 
I just received TV I had a friend set it up  I have not connected my computer yet I will in a few days  Getting a new laptop  The reason why I am writing this review now is to let you know that the TV comes just like the picture  I dont know why it says it doesnt because the TV and the picture you see are identical 
If it had Bluetooth and  or you were able to connect Carplay wirelessly  it would be the perfect head unit for those who want a Carplay  FM AM Only stereo 
So I got a new surface 4 and it d be crazy not to have a keyboard  The keys are springy  but they are a bit click y so don t think you re going to type like a ninja  I was bummed it only came in black with the fingerprint ID but it works well so it was worth the trade off 
This is the third Logitech remote I have purchased this year  I have had nothing but trouble with it  I try to turn the volume on and it goes on mute  When I try to turn it up it goes on it s blaring   I have two other remotes and they take AA batteries  This one you have to charge up every other day   The Logitech I have in the bedroom has lasted 7 years  And I only charge that one only once a week  I have a 2 year extended warranty on it   but the last one I had a 2 yr warranty on it and the Geek Squad hassled me about reinstalling it for free 
I bought one without the finger print reader and 2 with  MS Hello is a great way to login but I prefer the fingerprint reader as I assign different fingers to my home and work users so that I can instantly login to either account with just a touch 
I wasn t too sure about this item when I  First purchased it  However once I got it home and set up to be wireless  It worked wonderfully  I could walk around with no wires and my husband could watch his sports games while I listened to music on my iPad  And it drowned out the TV  I would highly recommend this item 
If high tech stone age way of changing channels appeals to you this is your way to go  I think the up or down button is going to wear out before i end of deep sixing the thing  Did not realize you could not go to a numbered channel directly  You must scroll 
This is a very expensive unit and is supposed to replace all controllers but it doesn t do that  Is complicated to use very small and hard to handle and operate 
In theory  it s nice    the touch screen is nice  the channel listing is nice  it feels solid in your hand But    Inconsistent results  TV and stereo are often left in unexpected states  on when the remote thinks they re off  or off when the remote thinks they re on   And there s no simple process to correct   a series of simple steps  yes  but you have to know what you re doing  Also  the rounded bottom means that you can t press buttons unless you re holding the device    it just rocks too much to press buttons while it s sitting on a table 
I purchased this RAM to add to my new Dell computer  The packaging is very misleading  saying that it is 2400 MHz compatible with both 2100 and 2400 DDR4  my Dell runs at 2400   Installed the new RAM and the computer became unstable very quickly  Was with tech support for a day   checked everything  reinstalled the operating system  everything    Nearly reboxed the computer when I decided to pull the RAM to see what speed it was actually running at  Dell ran at 2400  Pulled it and installed this in the same slots  it ran at 2100  Once I pulled this and reinstalled the OEM  never had another problem  including after purchasing additional Dell RAM  
It doesn t work for everything  Will not recognize my Bose soundbar  I got it to not have to use all my remotes and I still have to use most of them  I can t get to netflix without the TV remote  Also the buttons are really small and slippery so my finger slides off a lot  I would love to send this back but missed the deadline by 4 days 
Setup was easy  has the features I was looking for  The biggest setback for me is the screen  The favorite icons are too small  My client has arthritis  and didn t realize how hard it is for him to navigate through that screen or even to press the numbers on the screen 
After my previous One broke  I got this remote  I wish I had my old one  It s cumbersome and sometimes just completely goes nuts adjusting the volume to the loudest position even when I m not pressing the button  The touchscreen controls for FFWD    RWD    PLAY don t work consistently  I often swipe for FFWD and have to touch the screen repeatedly for the PLAY to work by that time I have to rewind a long way to get where I wanted it  The buttons are in awkward  unintuitive positions  My whole family complains about this remote 
Found mini DV s which are hard to find these days 
I put together a new entertainment system in 2012  A big jump  for me  with AV receiver  DVR  Blu Ray  Apple TV and flat screen   Ordered from Amazon and very satisfied   Even though I feel pretty comfortable with most tech and gadgets  I paid for Geek Squad to set everything up  and for me  this was worth it  When done  they went over the Harmony 890 remote with me  and I was great  until it stopped working  Volume button worn out  I think  so I researched and thought the upgrade would be OK  and I d give setting it up a try Wrong  The app that controls this had been upgraded  so that had to be done  An additional step of some silverlight software had to be installed also  why couldn t they have included that step for me  The software allows for transferring settings  which seemed great  until it didn t really include all steps  Guess I was going to learn how to set this remote up after all  But then  I realized that this unit would not work with the RF from my older 890  This is on me   I should ve researched a bit more So now  am I gonna spend more money  on an overpriced item to upgrade to their hub Nope  I will try to find a used or refurbished 890 that will work with my current RF extender and all the settings are working  The 890 does everything I want it to  It has enough flexibility to suit me  and is a huge improvement over multiple remotes I don t upgrade my entertainment system that often  If down the road I need to update  I will find a teenager or use Geek Squad and avoid tremendous frustration  I ve wasted close to 6 hours trying to get this to work  and it is clearly beyond my ability  As I look back on the reviews  many of the favorable commenters mention is some way the complexity in setting these up  I really don t think this needs to be the case  I really believe that the process could be much easier than it is  I hope your experience is better than mine   that you set it up adequately the first time  that you re able to do it easily and quickly  and that it works the way you want it to work 
I upgraded a previous Sony on my boat  It does the job  but be aware that the respective harnesses don t connect  so a lot of individual connectors   
This is my third Logitech Harmony remote  I don t care for the design of this one compared to previous models  Eliminate the number pad on a remote ? really?? Favorites are a very nice feature  but don t replace the need for a number pad and I don t care for the one offered on the touch screen   my husband HATES it   Setup was tough since I already had the  software  installed on my laptop and the the packinging  instructions did not make it clear that you needed to download and install NEW software from a different vendor  Took a phone call to support to get it cleared up  I find it very odd  and a poor design decision  that you can t manage all of the features from the software  Some things you have to do on the remote  some things in the software  CONFUSING  All in all   I just don t care for this release which is a shame because I have loved this line of removtes  Once I got the proper software installed   setup was easy and straightforward as I have come to expect from Logitech  The remote has been mostly reliable and has mostly worked properly  I wish I had a new purchase my old Harmony One   
I recommend this remote to anyone looking to combine all their electronics with one remote 
This product works well with my 55  TV  I considered a heavier and more expensive type but am happy with this model 
I really like the blue color  It has some good options for the EQ and the display  It did not come with what I needed for the F  M radio to work  I ve had it for 3 4 months and some of the buttons sometimes do not respond sometimes  I like it when it works correctly 
I upgraded to this from a Harmony One  which I loved but was just starting to feel kind of old  I read a lot of reviews and complaints about this model s button layout  I figured people were just exagerating  how hard can it be to learn a new layout and get used to the play pause controls being at the top of the remote instead of the middle  You have to hold the remote by the top to use the commands  but thats not the big problem for me  Instead its the brain dead designers that put the power button millimeters above the similarly shaped rewind button  The number of times I ve accidently shut my whole system off while trying to quickly rewind something    extremely frustrating Another issue with holding the remote at the top to use the play pause controls is that your thumb or hand will often press the touch screen  This is a design flaw they tried to solve by putting a lock on the touch screen  When the touch screen activates you have to slide the lock screen over to use the touch buttons  This got old real fast  it adds an annoying extra step to trying to use your fancy  supposedly  convienent universal remote  Disabling the lock screen  however  means that my remote s touch screen is constantly ending up on the numeric or favorites page for some reason  Two pages I never use and wish I could just turn off or hide  but cant And finally  the biggest problem with this remote  The battery  The Harmony One s battery lasted forever and when it was running low  the remote would smartly remind you to recharge it  This new Harmony lasts a few days if youre lucky  and has no charging reminder  So I ll use it for two days the battery indicator around 70  then the next days its completely dead and wont even turn on  So you cant use your remote until its gotten enough charge to function  If you remember to ALWAYS put the remote on the charger when youre not using it  this wont be an issue  But for me its a constant and frustrating problem with an overall poorly designed and bad upgrade of a once excellent universal remote 
I purchased a Vizio but the display went bad and had to replace my TV asap  I had my doubts about Samsung products because I had some issues before but  this had some great reviews and wasn t too expensive  I am glad I decided on purchasing this TV  It has great color and I have had no issues with it since I purchased it  The only thing that was a little difficult was setting up the WiFi and the updates that needed to be completes before I could use it  It did take awhile and my router kept booting me off because the TV s WiFi kept buffering  Once I got passed that point  it was all smooth sailing  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is in need of a great Smart TV that is cost effective 
I bought this as a replacement for the old Harmony One because the touchscreen got crunched  I pretty much hated it  I went out and bought another old one  for about 100 more  because it is so much better  the old version  I definitely don t recommend this remote  I do recommend the older  discontinued  Harmony One  I gave it two satrs because it does function as a universal remote  Maybe it works for other people 
I never write reviews  but I felt I had to for this remote  I was the owner of a Logitech Harmony One for several years prior to purchasing this remote  I loved the One  it was reliable  easy to use  and felt nice in the hand  I have been using the Ultimate One for well a year now  and for the price this remote falls short First was the set up  Logitech switched to a new program  so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch  I feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program  This added a good amount of time to the set up  The remote itself looks great  and is lightweight  However  it does not feel as ergonomic as the One did  It is also lacking the number buttons  which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote  You have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you want When it comes to functionality the remote really falls short  I purchased the 100 hub to control my PS3  The remote constantly loses its pairing with the system  I am them forced to get the PS3 controller and re register the blu tooth device all over again  It defeats the entire purpose of the remote  It is also not uncommon for the remote and HUB itself to lose their pairing  Forcing you to either restart the HUB or connect the remote to a computer and reset it The remote also has not had the ability to connect to a PS4 until recently  and it still can not turn the system on  off  If I still need to go to the system or use my PS remote  what is the use of the universal remote The remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my One did  Making me either press the help button  go into the devices and fix it myself  or physically get up and turn a component on of off I would have given my One five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is  For the 350 I paid when it was new  including the HUB   this is a real let down ***Update 4  29  16***Somehow this remote has become even less functional  As noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote  The icons are now completely useless  For example if I want to change to channel 44 1 I press the icon button because I do not want to scroll through 20 channels  and the on screen numbers do not work well  The first press will get me 4 1  Next 1  then 4 1  then  1  then 44  Finally I m at a channel that I can just scroll to  Sometimes it never even gets close and I will just scroll through all the channels  I make sure to keep the remote pointed directly at the TV  and give it time between button presses but nothing works  I am changing my review to one star 
This is a train wreck  I loved the 880  and gave many as gifts   I really loved the One  This thing is terrible  Bad ergonomics  bad button placement  and WAY TOO MUCH TOUCHSCREEN with not enough physical buttons  After 6 months  I m giving up and putting it in a drawer  I ve found myself using the Harmony to turn everything on  off and the Comcast remote for everything else  That s how bad this is 
Just rubbish  I have bought about 10 Logitech remotes over the last years for myself and friends  I loved the 700  which I still have in my living room system and my bedroom  I was tempted by the Ultimate One for my new home cinema  installed just over a year ago  75 UHDTV  Martin Logan speakers  Pioneer Elite receiver  Oppo  Roku  Cambridge audio CD player   It looked sexy  However  the touch screen function often scrolls badly and can cause wrong selections the push button commands are placed stupidly the cradle connects badly the unit just died on me after 14 months   wont charge  and alternatively tells me low battery or fully chargedTough on me those 14 months  since the warranty  when you check it out  is only 12 months  Lousy product  I am replacing it by a 650  This product replaces the 700 which is discontinued  but is unfortunately not rechargeable  why did Logitech decide to go non rechargeable   At least the on line software remains great  and I can transfer my devices and activities easily 
At first I must accept that I did not have many expectations of my purchase with Sony  but turned out to be much more and overcome all my ideas of it  I like the color and form so easy it connects to Bluetooth devices  The size is perfect and I can take it wherever I want  I can rate it as Excellent buy 
WOW  I love this thing  This is my 4th Harmony   2 Harmony One s  1 Harmony 650  and this new Ultimate One  They have all been great  but the new Ultimate is just that  ULTIMATE  It is incredibly simple to setup and use  It even lists all of the cable channels for most cable companies along with their station number and icon when you setup your favorites  point and click  Building command sets or macro s is a very simple process if you even need that  and they have simplified setting up special keys on the keyboard and screen  it is great  Not a glitch during setup  If you like me want to copy your old configuration from the old to the new  it can do that  however it is not able to transfer favorites for you  or special key assignments  but with the new process for adding favorites and the fact that you get more favorites it is a snap The new thing I like most is the screen gestures  Learning them makes the remote incredibly easy to use  You don t even have to look down at the remote for most common changes  I have seen several bad reviews on this remote on Amazon  I really don t understand why  I m 68 years old  not a mental giant and this was a snap  Don t let them scare you off 
I was looking for a new Bluetooth speaker and saw this on sale for 80 bucks  This is perfect for someone that wants to take it to a pool party or playing music in the shower  I do both but also take it when i travel for work or a weekend getaway 
I use this speaker on the go all the time  very compact  yet great sound 
If you have a complex entertainment center  then you need a Harmony remote and this is the best one out their  Only down fall is the Blu Ray functions are a little hard to use as the buttons are at the top of the remote and a little small  However  I would buy this remote again in a heart beat    
It replaced 5 remotes for different devices  Easy to program  Easy to use  My whole family can now run all the equipment  tv  DVR  cable box  receiver  Apple TV  video games  without me 
I love this remote  It synced with my TV  cable box and sonos sound bar  I can now control all my devices with one remote  It also allows me to use my smart tv functions like Netflix  Amazon  and Hulu  Great remote 
I really don t get people  Are the complainers old Logitech Remote Users that can not adapt to change I don t know    but almost didn t buy it due to the complainers  I LOVE this remote  Ok  ok   I was disappointed I couldn t control the Lutron Caseta lights out of the box  looks like I will have to buy the bridge in order for the remote to work with the lighting  AND when using the remote with the Denon amp for the surround sound  when changing the inputs from CD to TV surround sound I did have to add a power delay in the programming in order for the input to change over properly every time but if you read and put a little effort  the remote is simply perfect The only drawbacks You still need a bridge to control your Lutron home lighting with the remoteYou need to read and put a little effort into setting up the remote  including the inputs when changing from CD to Surround Sound TV  etcThe Favorites  I use this remote with two TVs at this point and the Favorites only work on the original TV I set it up for  this is actually annoying and can be easily fixed with a software update  Logitech  I hope you fix this  I still rate this 5 stars and really think its awesome  As for the layout and contour of the remote   perfect  Give it a try  I am sure you will like it 
Ive owned numerous Logitech remotes but this one hands down is awesome  I love the home screen allows you touch the channel you want to watch and itll hold up to 75 channels to touch and itll turn to that channel  Its so sick
super sleek  easy to use  I just love it super easy to use 
This is lightweight and very responsive  I especially like the lighted key function  Excellent unit 
The fingerprint I d makes loggin in so much quicker 
This computer has so many features that I wanted in a computer  at a reasonable price  My son offered to build me a computer with what I needed  but when I found this  at about the same price  and ready to go  I jumped at it  It has lots of USB 3 ports  8   one 3 1 port  and two 2 0 ports  so that I can plug in all my external drives that I store my pictures on  printers  mouse and keyboard  plus have extra ports   Four of the ports are in front  which makes for easy access to changing what goes into those  I also like the 16G of memory which makes working with Photoshop and Lightroom go very fast  even if I have other programs open  The design is sleek and simple  I replaced the video card because I needed one that worked with all the Photoshop functions  and it was very easy to open the box  use the swing out power supply to access the card and replace it  So far I am very happy and impressed with this Dell XPS 
I love everything about this bag I feel that my 5D IV and lenses are safe and secure  but if you don t pay attention  the clips will slip off of the waist straps  That is a vital detail when utilizing the flip side while the shoulder straps are not in use
Great headphones  Comfortable and very good sound 
I found these and looking at the reviews on them  I decided to order them  I thought because they are wireless there would be some kind of bass lost when listening I listen to a large amount of Dubstep  Electro  the sound quality it great   Very comfortable  and with the volume control  call and skip buttons  you basically don t need to touch your music playing device at all  I Highly suggest you buy these  I really love mine  Worth the price and better than going and buying  200 Beats
I love the sound and the bass  It was worth every penny  I love the colors that come out of the stereo while the music plays 
This is the best remote I have had as it does everything I want  its easy to use and the whole family has figured this oneThanks
I love my Surface Pro  and I especially love this keyboard  It is very light  the keys are responsive  It is a very good buy  and I am very pleased with this purchase 
The picture is so clear  the colors are bright  It�s perfect 
I love slingboxes however  this is my third or forth unit  They do not handle power spikes after a power outage  I would recommend the geek squad protection it has saved me 
Easy to hook up and use in the house  I even go to sleep listening to my music  Love it 
I love Logitech I have 650 now I buy harmony ultimate touch screen I love it if you you whant to buy remote this is the one
If you can make the time to Programe this devise  it is an amazingly simple thing to use  I love it 
What is there to say when there are multiple reviews of this item on YouTube showing it s the best speaker? Thanks to Best buy for putting it on sale  I love it 
This is my second Harmony remote   I have the Harmony 650 as well   and I love them both  After a tiny bit of trouble initially setting up the remote  everything went smoothly and perfectly  The Ultimate 1 allows you to use up to 15 devices and I am currently using 10 in my home theater setup including an A  V receiver  a PS3  an Xbox 360  two BluRay DVD players  a cd changer  and my HD DVR cable box  Everything is working perfectly  I intend to buy the Harmony Ultimate Hub next 
This really is an awesome remote and I have always had very good experiences with Logitech products  Customize buttons  color touch screen buttons  very smart remote  For me it was well worth the price 
Bought this remote because of other people in my family   they were unable to operate the TV with the sound system with the streaming player with the DVD player  I would get phone calls at work   what input what box HDMI which remote is for thatThis remote allows you to power on what you want and set the right inputs with one button  When it works   it s great You can control individual devices AND you can make Activities happen  For example Watch Netflix   turns on my TV sets it to HDMI1  Turns on the sound bar and sets it to DVD Turns on the DVD player  which also streams my Netflix  You can also go even further and have the DVD remote go right a selection  and okay so the actual Netflix app pis selected  This part is a bit more finicky because it depends at what point the DVD starts up   if it doesn t always start up at the same place it would go right a selection and okay to the wrong app  Hope that made sense Other features You can add an icon to the activity you createYou can individually program buttons to what you want when in a certain activity  e g  a short press can do something on the DVD player  while a long press can do something else on the sound barWhy I m knocking stars off For some reason that I haven t quite figured out  things don t ALWAYS turn on when they are supposed to or inputs don t go to the right input  It goes to HDMI2 when its supposed to be HDMI1   These errors maybe happen 10 of the time   but still wish they wouldn t happen at all  Because then I ll get a phone call Next to the favorites button and the home button   I wish there was a devices button where it would go to your options of which device you want to control  Right now you can do that  but you have to go through a not so obvious way  Which REALLy sucks when its my family members trying to figure out how to control a certain device  And since certain devices don t turn on  it would have been great if it it were easy to just power on the TV with the Logitech 
Great buy loud functional  Just love it  Been jamming ever since i bought it
like it this product
This deck is really great  I love the Bluetooth functionality
Speakers sounded harsh  Replaced two with JBLs and left two Alpine  Will replace the Alpine with JBLs at a later date 
It s not often that I write a REALLY negative review of a product but in this case I m going to make an exception  I have been through 3 Harmony Ultimate One remotes since May of  17  In every case the device itself was defective  I ve been on the phone with Harmony s support group for over five hours total trying to figure out why the devices continuously either do not work on start up period or works for less than a month consecutively  The download of software refused to communicate with the device  the ability to transfer functions from one device that was set up correctly was impossible due to software issues and over the last two days I have returned TWO devices that both were defective  Look  I liked the intuitive way that the remote worked and was trying to find a remote that my wife could operate without a degree in computer language and serious complexity issues  Harmony s support folks were very nice and were very willing to send me a replacement  three times   but at some point it s important to call it a day and look for a remote that s simple  operates multiple devices and doesn t result in wanting to kick the dog and drink heavily 
exceptional keyboard I think it looks nice works nice and acts as a non skid pad when using as a tablet  protects the screen as well
The touch screen is too touchy  I like may old Harmony 880 
I do like this bag but       the one thing I would change is being able to access it from the outside instead of always taking it off laying it down to unzip the inside to get something  It fits my gear and is comfortable to wear 
I like these a lot  I am a hard core Bose lover buy when I saw these on a deal of the day I decided to give them a go  They are great to watch movies with and study 
makes using my tablet easier  Not used to the touchscreen technology yet  just wish it had a number pad 
So far so good with this RAM  I ve only been using it for a month now but no issues at all and works as it should    I would buy again 
Nice size for a bedroom or study  Great price grandson uses it daily 
This portable speaker has a clear crisp sound the volume is wonderful  It�s easy to transport to the beach use in the backyard or anywhere  I�m very happy with this purchase
Seems like it works fine  but I haven t really used it yet  I m just using the onscreen keyboard when I need to type something 
This an upgrade to the latest version  The new version woks great so far 
Not very functional  I have owned a Harmony One for many years and absolutely LOVE it  I did not like the Ultimate One AT ALL  I ended up paying extra for a new  discontinued Harmony One  On the Ultimate One there are very few hard buttons  Anytime you want to do anything you have to swipe    flip through the screens to get to the section you want then push the soft button  Also  it is too sensitive and you end up pushing something you didn t intend to  They do have a lock feature for the screen but THEN you have to unlock the screen THEN swipe    flip to the screen you need to find the function    feature you want  I m begging Logitech to focus on making the Harmony One better    they really came up with a winner on that one 
I have a bose sound system and so far  I have been unable to get the remote to work with this system  For some reason  it does not want to work with it 
doesnt work with roku  i hate how it turns everything off when you select a new input   sometimes i jsut want it to turn it on  but it has to turn everything else off first    get it fixed
I love it  It looks beautiful  feels great and I am really happy with it  I love the color and the lighted keys 
Not sure what happened to the Harmony Remotes  I had the Harmony One Remote and it was the best remote I ever had  This remote was DOA  I charged it to 100  Loaded the software  When I tried to sync the remote  it wasn t recognized  I did everything that other users have done via the community site  Different computers with different Operating Systems  different USB ports  Nothing  Still would not sync  Returning it back to Amazon 
PRODUCT DIDN T WORK AS DIRECTED AT FIRST BUT AFTER A CALL TO CUSTOMER SERVICE A TECHNICIAN WAS ABLE TO GUIDE ME THROUGH THE SETUP   NOTE     YOUR WI FI SHOULD BE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE OR YOU GET BUFFERING THAT IMPEDES THE PRODUCTS EFFECTIVENESS    
It works well  but I had higher expectations 1  Only can record or play back one show2  limited to one tuner and TV3  Requires high upload internet speeds from your home network4  when using remote from your remote device  picture will skip5  only One device can review Play back 6  No HDMI connection    what the heck this is 2015 7  The free version of their playback app for your device has Ads and their not Ad player is pricy I bought this to stream from my direct TV to my office  The box will upload the content from your internet to their servers  Then you can view the content on your device that is streamed by their servers  For me  this is a heavy load on my network traffic because it is coming back and forth to the modem  router  I attach everything with Ethernet cable on a 1gb LAN  but still get choppy video s  video single lost or message internet connection is poor  I have not had time to research this but suspect my modem is the bottle neck  It is supplied by Grande and I suspect they are designed more for download then upload speeds On the Positive side it does work  and you can power on your tuner remotely from their app  This handy if you device is in power saving mode I am saying No to recommend  but ask someone if they asked how are they going to use it and then give pros and cons
I had a better one in other room same brand better build double the price  if you don t move it a often  I guess it good  but if you want to pull out everytime  I would not buy this one 
I don t normally write product reviews  but seeing all the negative reviews  I felt I had to chime in I recently purchased this to replace a broken Harmony 880 that I had for years  I have to admit  I don t understand all the negative comments about this device  I found it incredibly easy to setup  though that may be because I just had to port over my 880 settings  The setup software is relatively simple and straightforward I find the button layout actually preferable to my 880  I didn t like how all the control buttons were so low on the 880 and like having them higher up on the Ultimate One  I also find the touch screen quick and reponsive  and I LOVE how it is editable directly on the remote  With the 880 I would have had to connected it back to a PC to do a simple button edit  With this  I can edit directly on the device and quickly customize the locations of each button I will say the main negative I have found is lacking control for Roku and Amazon fire  though the 880 had that same issue  I have an HTPC so I don t use those other devices often  so it may be a bigger deal to others 
I find it hard to handle and use  the programmed channels never work with out trying 6 times  even when using the numbers screen you have to try sometimes 3 or 4 times before you get the channel you want 
Go ahead and protect that Surface of yours and use the fingerprint reader keyboard to save time logging in to your Surface  Took a little bit of practice to learn how to press your finger to get just the right reading but now I m in and using it much faster than any password 
Need to be better sound because it sound bad jsjiskkw
I had an older version that was expensive  Loved it  This one  well   some of the buttons dont work  My Cox Cable box cannot be used by this remote  I think the thing that really bothers me is that the battery inside the remote is not changeable  It sits on a charging cradle  but you cant replace the battery to the remote like the older one  So I guess at that point you would toss it out? And the Geek Squad said dont leave it in the charging cradle since that will eat up the battery life  Leave it off till the battery gets really really low then put it back on the charger  Well  great  I always leave mine in the cradle when not in use  So I am going to go back and see what other options i have and go from there  Either way some of the buttons do not work   they are supposed to  And for some reason I thought newer model perhaps newer better options  Not the case  Actually less than my other one  Go figure 
This is an amazing device that operates 5 devices in my case and works flawlessly  I could not be happier to get rid of the pile of remotes 
Using this remote to control anthing you will see a very noticeable delay  fast forwarding through commercials is terrible  The touchscreen makes navigation terrible  constantly forcing you to look back at the remote  It must be charged much more often than you would need to change a regular remotes batteries Please do not buy this product 
Its better than my other harmony remote which had wore out buttons but I should have done a hands on before purchasing
I returned and went back to my Harmony 650 s  It just didn t seem as intuitive 
I have several components that are identical being used in the same setup  See pic  Sony produced 400 disc DVD and Blu Ray players  They thought ahead and added a switch to the remote that would change the IR frequency and re program the players to do the same I was concerned about programing the Harmony One to control these individually  After about an hour of setting and tweaking  they work flawlessly The remote is set up to turn on a player  turn on and switch inputs of both the receiver and TV with the push of one button set up in the touch screen  You need to make sure you have your remotes as the Harmony One sets up to the most popular frequency and The Harmony One is a learning remote  so while plugged in to your PC  follow instructions by pointing your remote to the Harmony One and it will learn the IR frequency of that remote 
The sound is so crisp and clear  it s hard to believe it s a single small speaker  it s perfect for my backyard gatherings  Everyone was so amazed by the sound 
it works  but i thought there would be no wires  so i wish i had just purchased home security cameras
I bought this camera and I can t get the talk feature to work  I get an error message something like  press to talk failed  
Nice upgrade compared to my harmony 650  Has way more features
Great sound  low price  What else can I say  If you are looking for speakers I would highly recommend these  Crystal clear sound deep powerful base  Best 6 5 speakers I ve ever bought 
I am totally satisfied with the speakers  In fact  I want to buy same speakers for my wife s car 
I am enjoying this product with my Surface Pro  If Microsoft can make universal Keyboards that are compatible with other non Microsoft Products like Samsung  Sony  Apple etc   they can beat the market Good luck Microsoft   
This is an awsom speaker  I love it  good siu do quality  It s actully better then beats pill
My daughter asked for one thing for Christmas   a new car stereo  Her 2002 Chrysler had a thin  tiny sounding stock radio  Tried different eq settings to no avail  Read some reviews and noticed this Sony had 5 stars  It s a marine radio designed for a boat that probably doesn t have a hard roof  I figured if it sounds good in the great outdoors  it ll sound better with some walls to bounce off of  It does  My daughter loves it  It has all the features she wanted to be able to play her music  The sound is full and gets better as it s cranked  I appreciate BestBuy s policy of uninstalling it for free as it will easily outlive my daughter s Chrysler and then be moved to a different vehicle  Oh  very important  some previous review or question said you cannot change colors  This is wrong  My daughter has hers in a beautiful blue   very sharp 
My old type cover  for Surface Pro 3  finally gave out after I d pounded away on it for a few years  might have been the dog fur that got inside   and I had to replace it  I bought the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with fingerprint technology and it works GREAT with my Surface Pro 3  HIGHLY recommend it  The feel and sound of the keys is much more like a regular keyboard  and I love the fingerprint for signing in  etc 
I replaced my front door speakers with the 6x9 Alpines  I wanted my back speakers to match  The whole system sounds so much better than the factory speakers  I love it 
All devices   controlled by one remote  Easy to program  Easy to use  5 remotes condensed into one 
I ve owned five Harmony remotes before this one  Before now  the setup has always been a no brainer  I just finished the setup for this remote and it took me almost three hours  After all those hours I m still completely dissatisfied For starters  I had a very annoying problem with the initial setup  I could set up all of the devices and the activities  but then it would take forever to sync  It would hang at about 20 30 and never get past that point  I searched through many Logitech forums and found some suggestions that seemed to kind of help  but never quite got to 100  I even tried a different PC  which was strange because instead of using the same web based installer it made me install the MyHarmony app on my other PC  same versions of Windows 7   no idea why it wouldn t use the same installer   Sitting at that different PC I finally got the idea to swap out a different USB cable  It turned out that the cheap stock USB cable had a bad micro USB connector  My AmazonBasics USB cable worked though After that I was able to sync reliably every time  Then I had to make quite a few more changes and sync and re sync Now that it s completely set up  there s still one annoyance I can t resolve  Every time I launch the Watch TV activity  the main activity that I want to use this remote for  it changes the input on my TV  Then I have to manually change the input on the TV back to the right HDMI input  If this is an intelligent remote  it should know that the last activity was Watch TV and that there s no reason to change the input  I have no clue why it tries to change the input every time  and every time it picks the wrong one If I switch from Watch TV to Watch Movie  it will operate my DVD player correctly  but again it picks some random  and wrong   input on the TV  It s very frustrating Aside from these frustrations  I don t like the form factor or the layout on this Harmony remote as much as I liked my previous Harmony remotes  The LCD screen gets very dirty  It defaults to a weird home page that I don t like I m very frustrated  It feels like their Harmony product line has gone the wrong direction over the years  I hope they can correct their course  because I m a long time fan of these remotes 
Phenomenal so easy to use  so awesome to keep signal as driving in car crossing the State
I m loving it s so easy to use  I use this for work and I can use my laptop anywhere  My job requires me to drive to many different schools all over 
Logitech sent me this as a replacement due to a swollen battery issue in my Harmony One remote  I thought wow  what great customer service  they sent me a brand new remote with no questions asked  After using it a few times  it s easy to figure out why  1st the good  Small    Easy to grip Easy to set up  especially favorite channelsNow the bad  The layout is horrible  With buttons at both above and below the touch screen  navigation is very awkward  There are no numeral buttons on the remote itself  You have to swipe through a few menus on the touchscreen to access them   You cannot access the battery easily  if you need a replacement Overall this is an okay remote  but for the price they charge  I would still try to find a Harmony One remote  This older model is easier to use than the Ultimate One  Hopefully Logitech will design a new model to replace this model 
TV   Pic is as expected   unfortunately the samsung  universal remote  will not send signal to my Verizon FIOS cable box to change channels  Samsung tech support could not assist  Geek Squad will only help if I pay for an in home session  Can t believe that a  smart TV  comes with a controller that can t talk to the cable box  Very likely bringing this one back to the store for a refund 
You must look at the device at all times  It is not designed in a way that your finger tips will recognize the individual keyboard functions 
5 hours later     would not recognize a visio soundbar or the Visio company for that matter  Software is a nightmare  Horrible for user friendly  Taking it back to store  Logitech is a great company  but seriously bombed on this remote  DO NOT BUY this remote  It will test your patience and ruin your day
I m sorry to say that I thought this remote was junk and am returning it after a few weeks of use  I know it looks tempting  I know it looks slick  it s certainly nicely packaged  but it s a horrible product The number one thing a remote maker has to get right in my opinion is the ergonomics  feel and balance of the unit  Those of us that watch a lot of TV  for better or worse   have this thing in our hands a lot of the time  and it needs to feel right  The Ultimate One fails immediately in this regard  The weight and balance is just off  making it awkward to use the touch screen and gestures  and the top buttons  which are actually used a lot when watching shows on DVR  feel uncomfortable and out of reach  The unit feels constantly as though it is tipping forward or back  It s hard to describe  but it just doesn t sit right  I have large hands  and my wife s hands are pretty small  but we both became very frustrated with this remote after trying to use it for a few weeks  The fuzzy material on the bottom of the unit is a bad choice too  I m not sure whether it s trying to have a leather like feel  but it feels like I m holding a loofah  I get it that everyone is different  but I really feel like Logitech  who really seems to be the only manufacturer making half decent universal remotes  needs to go back to the drawing board  I just can t believe they tested this on humans before releasing it Aside from the ergonomics  the buttons are not particularly satisfying  the touch screen is not particularly slick  I guess we are all spoilt from using iPhones    iPads   and I found more than once having to manually power on my cable box  despite having tuned the setup carefully and there being no obstructions between the remote and the device  I like the fine tuning ability that you have with Logitech s Harmony software  but it does seem unnecessarily complex sometimes  The remote update also seems to take an unnecessarily long time I have absolutely no objection to paying 250 for a universal remote that does what it needs to do and feels good in the hand  However  this is not that remote  Not even close Logitech  if you are listening  get a new design team  You can do better than this We were replacing a Harmony One remote  discontinued  that became unreliable after a few years  but we decided to find a reconditioned one after sending this one back Buyer beware 
Horrible design of the remote 1  Power button on top of the rewind button  which results into pressing power accidentally 2  Rewinding play fast forward is on the top of the remote as a result you have to move you hand to actually press any button not ease of use 3  Again when you try to rewind play etc  you find yourself touching the touch screen  which causes other unexpected problems Easy of programing 1  Have to use special app to program 2  have to plugin remote every time you want to change anything and sync it  This day an age you should be able to program it via an app RF not embedded 1  RF should be already inside the remote for the money Battery 1  No battery warning or battery indicator 2  Battery not replaceable and very hard to replace with third party batteries  Have to open remote Interface 1  Slow to use 2  Sometimes touch screen buttons are not responding 
the backpack doesn t have enough space to hold 2 lens and a camera and a flash for a photo session 
Holds everything I needed with room to spare  Great backpack 
Works perfectly  everything is secure  It is easy to carry 
it is going to take patients  When it works it works great  I ve had the older model time to upgrade  Older one worked great still trying to get this one working all the time  It just going to take time to get it all figured out  I would recommend it if you like a small challenge  You might get it in one sitting 
I bought this speaker with great expectations  I heard a lot about of Hi res audio lately and I really wanted to see and hear what was it Boy  was I happy listening? You bet  I was  This something new that we are going to hear a lot about  This will be the new standard of audio 
Seriously They actually write the spec at 2500 watts That s beyond ludicrous  I doubt that it even puts out one hundredth of that power  Even for a real amplifier to put out a true 250 watts  it s going to cost you 300 to 400 and the unit itself will have a HUGE transformer weighing 10 to 15 lbs alone  Besides  you couldn t even plug the unit in to a standard wall plug  which only gives 1500 watts max  So  just say no to this
Great remote  It replaced an older Harmony remote and this new one is awesome  Relatively easy to sink with existing components and very easy to use 
I read some reviews and individuals had some trouble configuring the device  I followed the directions and had absolutely no problems  I wish I had purchased this item long ago since it s made such a huge difference in the simplicity of running my audio  video devices 
This control does not work well even after multiple upgrades to the software  you can click on a channel and not get the one programmed but another one   usually with 2 or 3 digits for a 4 digit channel   e g  1004 comes in 04  104  14  and eventually it will go to 1004  I do not recommend this to anyone 
Simple in everything  including the programming  Best cost  benefit 
Great price high quality  Crystal clear audio Terrific stereo sound  Perfect for iPad 
High quality sound in a compact package  The blue tooth is a handy feature 
I use this speaker as part of a multi room wireless setup for music throughout the house  The sound is very rich  and great for mids and highs  Amazing coming from such a relatively small speaker  There s an Extra Bass setting for heavy bass  but it sounds great and has plenty of bass as is so I leave that feature turned off  If turned on it s too bass heavy at higher volumes in my opinion  I have larger speakers and subs for that  I would highly recommend this speaker  even as a stand alone portable unit as it can definitely hold its own  and it can be paired to another one for double the power  It s also VERY sturdy  it s got some heft to it as its interior is of steel construction  not cheap plastic  There are all sorts of settings you can select from using the Sony app for iOS or Android  It automatically turns on when activated via Apple AirPlay  Spotify  GoogleCast  Bluetooth  when you have the standby feature turned on  and it automatically turns off after 15 minutes of not being used  But you can adjust either feature using the app  amongst other options for sound  battery  network name  auto or manual updating via WiFi  etc  etc  This is obviously not a cheap speaker  so I d never take it to the beach for example   I d buy a much cheaper speaker for that 
every event is sony camera and sony products cassettes
This little speaker has hi def sound  If you re a bass lover  this is not the speaker for you as you may think the bass is lacking  But for audiophiles  its acceptable 
This speaker completes the whole house sound completely  It is a must have
This is really a great piece of kit  It is very well built  easy enough to setup with Sony s mostly useless app  and has very flexible input options  The inputs are selectable with a capacitive button on the top of the device  or in the app   There is notably a lack of a play  pause button  but perhaps you can just use the power button  non capacitive  to the same effect  Having some on device controls would have been a nice touch The Spotify Connect and Google Cast features work without a hitch  The device appears in the list of target devices in every app I tried  DLNA works great as well from Sony s app and from other clients like Synology s DS Audio  My Synology appeared in the network tab of the app with no fuss This device successfully renders Hi Res files  because  well  they are a thing and you likely have some  However  it is not clear to me that this device is actually capable of revealing any additional clarity or details that may  or may not  be present in such encodings  But I digress    Concerning multi room  If you are interested in Google Cast groups for multi room  you will have to wait for a promised update from Google to use groups with this device  see Google Cast audio FAQs   I have not tested it with Sony s proprietary multi room protocol  but why bother The tantalizing promise of the Cast protocol is that it is essentially open and the consumer  such as myself  can build a wireless multi room system with components from different manufacturers  But not just yet    I eagerly await the grouping update from Google This device and devices like it will be the Sonos killer Read more
Remote works well with most of our gadgets  The Xbox seems to be more finicky  Nice to have one remote to start everything at once  The phone app is terrific and works really well 
These memory cards helped increase the speed of my computer  and geek squad was very helpful in attaining these and installation
I have a Surface Pro 3 which is about a year old  The one feature I was looking forward to using in Windows 10 is Hello  for signing in  This keyboard is the perfect answer  Not only do I love the fingerprint reader which allows me to use the Hello  feature  but the new keyboard layout is great and the larger trackpad is also a welcome addition  It also works really well  This was a great tweak on a great product 
I love it n the colorful light s is awesome
When I opened the package and felt the heft of this speaker  I was sure this was going to be a winner  After pairing it with my Ipod and playing the first song  the disappointment set in  The sound quality was not as clear or crisp as the Bose or UE Megablast  It may be a good party speaker with better sound at higher volumes  but it just didn t pass my sound test at normal volumes 
I ve seen faster ram for a cheaper price  My MB was able to detect the correct speed without manually changing it 
I expected alot more from these headphones because of how high the price tag was  Plus they were recommend to me by a sales person  Not worth the high price tag 
I purchased this several months ago with the intention of replacing another really worn out set  I never would of guessed how much it has become integrated into my routine  As a student  I carry many books on occasion  as would be expected of one   When I use earbuds or wired headphones  they would only get in the way  and when I wanted to make a call  take a call  cables   wires would only get in my way When I got the MEElectronics Air fi  ALL of my problems were gone  I could carry all my books  in hand and in bag  without any hassle if I wanted to listen to music  make a call  Granted  I still haven t explored all the possible functions these headphones offer  they serve me very well  The microphone is more receptive than I thought   I would imagine I would need to speak up in a crowded place but that was never the case  the caller could perfectly hear as if I were speaking through the phone s microphone  The Bluetooth is also very good   10 ft  of bluetooth was not exaggerated The only problem I really had with these is that if you wear them too long  they heat up your ears  It s great for winter  when it s uber cold  but during the summer   you can imagine what issues can crop up All in all  excellent headphones  great utility  great price 
work great  walk around the house while in use without any problems
Excellent Fidelity  great Battery life  Strong Bluetooth signal 
Haven�t used it yet just recently bought it can�t wait to use it
Unlike all the good reviews I read before purchasing this  my experience has been quite the opposite   I am very  very disappointed  I think it took about 3 or 4 hours to fully charge the battery pack when I first got it    it would then charge my Galaxy 4 phone in about 2 hours or so  but then the battery pack is done  After charging my phone fully  the battery pack drains quite fast when not in use  I started to recharge my phone tonight   although it charged at first  I noticed my phone suddenly began losing the charge  I figured that the battery pack had drained while in the drawer  so I plugged it in to charge it    after 1 hour  the battery pack still had a red light on  felt quite hot    the charger at the point where it is plugged into the wall  was so hot it alarmed me  something that had never happened when charging my phone  I immediately removed it  with the red light on the battery pack still on    decided to see if I could see just where things stood  I plugged my phone into it   saw a temporary green light  Then nothing  My phone is charging slowly but who knows what will happen next  Some are saying they ve gone on day long adventures  away from local plug in availability    had no problem losing power to their devices  I m in my own home   can only get 1 charge on 1 occasion    a burning hot charger on another occasion  This device is absolutely serving no purpose whatsoever  as I can charge my phone on the charger that it came with  If this thing won t hold it s own charge  unused  for more than a couple hours  what s the point? Totally useless in an emergency  What a waste of money  And it s too late to return it  So I m stuck with a piece of junk   am out  43  It was on sale for  40    now the sale price is down to  30  Piece of junk     maybe just a lemon  but this is very discouraging   I have to say don t bother  Also  be sure to test repeatedly  on different levels of service  from the very beginning so you can return if it isn t going to last  I ve got my eye on another one  more expensive but hopefully better quality  Just waiting for it to go on sale  Next time  I m not going to go with blind trust    I ll test it every which was but loose starting immediately    return it if it doesn t live up  This product is a dud 
We have spent several hours trying to get this remote set up  activated to no avail  Thus we cannot give an accurate review  We need help  be they Geeks or otherwise 
Do not lose signal with this system  great music channels
Everyone in my family hates this new harmony remote  We love our Harmony One up in the kids playroom but the Ultimate is the ultimate disappointment  It is not well balanced in hand  It defaults to screens we don t want on the touch screen  It requires 2 hands since it is so out of balance that touching some of the buttons feels really wonky  Do not buy one of these  A used or refurbed Harmony One would be much better  I think the guys who designed this were too in love with their Android phones and wanted to create a similar feel but it stinks  I fail to find a way to make it start on the screen we want  I ve actually had to threaten my kids with punishment if they bring up how much they hate this one 
this is a good device to have to power up your phone in case of emergency and you are close to a power outlet 
The only problem is some of the main buttons we use are at the bottom of the remote which is not as user friendly  We do like the charging stand 
I love not having all the boxes remotes  But having to charge it really often  Is a pain  And the shape of it and the way it sits is odd 
I had an earlier version of this model  Two things about it were too big of a hassle 1  It was very easy to accidentally have duplicate buttons on the screen for the same device  I think I spent more time with it plugged into the computer than I spent actually using it 2  You know how you can eventually learn where the buttons on a remote are  and you don t have to look at it? You just kind of feel for the buttons? You can t do that with this thing because the buttons on the screen keep changing position Also  while the battery is charging  you have to use the old remotes anyway 
It s been great having this for my 2nd desktop n other electronics that we have in the house
There is a learning curve with this remote  But so far  it is giving good service  The only issue I do not like is the slow response time when hitting a button to have the TV do something  But I understand the TV goes through a ton of things to get stuff done 
Not sure it was worth the money and it has frozen up a few times  Needs keyboard on face 
As advertised   Easy to use and setup on line  No problems with unit operation and quality 
Harmony Ultimate One ReviewA few weeks ago I received and then responded to an E Mail  survey from Logitech  It pays to register your products    To make a long story short although I am not a professional reviewer  they chose to give me a Harmony Ultimate One universal remote to test and review as a customer  how cool is that   Anyway  regardless of how I got my hands on this unit  I promise an honest review  so here it goes Ease of SetupWhen I received the Ultimate One  I ll refer to it as the U1 for the remainder of the review   I had already been familiar with the My Harmony website  where I had set up the U1 s predecessor the Harmony Touch  Just like that endeavor  setting up the U1 on the website was as simple as can get  You re walked through each step beginning with finding your components on their HUGE database  I had no trouble finding all my gear   then arranging your activities  e g  watch TV  listen to a CD  play a video game  etc   and finally synching everything together to make it work  The bigger and more complex your system  the longer it may take you to set up the remote  but the ease of it all remains the same  Using the website to set up the remote is a trouble free and actually pleasurable experience  SCORE  5 out of 5Ability to CustomizeThe U1 allows for some pretty cool customization  For one example  you can upload jpeg photos for icons  So  in theory  if you took a digital photo of yourself  you can use that picture as an icon to watch TV  the inner geek in me loves this stuff   Aside from that  you can change background colors  change the name of an activity  like changing watch TV to Living Room TV   adjust the touch screen brightness  etc  One cool feature is that you can adjust the brightness of the back lit hard buttons independent from the touch screen  nice   You can even choose how you want the unit to provide tactile vibration feedback when you press a touch screen button  icon  also a nice touch   On the down side  if you re into animated menus and icons  you won t find any here  SCORE 4 5 out of 5Performance  Ease of UseThe simplicity of the U1 s setup transferred to its use  Logitech seems to get everything right off the bat  After listing my gear and arranging my activities  everything works perfectly  I don t know how they do it  but the delay times  sequence of power on  input choice  etc    was perfect  If for some reason it isn t  you can always adjust as needed  For TV viewing  Logitech Harmony provides 50 favorite channels  which show up as Icons on your U1  So  if you program HBO HD into your favorites  simply press the appropriate Icon to get that channel  The best part is  the Icon s  along with the corresponding channel numbers  are selectable from Logitech s impressive database  simple as can get   Being that this is an IR remote  with good line of sight coverage   if you accidentally move away while turning your components on  or off  causing a part of your system not to respond to IR commands  simply activate the help feature  The U1 will guide you through all of your components  ensuring that each one is on and the appropriate inputs are engaged in your display device  receiver  switcher  SCORE 5 out of 5ErgonomicsMuch has been written about the transport buttons located on top of the U1 s predecessor  the Touch  They are still there on the U1  however  the fast forward and rewind buttons perform double duty  keep your finger pressed on either and you can skip  go back to the next  previous Blue Ray  DVD or CD chapter or track  I Like    The vibrate feature  when you hit a touch screen Icon  and the auto on based on motion  are HUGE improvements over the Touch  in my opinion  I don t know if Logitech meant for it to be handled this way  but concerning the aforementioned transport buttons on top of the remote    I find that it s easier to manipulate them with my forefinger than thumb  The backside of the remote has a more tactile friendly feel  like very light sandpaper   The front touch screen  surrounded by the hard buttons nestled onto the remote  is quite attractive  The non contact areas finished in piano gloss black add to the fit and finish  SCORE 4 out of 5ValueIt s hard to assign a value rating on consumer electronics  In my opinion  one must decide  Does it make my life easier Does it make my life more enjoyable If the answer to both of those questions is yes  then what s an appropriate price for such bliss At 249 99  the U1 isn t cheap however  for a home theater nut like me   its value is awesome  Would I recommend this remote for someone with just a flat panel and cable box Absolutely not  There are far less expensive options out there for that  Now  if money is absolutely no object and you asked me   I would say yes  However  I would also wonder why you don t have a more advanced  complex system  For the Home Theater enthusiast  like me      the U1 is a very good value  After spending literally thousands  over the years  on Home Theater equipment  249 99 is indeed a good value  SCORE 4 5 out of 5Plus and minusesPlus  Incredibly easy set up and use  Gesture capability with customization  Can control 15 devices  Comes with charger and one year warranty  Vibrate command option  Motion control backlight  Fifty channel favorites with appropriate Icons Minus  The infamous transport buttons located above the touch screen  Price for simple systems may not be a value  You cannot replace the rechargeable battery Final ThoughtsGet this remote  If you have components hidden away in cabinets or out of the direct line of sight for infrared  then purchase the Harmony Hub  about 100 00   I use it in my home theater and it works beautifully  However  as a standalone remote  the U1 has pretty good range for IR  as did its predecessor  the Touch   If you have more than a flat panel and a cable box  this remote should be at the top of your list  You will be able to set it up quickly and be able to use it efficiently  FINAL SCORE 4 6 out of 5
Logitech put many often used features  such as page up  page down  activities and the numeric keypad into the touch screen  Other functions such as power off  volume  channel up  down  menu and guide are illogically placed above and below the touch screen  You need to look at the touch screen to use it  This model lacks the simple ease of use of older Harmony remotes  This model in not nearly as intuitive and guest who are not used to working with it have a difficult time figuring it out with out instruction 
I had already purchased the Harmony Hub on sale the week prior when I noticed that the Harmony Ultimate One was on sale the following week  Along with Philips Hue lights and Google Home  I now have the ability to control my lighting as well as my TV  Pioneer receiver  Xbox One S  Apple TV and Tivo via voice commands or by using this remote  Only real con IMO is the price  but if you have what it takes to take advantage of the features the results are nothing less than magical 
I negotiated one of these directly from Logitech as a replacement for a Harmony One that developed the swelling battery issue and became dangerous to use  At first Logitech refused to replace  but I was persistent and it paid off My review follows I have only had this unit for a few days  but so far I like it  It s a completely different concept than their old remotes  The software is new  and you program for your area and you service provider  So far so good My first issue was  my zip code  About 4 years ago  the USPS  in it s infinite wisdom changed my zip code  Four years later  Logitech hasn t yet caught up  When I entered my zip code  nothing  Then  on a whim  I entered my old zip code  one that doesn t exist anymore  and bingo  it was recognized The programming from there was tedious but pretty easy  Te remote allows you to select up to 50 of your favorite channels  and you chose them from a touch screen using icons that identify the channel and also shows the channel number  You can also arrange these icons in any order you want  The icons are small  and some are hard to read  What this means to me is  that I no longer have to use DirectTVs Channel Guide to locate the channel number  and then enter that on a keypad on the remote  I simply scroll on the touch screen until I find the channel I want and tap  The remote has made a few mistakes  but generally it s pretty good and choosing the correct channel  It does save time  There is also the option of a numeric touch screen for those instances where you want to enter a numeric number  I don t think I will be using the numeric key pad much  Also  during the programming  there was an instance where Logitech s software hadn t picked up the complete channel lineup  but there is a provision that allowed me to manually enter it  albeit with a generic icon  So far it works for me As a final thought  as I mentioned earlier  this was a replacement for a Harmony One that had a swelled battery and had become dangerious to use because of excessive heat coming from the remote  The battery in the Harmony One is in a nacelle and once it starts to swell  it s impossible to remove  I know I tried  I also have a Harmony 880  that battery had also started to swell  but the battery is mounted in a conventional way  and it was easily changed  I guess Logitech is worried about this going forward  because the battery in the Ultimate One is NOT  that s right  is NOT replaceable  The instructions say that when the unit reached end of life Who knows when that is You dismantle  destroy  the unit and remove the battery for disposal I don t believe this is the proper solution on an electrical item that has a list price of 250 00 
I actually purchased this remote for a family member as a gift  I have one of my own and absolutely love it  For my house I am able to replace five remotes and not loose any functionality  I set the remote up for my family member and was able to replace seven remotes with one and retain all functionality  This remote is fantastic  it has its own charger so you never need batteries  The display and swipe features make it very easy to use  And if something doesn t power on initially  no worries  there is a help button that can fix anything that doesn t power on  You can program your favorite channels and instead of typing in the number and hitting enter you just tap the favorite icon on the screen  This remote  for the price  is unbeatable 
This remote is a massive step down for the Harmony line  I ve owned 5 Harmony remotes across the range and this is the worst by a long stretch  I received this remote as a courtesy replacement for my old Harmony One remote whose battery failed and leaked which I credit Logitech support for  But  that doesn t change that fact that I d kill to have my old One back instead of this  Tech manufactures need to learn that adding a touch screen just because you can and because you can call it premium is a terrible business strategy List of problems 1  Ergonomics   Bad button placement  The playback controls are bizarrely placed at the top of the remote  which in this DVR age  is a awful place for some very highly used buttons  The power button is very close and nearly indistinguishable from the rewind button which means about every other day I accidentally turn my system off  very frustrating  No hard page up  down buttons means you need to use the clunky gesture system 2  Touch Screen   This a low quality  unresponsive touch screen  These are common on devices where touchscreens are superfluous like thermostats and printers  but since it s a integral part of how you re expected to use this device it s a big problem  Swiping and tapping are touchy and laggy  Gestures are hit or miss  I understand why they wanted to add this since it allows them to combine the number pad  favorites list  activities  device controls and custom buttons into a single control but it makes using all these items  especially the number pad  a poor experience 3  Battery life   My 650 lasts 6 9 months on a set of batteries  My 880 would last for 2  months on a single charge  My One would last for 4 5 weeks on a single charge  This new Ultimate One only lasts 5 7 DAYS on a single charge  It s really dismal and my device count and usage has actually decreased in the last couple years making this extra surprising  all in all a bad trend 4  Setup Software   This has always been a problem with these remotes and it s not better with this version  The software works and you only need to live with it rarely  so it s not damning  but this really should be much better  It needs a re write from the ground up with a focus on usability and efficiency I m thinking that I may be abandoning the Harmony line in the not to distant future  It s a shame 
My Harmony remote works fantastic  Love the iPhone like features  Great that battery will not overcharge like previously purchased remotes 
Bought this as a replacement for a 650 remote and didn t care for it 
I like it so far  I don t like that you can t have a number pad and one touch favorites at the same time 
I have not used this remote too much since I purchased it  I love Harmony remotes  It takes a little bit of work to get it set up the way you want it to function  but in the end  they make it easier to watch TV or control your devices  
Harmony ruined these remotes  Taking the keypads away for a useless pathetic touch screen sucks very sluggish GUI  Just horrible 
I bought this remote for convenience   the style    I will be getting more  
GREAT product  OVERKILL for the TV and Soundbar    but this is my second Harmony and a super product 
great device works with all of the devices we have  I would recommend 
Love it  can control and switch between devices a lot easier also works with Amazon echo 
It s a pain to setup  Logitech has professionals that will do it for you for free but they are slow Once it s setup the only downfall is line of sight  Needs perfect LOS to all the devices it accesses which is a potentially huge problem if your receiver is on the left and the TV is on the right or something worse 
I read reviews on this remote  however  it was hard to use with my Sonos sound system and Samsung 65  tvVery confusing  better off with a much more simple all in one remote
I love it  Except  the extenion speaker wire is hard to fine
I was comparing this stereo to another brand in store which came with a satellite receiver included  I bought this one because I wanted the removable faceplate  and if you bought online that weekend  the satellite receiver was  20 off  Got it installed by Best Buy and they did a great job  having the Bluetooth included is awesome  It s installed in a small 2 seater car  and this unit really pumps out some power  great sound and takes just about any source of music other than CD  Fantastic price on it as well 
My first order came smashed up  the replacement they sent has 3 dead pixels out of the box  To top it all off  Samsung has enbedded a permanent advertisement in the menu bar  you can t hide it  to pump the streaming service Vudu  never used it or heard of it before this  
I first started off using Noise Cancellation headphones since I do many long trips from the US to Asia  I first started using the QC15 and then upgraded to the QC25 which I currently use  I was looking for something with the bluetooth option  which Bose does not offer Then I saw the JBL display in the store and decided to buy them and give them a try What a night and day difference from the QC25 The sound customization that is available by the app along with the ANC is a big difference coming from Bose  The sound was clean and crisp I have not been able to test the noise cancellation on an airplane yet  however in a server room it did work very well The only drawback is the weight difference between the two sets  The Bose is lighter  but at the end of the day  Im going to stick with the JBL 
Works great  Easy to set up  Only issue is that a few times it just shut off everything on its own  Seems isolated though  Battery life is good  Best to leave in charger all the time when not in use and look on YouTube on how to change battery 
I give this 5 stars because it is exactly what I wanted and as described  The speaker are the right size for my 12 x 16 man cave  The bass sounds excellent  Some quick thoughts1  it came with speaker wire and the connection for the bass   I bought a spool of 16 gauge speaker wire because I could not tell that it came with wire  The wire looks to be 18 gauge  so I m happy I got the other spool  2  the speaker mounts can be key hole or there are screw holes  I used the VideoSecu 5 Black Deluxe Speaker Mount Brackets for Walls and Ceilings 1XZ and they worked great  Note that you do have to cut a separate hole through the wall with these mounts  I tried to hide the wire as best I could Overall  very happy with the quality and price 
Our school has a few mini dv cameras and I looked everywhere for these tapes  Great quality too 
it is the best and i am happy i will recommit to my friend 
Must have I want to get a second one to pair up with it
We returned this to Amazon as we found the touchscreen to be overly sensitive and also found the remote seemed to have a mind of its own  Channels or activities would change with no one touching the remote  Maybe we have a ghost in the house but we are much happier with our old Harmony One 
it is fast and breaks bench marks but it hangs a lot worse then my older systems
Works as advertised  Would be better if there was an app that woukd tell you how much battery is left  Not as compact as equivalent battery capacity in new smart phones  Likely an older design battery installed in the casing 
Handy for carrying camera when on the move and roomy
Love  love  love the Harmony Universal Remote  Now I don t have to fiddle with the various remotes  from my television  sound bar  blue ray player  cable company  That s right   4 remotes that I would have had to deal with had I not gotten a universal remote  It makes using my entertainment system so much easier  The universal remote is quite simple to use  once you get the hang of the touch screen  What is really nice on it is the  help  function  which asks you a series of simple questions if for some reason things go awry  In other words  the device is essentially self correcting 
Flexible to remove if needed  Also good typing alternative to a standard keyboard 
The Bluetooth works great and is a must with the new laws about distracted driving 
Salesman said these would work on Ipod  Well he was wrong  They might be great headphones 
Bass had static and the cord that connects speakers to laptop did not work  Returned to store and replaced with another pair  Second pair works great 
Newer more high tech than the last one  Geek squad programmed 
Really like the way this unit  blends in  with its surroundings  coupled with the Slim TV it really is a clean looking piece 
Had a horrible time trying to setup all the remotes for my new Samsung Audio  Video System Read the reviews on the Ultimate One and decided to give it a try Boy      was I glad I did  The programming took a total of about 4 mins   and I was up and running I do agree with others that the upper button panel is a bit difficult to use when toggling back and forth The extra time it takes is nothing compared to the other benefits I would have liked to see a Favorites list for more than one user   that is the only reason I didn t give it a 5 star rating Overall            best remote out there in the price range    
The set up software was buggy  Had a hard time setting up the favorite channels  I bought a 650 for half the price that works just as well as my old Harmony One 
had to get the geek squad out to set it up and now it s too dark and we can t figure out to get it lighter
Love the whole system  The installation was explained and he was very good at what he does
Since when did people start looking green Maybe  I just have a lemon  However  no matter how much I adjust the tint people s faces look a tinge green  and it s unevenly distributed  For example  the upper right side of a face can look natural while the bottom left looks green  and vice versa  or there are patches of green around one eye  one cheek  and around the mouth and half the side of a chin  and sometimes there s half a green nose  It s just annoying The sound is ok  sometimes it sounds distorted  I wish it had surround sound I would have liked the Guide button on the remote instead of having to press the home button on the remote and then pressing the arrow button on the remote to scroll and search for the guide I like the Smart Hub s white interface  Smart Hub is fast  and I like how the apps display where I ve been  For example  when I scroll on the Netflix app it displays the movie I had watched plus movies I might be interested in  and it does it without having to go directly into the app 
I used my Bose QC20i as my primary noise cancelling headphones for a long time but became frustrated with the in ear style so I decided to pickup an over the ear set  It boiled down the offering by Bose  beats and JBL I noticed these in the Sunday ad and how they were a  Best Buy Exclusive  so I went down to a store to check it out  They have a really nice display that worked which went a long way  If you have been to stores sometimes this is not the case Before I tried them on I did a quick Google search for some details and it came up with all the of marketing splash  it is all words until you try them out in my opinion  What struck me initially trying them on is the seal around the ears  They are very comfortable on the ears and seal very well  After wearing the headset for about an hour it starts to fatigue the top of the head  Looks like they chose to make the ear the comfortable spot which is fine The audio sounds great  comparable with the beats in a good way  I am not a fan of the sound of the Bose headphones  they have that Bose sound which is like audio Doritos  always the same consistent sound but never blows you away lol  The NXTGEn Active Noise Cancelling technology is very interesting  Having come from Bose I had very high expectations and I would say that JBL has met those expectations and exceeded them in a few key ways  namely the Ambient Awareness  This feature is cool in that it allows you to hear what is going on around you to a degree based on preference  This would have been perfect for studying with my cohort back in school when you wanted to kill all of the background non sense but wanted to still be able to hear someone crack a joke or ask an interesting question on a tough problem I think one of the coolest parts of this product is the app that you can download  I did not even know about it until I Googled it and it makes all the difference  You can set your own EQ  turn On  Off the Noise Cancel and set the level of the Ambient Aware independently for each each with is great  The hearing in my left ear sucks from driving with the window down all the time so it is nice to customize to each ear I attached some pictures of the app  One of the other cool things which I still do not understand how they do it but it is called TruNote  I guess it measures your head and tunes the headphones for it  I really like this feature as I usually am wearing glasses of some kind so this really helps when they are on  I did an A  B comparison with it on and off it the music was especially clear when I used the TruNote calibration The built in mic is okay but it seems like it is too far up on the headset for it to be really legit  It works but I would say that I get better performance from the QC20i hanging dongle thingy I would recommend this to anyone looking at a 299 99 price range headset that wants great sound and utility  I cannot stress the utility enough the app really makes this headset very versatile  whether for use in the office to drone out the HVAC that always runs or for general listening in any situation 
This is a fantastic remote easy to use and does everything it is suppose to
I have been using the MS Surface Pro since the first version  I have always loved the snap on keyboard  This new keyboard from Microsoft is superior in many ways to the original Surface and Surface Pro keyboards  The actual buttons are slightly larger and spread a litter further apart  This allows for a premium typing experience  I find that it rates better than even some laptops I have worked with  The addition of a fingerprint reader is a great new feature  Being able to take advantage of Windows Hello is very cool  Its a small pleasure but when I touch my Keyboard and my Surface gives me a personal hello  it makes my day 
I am in absolute awe of this speaker  Wouldn t trade it for anything  better than Bose in my opinion 
adding the additional memory to my server increased performance significantly  I a very happy with the purchase 
Super fast  just seems a little too bulky  If your not using the cradle and plugging straight into the side of your laptop it puts stress on your USB ports as well as covers an addition usb slot you could be using 
It worked great right out of thr box  I like the feature that allows you to choose between a blaring alarm or a video alert  My old one was very annoying when the alert went off 
A bit pricey  but overall great headphones  Last me about 16 hours of listening  Theu turn off after 15 mins of non use 
These JBL sound better than the Beats Studio Wireless pair i also purchased  The comfort of the ear cup  and the functionality brought by the app make this a must have pair for me 
Even though i read reviews and I knew this before buying let me tell you like this  This is an am  fm radio without your iPhone  No Bluetooth  but at least I m charging my phone while connected  The volume is a touch screen button  I miss the knob  but hopefully you have steering wheel volume controls  It works great as a touch screen button with hardly any hesitation  but the touch area is small and maybe frustrating when looking for it while driving  The functionality itself works just as good as an iPhone  Simply perfect 
great  but the touch screen is not very sensitive and u have to slap it and try to get it to go to other screens over and over again  But it is very reliable 
Great item  I m very satisfied with it must have  
This Sony stereo was better than i expected  i was surprised how loud it was  with a crisp clear sound  I m ready to throw a party now lol
Awesome radio with so many cool features  Works very great 
Awesome sound awesome bass very good quality for the price  Better than expected
Awesome                                              
First off  it s Bluetooth headphone or bust for me  This one definitely met that requirement and more  Perfect audio quality and comfortable earpads make this pair of headphones a sure buy 
If your computer will accept it  this is great  very fast RAM  Performance is fantastic  Highly recommended 
Love it  so now I can watch all of my live out of town sports teams when I m on trips and all i need is an internet connection  It was easy to set up  just follow the instructions  The free smart phone app isn t best  but it gets the job done vs ponying up for the  15 they want 
The Bose speakers are great  They work great and sound great  If you want a plug and play system  this is it 
This keyboard is responsive and well made  The keys are the right size  shape  and depress depth for large hands and fingers of moderately high dexterity  The backlit keyboard is a great feature in poorly lit or dark areas 
This memory is great  Used it on my mac and added much more room to work on my Photoshop
Very quick and quiet machine  Great value for the money 
We live in a very rural area and use this as our primary source of internet  Works great 
Works great  My son doesn�t complain about the internet speed anymore 
We needed a powerful PC for our company and this turned out to be a great purchase  We use it with CAD software  GIS and Google Earth primarily and it has the power to do all of it  Very satisfied 
I had a choice of this portable IHome speaker or some other brands but liked this one s look  size and price after comparing various portable wireless speakers at Best Buy  When I used it at home I was really happy with the sound and its portability  Recently I even took it with me camping and listened to music  it was great 
I use this portable speaker to connect to my IPod for teaching my R I P P E D  class and it does the job 
Speaker works great  the strobe lights give it a cool feature  The base quality is superb 
Amazing performance  use it in an apartment complex and helps with connection better than others
Great stereo sound in wireless  plugged headphones 
I got this mouse in hopes of getting away from my Razer Deathadder as well as just getting rid of the mouse cable  This mouse for the time I had it was truly a great wireless gaming mouse  If you are looking for wireless this is an amazing option  The only reason I do not have it anymore is because I primarily wanted to gain more programmable buttons on my mouse with my upgrade so I went and got the G502  Despite that though I have nothing but positive words towards this mouse  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless mouse hands down 
Got it on sale and i am very pleased with it so far 
Very nice wireless headphones  Very comfortable and light on the head  Great price 
My first wireless headphones  Have been an owner of JBL speakers since the 1970 s and have always been completely satisfied 
Perfect headphones and even better for running  exercising 
These are great stylish headphones with a high quality sound cancellation and a strong Bluetooth connection 
This set of headphones is beautiful  I love the black with red  While the red may be slightly faded looking they are great  The battery last long  but there is not meter for measuring  This product works great with my Mac and iPhone for listening to music or using Siri 
I have hearing loss in both ears  so i can t judge the sound quality  But these headphones are comfortable and easy to set up  What I really like about them is the fact that it comes with a cord  so if your out of charge on it you can switch over to the cord and still listen to music 
These headphones are great  I love them because the noise cancelling is pretty good  You can t really beat that  Sound quality is great plus they have it where there s an app you download to change the equalizer  People don t notice a difference when you make calls off of them  Battery life is pretty great as well 
I ve had this for about a month  and it fits in the hand quite nicely similarly to the Razer Deatheradder  but smaller  The extra mouse buttons doesn t get in the way of gaming or practical use and the mouse wheel is okay  Great RGB lighting as well from Logitech 
Working as advertised   Setup was a snap  I recommend it 
Works great you just have to have USB 3 0 to use it 
Easy to set up  Long life on the battery  It can be used while charging with minimal downtime 
Simple  Large  full color display makes it so easy to use and navigate 
Best speed  Easy setup  WiFi for computer where I cannot have a cat cable 
We need an extension to help with the WiFi and this was it  Easy to install and works great 
Great balance of deep lows and crisp highs for a door speaker 
Set up is a breeze and the picture quality depends on your Internet or cell phone signal  Only issue we ve had so far is the commercials on the app  Other than that this does this trick to view your cable on the go 
This is my second Sling Box and I could not be happier with it  I would recommend setting it up with a hard line if possible  It definitely helps the streaming experience 
This adapter was great at first  but it drops the wi fi signal frequently  for no apparent reason  When it s working It s fast  but again  that s WHEN it s working 
I bought this weather radio for a Christmas gift and it is easy to program and now we always know when it will be bad weather 
This little radio is absolutely perfect for being alerted of the latest conditions and warnings 
this weather is better than I expected it to be  with the crazy changes in the weather today  I  me glad that I have one
this weather radio is worth every penny I paid for it  after getting it home and setting it up  there was a severe weather bulletin for our area and a possible tornado in a county north of where we live  I even recommended one to my mother  if you value your family buy one of these  even if the power goes out  you have a battery backup 
The M2 Slingbox is a great way to watch tv while traveling  Hotels often have a very limited number of channels  but with the Slingbox you can access your home television and movies on the Direct TV DVR so long as you have a good wifi signal and a laptop or IPad  
Set up the Slingbox in NYC and now we can watch all the NYC channels in another home in Canada without the expense of having to pay for cable in Canada  The instructions are not so self explanatory but once we got it up and running  worked out great  Just upload the  slingplayer  app to your phone or computer  connect to your slingbox and watch TV on your phone or computer  You can also put a streaming device  like Roku  on your TV and watch LIVE TV ANYWHERE 
This is a great product for anyone who is away from home and wants to watch local tv or sports teams  The setup was quick  easy  and straightforward  While it does use a lot of bandwidth  causing the product to disconnect on rare occasions  it is able to stream my shows at a high resolution onto an old I pad without much disruption  Streaming through an Apple TV  however  tends to be slow and the picture will freeze quite often  I would recommend using a device that has the sling box software native to the device  like a roku  to stream onto a tv 
Easy setup and app on my iPhone  Also connects thru Roku
I m surprised and how easy it was to set up this remote  Get one you will love it 
I have a TIVO Roamio OTA  Initially I was going to subscribe to TIVO Online  I was surprised to find out since I am not a cable subscriber  I couldn t access some of my taped shows without going through an online access with certain stations  Kind of a joke since I have this access at home with TIVO  The SlingBox M2 allows me to access all of my content without any nonsense from the big 3 content providers  Great Product 
This product blows me away with how well it manages multiple devices simultaneously  Even my non technical husband likes it  We were able to replace 5 remotes with this single controller and it operates everything really well  Especially nice is its ability to learn functions from other remotes that you can assign to the empty function buttons  Just remember to pop it into its charger once or twice a week 
I bought this as a gift for my mom  Now  instead of using 3 remote controls for her home entertainment system she just needs the one  The MyHarmony software made it simple to program the remote for her equipment  And setting up her favorite channels was a breeze 
This was a very good purchase  I now can watch sporting events without having to go home  Very little buffering even in starbucks on their wifi 
Great mount  Was easy to hang on the wall  Although I did need some help with the tv being that it s 60  
this is great  it solved my problem  the only thing is that after you moved it  it you have to straight is up yourself or else it will moved  
it comes in 3 packs so you don t have to worry about running out of tapes when you are right in the moment  Great video outcome  crisp and clear 
Use it as direct speaker from tv or 2 as surround with sony sound bar  Great sound 
Easy initial setup  great sound and easy to use  Portable anywhere  Great to use with Pandora  Spotify  etc  Remember to take it with you on vacation 
Great headphones  deep  beautiful sound  Only issue is that they won t go around your neck loosely  the are a little tight 
I work long hours and work from home  I m on the phone for hours a day  I need something I switch between my iPhone and my desk phone  It needed to be comfortable and have a good quality mic so I can be heard on conference calls  The sound quality is excellent and exactly what I need for calls and music sounds great through  I can answer calls on my iPhone  listen to music on my Mac  and pick up calls from my desk phone I haven t tested the range but so far  I am very pleased 
Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them  Great price for wireless headphones  Good sound too 
My 14 year old loves these wireless headphones  Great quality for the    
Very impressed at quality of picture on this Samsung large TV 
The sound quality is top notch  especially for a speaker this inexpensive  I am really happy with the improvement over the factory speakers I did my own install using Alpine s hardware  and it was a tiny bit painful using the clips they provide  If I did it again  I d just use or make some brackets 
Great sound quality at a very reasonable price  One reason that I chose these speakers was because they offer multiple mounting configurations without using some kind of adapter  My Mazda Miata has a 3 hole mounting system instead of the traditional 4 hole variation  With my Pioneer stereo  these speakers can run at full power without distortion  The bass response is surprisingly good for such modestly sized speakers  I would recommend without hesitation 
My son needed some extra RAM for the computer he was building  we looked all over for RAM and everything was  150  200 price range  We saw this at our local Best Buy and couldn t believe the low price  My son read reviews online and people were generally happy with the performance  so we bought it  So far so good  works great and he can play all his video games with no problems
They are light  attractive and the sound quality is excellent  For the price you cannot beat them  Just wish the ear pieces were like the more expensive noise cancelling phones  But I supporse that s the difference between  70 headphones and  200 ones 
Great speakers and phenomenal sound  They have a magnetic plate  very practical 
This speaker has great sound and works well to listen to just about anything  Music  movie  audios  It is great 
Easy to operate  sounds very good for size  and battery life is 6   hours and can be hooked direct to laptop to charge and  or for audio feed 
After owning two sets of Logitec surround sound 5 1 speakers for my computer  and having both of them stop working after barely over a year of use  I decided to go with Yamaha  a brand with a long established reputation for building good quality speakers and audio products  The speakers sound noticeably better than my last set  have really good specs for frequency response and distortion levels  comes with a huge subwoofer  and can handle enough watts to meet my expectations for the need to listen music at least as loud as concert volume  I have not watched movies using surround sound yet  but I paired the speakers with a new Sony amp STR DH540  also  129  and plugged in a new Chromecast  and now once again I can play music from my computer  only this time it sounds even better and I m expecting it to last and use it for home theater as well 
Speaker works great  has loud sound and is fairly versatile  Great price for product 
A very good purchase  The sound is just excellent My housemates can t get enough of it 
I was looking for a bluetooth headset to watch movies  TV shows on my tablet  For the price  these headphones are a great product for a bluetooth headset with mic  They paired up easily with my Asus Tablet and also my GNEX Phone  They are very comfortable and the sound quality is better than I expected  Great Support   I emailed MEElectronics about a question and received a response within 24 hours 
Product seems to work flawlessly  I have been able to watch my bedroom tv almost anywhere  So far the only the only drawback has been slow or overloaded networks  such as Starbucks or Coffee Bean  It was very easy to setup   on line video  
Everything works as expected  Set up is very easy 
Good build quality  sound  considering the price  Happy with purchase
Great value for a basic LCD  Great picture for non 4K 
I purchased these speakers to play music from my iPhone wirelessly  and I have not been disappointed  Easy to set up with great sound  My only complaint is the flashing LED lights when there is no input    you need to flip the switch on the side to turn it off completely 
small compact size deck   its depth is shorter that normal deck due to it only being a receiver   it was also the least expensive deck available with bluetooth 
Bought this to replace a JBL Charge that finally gave out after 3 years  Technology has moved the goalposts to where this one has twice the battery life  way deeper bass response  and a speaker phone feature and cool led lights which the JBL did not have for the same price  Solid build and excellent sound 
Easy to set up  great natural looking color even when using indoor antenna
Good sound  Easy to use and pleased with product  
Great price for a complete set of 5 1 speakers  Great sound  there will of course always be something better than this  but nothing comparable to this price 
I have been traveling and this little gem has been very handy for the grandkids to stream videos 
Nice radio with great features
These headphones have clear crisp sound  Best value in this price range
This is a great price for multi pack of tapes for your camcorder 
We weren t trying to spend a whole lot of money so went with a brand we trust JVC  Way better stereo than what we thought it would be  Love it   
Works great with my Mid 2010 MBP 13�  If you are looking to speed up your old mac this is the right products 
Amazing the amount of stuff that fits in this bag  The overall construction of the bag is tip notch as well 
wonderful pair of headphones that are built solid with something i can respect    a metal stripe going down both earphones to prevent the classic plastic snap problem that the competitors have  battery life is great and the sidebuttons seem solid and longlasting  Feelin  like a vocaloid
Had old Harmony One and this is a replacement  Harmony has come a long way  Great  Many new features which makes this a great buy 
I have a mid 2009 15  MacBook Pro with 4 GB of RAM  I noticed that I was routinely running with less than 1 GB free  and noticed paging when I started a virtual machine or loaded a large program like iPhoto or Lightroom  Since the upgrade my virtual machines and the larger programs start faster  The performance increase was not as noticeable as moving to an SSD drive  but the RAM upgrade was less than 25% of the cost of a new SSD

Needed to replace a Harmony 650 that I d wore out the buttons on from use  After upgrading to a new TV  decided to upgrade to a more advanced remote  and Harmony was best option  Was able to get this remote for a little over 100 and so far its proven well worth it  Imported my 650 config into my new remote and in 5 minutes it was working great  Only tweeked a few settings so far and easy via newer software interface  Overall ver pleased with this remotes performance 
feels much better than previous models  love the addition of the fingerprint id really wish it came in more than just the color black though  Color is a big part of my life and style and the black  grey feels extremely bland  Thats just personal preference though 
Got these on sale after I blew the stock speakers in my truck and they work great 
Having the spaced out keys and glass track pad have been very welcome changes to the Pro Keyboard
This is a touch screen remote  With instruction from the Geek Squad team we are enjoying the upgrade  They programmed for us  We find it easy to use 
I have been thinking about buying a universal remote for a long time but just didnt know where the technology was  I got this remote on a great deal and it has been amazing 
Set up was relatively easy  the overall interface is intuitive  It doesn�t consistently follow the activity as programmed  but it�s pretty easy to get things back on track  Overall a good purchase

Easy set up  easy to use  and pretty durable for a universal remote  The touchscreen function works fairly well but the best part again was the set up  It was extremely easy as long as you know all of the model numbers for all of your devices  I highly recommend this product
Love this remote  Went back and forth between this one and a couple other Harmony remotes  I definitely choose the right one  You won t be disappointed 
Provided software recognised all of our devices right off the bat  Remote and software is slow and rather laggy    Interface awkward and needs work  Otherwise it works rather well 
Remote controls all of my components  Love the touch screen
Supper easy to setup and use  Highly recommend if you do not need RF control or want to control with wifi or phone 
Works as advertised  stays charged with convenient base  Setup is straight forward and easy  however  my Insignia TV model wasn t properly programmed in the remote   incorrect number of inputs  and thus I alway have to update the input selection 
Bought this to replace a broken  older Harmony One  Love the new features  set up took a few minutes and was absolutely painless with translation from Logitech site  Really happy with the new remote 
Consilidated 5 remotes into one and we live it  So much easier 
Purchased to replace an outdated Harmony  It controls all of my A  V equipment and set up was easy  I love the touch screen feature and the ability to recharge the unit 
Very great universal remote  But however  it is a little on the expensive side for a remote    249 99 I have to say I would ve never have just purchased this  Then only reason why I got it was because it was free with the purchase of my  1800 dollar projector I bought  But I am very stunned at how good this remote is  I would 100% recommend this remote if you re willing to pay the price  I have to say it is worth the two hundred and fifty dollars 
Great unit so far  For most bay boat set ups running your speakers off the built in amp out to 4 coaxials and a separate mono amp for a sub in the console should be all you need to thump hard  Unless you want to go uber crazy then use all external amps  Love the wireless remote 
I bought the JVC KDX320BTS receiver for my daughter who drives a 2003 Ford Explorer  She loves it  The reception is clear and the blue tooth connection is fast and reliable  I was lucky to find it on sale  and with my reward points  I was able to get it for less than  50  I highly recommend this unit for someone looking for an inexpensive and reliable way to upgrade their existing  basic  factory stereo  The only drawback I ve found is that it does not come with a CD player  I didn t need one so it was not that big of a deal to me 
This unit works great and looks great  It provides great features for the cost
unit is simply amazing but will NOT work with PS3 unless you buy a hub with it 
Smaller unit that fits perfectly on a limited counter top 
A lot more than what I was looking for drive a truck and added this into my slip seat box with a pair of Sony explode speakers works great with pandora 
Great unit for the price  Easy to use  and the sound quality is great 
Great unit  easier to program and use than the older units
this system is easy to connect to regardless of device OS  although there is no app for windows phone  sound is full and there are a number of configurable options range is also very good 
This works great for typing  and it makes it so easy to sign into Windows with the fingerprint sensor 
I like this Type Cover with additional fingerprint ID function 
I have a Surface Pro 3 that I use for work and a Surface Pro 4 for personal  The SP4 type cover is a lot nicer than the 3 is  The key spacing feels better  I like the added finger print sensor for easier sign in 
I recently had lost 2 TV s because of weather conditions in Rochester  I just moved to a new area in Rochester   wanted to purchase 2 new TV s and they are working out well so far  Thank you for your assistance 
The TV was a gift for my boyfriend s mother  We noticed that she squinted when trying to watch her favorite Western shows  When he carried this TV in for her  she was so excited  It is so simple for her to use 
Great TV  Great Price  Purchase this same TV twice  For my bedroom and for grandson away at college  Love it 
Great television  good sound  good graphics and great resolution 
I purchased this TV for my mother for Christmas  So glad I did  It has a great picture and looks nice in her cabinet  She loves it 
Right out of the box the instructions for set up were easy to follow and they took no time to complete 
Great TV  as long as you use either tv speaker  or hook your sound bar up thru HDMI connection because the optical connection does cut in and out  I contacted Samsung twice about problem and they just want to blame the problem on everything but what it is  Other then that it s a great tv 
This is a Great TV  I love Samsung  Great color and crispness etc  Only issue is WI FI randomly loses connection   have to manually reconnect
This product had great reviews and for the price  this is a great choice 
Purchased this tv to replace an older non smart in the bed area of the master  This exceeds the Samsung on the office side  It has great picture and sound with updated apps  Love the purchase 
bought this tv for my mother for christmas  great picture good sound  would recommend this tv as a gift or a second tv 
Lots of nice feature  recommend using their online tool for awesome placement on wall
Each side moves in  out  so easy to get to connections  folds flat to wall and almost invisible  Well thought out 
Easy to install but can be a bit heavy  Very easy to mount the TV on the mount and pretty much allows the TV to be moved in any direction once its on the mount 
Very sturdy mount that will accomodate all the larger TV s on the market 
I like the Samsung tv I purchased  It has a lot of great features  which I am still learning  and I will now be able to watch Internet programs  David my sales person was very knowledgeable and I got a price match on the tv 
Get price for a smart tv so i avoided buying a roku stick 
Great picture  very versatile Can t believe how great my blue ray looks 
I bought a smart tv which is great for using the smart view from my phone 
This is my second Samsung  The first is 6 years old and still working great  I went smart tv and not 4k to keep it simple  Setup was very easy and picture quality is great  I would definitely recommend 
This is one of the better TV manufactures on the market  Highly recommended

Works great for Xbox gaming  Racing  Diablo  farming  All good 
Was the perfect tv for my satisfaction  I never had done this review in my entire life but I decided to search before i buy it  To my surprise whatever decision I made was the best one and when I got to bestbuy I ask ask the sales person what he would think about five tv s I pointed that he will choose  He chose the three that I had my mind on it 
Excellent TV   easy to setup and adjust parameters if needed Great color and volumeFantastic CC ing for those who need it
Easy to program to my devices  It is comfortable in hand and does all functions I wanted 
We have several Samaung TV s and they preform excellently and others have had long service life
We are loving our new TV and speaker  So glad that the Geek squad wsa able to come to help us set things up 
The TV is awesome for the price and includes the full Samsung online app library with online account   Great for gaming or as a monitor for a high def gaming PC  Also  the TV comes in Soap Opera mode by default and makes moves not look so great  Once the TV is set to move or theater mode the experience is awesome 
Great Tv better than expected really clear and easy for the children to work  
Grandson wanted a tv for Christmas   This was a perfect tv for him   And a good price  
Great price for a good TV if you don t need a 4K TV  
Great Tv for the price  Easy to set up to the WiFi 
Great TV  it is clear  easy to use  One problem I noticed is some of the apps will stop working for a few days or a week which is concerning because I recently bought the tv on cyber Monday  But overall fantastic and functions extremely well 
This TV performs very well  The picture quality is excellent and the ease of operation is good  I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good 2nd set 
Great picture and was perfect for using in our bedroom
Great picture quality  Reasonable price  Bought it for my kids room 
Great TV for the price   excellent picture quality and very easy to work
I read reviews before making any purchase  so I know how important it is  This is my second Samsung TV  This one is for the bedroom  The picture  sound and color is amazingly lifelike  If needed  I would purchase it again 
I m a Samsung addict  The clarity is amazing  Sharp picture
It was easy to set up when i got the tv home i also love the quality
Needed a replacement tv for one of the rooms in my house and the Samsung 40  was a perfect choice  Great picture  easy to set up and use  Been thinking about replacing another one in the house with another Samsung 40  
Nice standard size TV  Good picture quality  Setup was simple 
Picture is great and it all that we expected  TV was super easy to set up 
Purchased this for my kids to use in their bedroom  Great picture quality  smart features are super easy to use 
Samsung is always the best choice  We have 6 TV�s  This purchase was a gift  I know Nothing will go wrong  Thanks Samsung for a great product
Samsung tv s are the only tv s I have in my house and RV

Wonderful color great picture easy hook up who recommend this to my friends great price

Works great very please excellant color and sound great service at store
The Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi Fi  Blutehooth Speaker is possibly all you need for a night at the pool  a session in the personal gym  That would be me   even a Barbecue in the back yard or the patio  It has everything you need to carry your personal soundtrack any and everywhere  allowed   It s got a nice premium feel to it  it s wireless and water resistant  Plus  for the smart home savvy  there s Amazon Alexa integrated into the speaker  Okay  you ve gotta admit  that s cool   right? The sound is crisp and clear  even at high volumes  It sounds really nice  Really nice  I guess the only thing I can say I wish this thing had  would be support for other streaming services  I use a different service other than Amazon music Unlimited usually  Then there s the whole pause when the phone rings    I ll live with that  since I d normally have to scramble to find a remote on other occasions   There are few options to stream  but I would just like more   obviously  wouldn t we all?   There are still a few things I have yet to learn  but it is definitely getting the job done  You should get one or two  Really  The Ultimate Ears Power up   sold separately  is also a great accessory to go with it  as it allows you to charge your speaker without laying it on it s side  all the while   keeping the party going  I have already recommended this speaker to a couple friends   I don t waste time when I like stuff   They come in few different colors  I got the black  It goes with everything  The price is really great for such a sweet piece of tech  Christmas is coming and I don t see why this wouldn t make it s way under a few trees  If not  just get one to blast that holiday spirit throughout the house  Basically  this would be a great addition to a smart home enthusiast or someone starting up their smart catalog  Even just for that person that likes cool gadgets 
I needed a space efficient  travel charger and this is perfect 
This speaker sounds great and has decent battery life  Perfect for picnics or the beach  The adjustable lights set a beautiful ambiance for evening 
It s so nice to have all my devices controlled by one remote
Allows you to view your home satellite TV programs remotely on your laptop or phone  The interface is a bit clunky  and many times multiple tries are needed to connect  However there are few disconnections  and the picture quality is very good 
Great tool  It s an upgrade from privious logitech from 10 years age  You should download the manual for clarity of instructions
Enjoy the easy use of this remote and how it make things simpler
THANKS TO SCTT M KREUTZ  5195 WITH THE GEEK SQUAD 4 TELL ME ABOUT THIS GREAT DIVES   HELP ME WITH IT AND MORE TO GET ME SAT UP  RUNNING THE RIGHT WAY 
This item was recommended by an audiologist instead of hearing aid
The controller was easy to load and use  However it has caused a bit of a problem operating a component not keyed in 
Works very well when you turn up the volume but if you want to listen to it on a lower volume  the sound is not quite as good  Then it tends to sound muffled  Even with the extra bass turned off 
Looking for a television to upgrade my 32 inch in bedroom    All I purchase is Samsung products    This television was on sale at Sam s Club for  199 and Best Buy did a price match    Very good quality and easy to install    Truly recommend   
Samsung 40 inches tv has a crystal clear picture and very easy setup for game console 
I love the HD quality of the picture on this smart tv
I love these tapes  They always do a great recording job  And they last  I had to go back to on 3 years later and it worked just fine in the player  I have bought many of these 
I always use this brand very quality              
Used these on the family vacation  Great quality   
Good quality and great reproduction of video wit a good value 
I am a long time android user  This is my third tablet  I had the galaxy note 3 pro and was very happy  Unfortunately  it was stolen  This tablet s is the current equivalent  The screen is incredible  Very crisp and bright  Speed is great with the dual quad core processors  Battery life is better than my old tablet and this one is lighter  In my opinion  this tablet is the equal of the iPad without the lock to apple  If you want a high quality  high performance device and are willing to pay the price  this is one to get 
Love the picture  easy to install  great price just the right size
Looked all over and nothing worth my needs  I wanted something loud enough to wake up my neighbors  This system was it as soon as I saw it  and read the reviews of course 
Extremely good system for the price  At high volumes it starts to rattle and loses sound quality 
I was looking around to get a decent sound system for a good price  and at first I was skeptical of this but it has turned out to be pretty good 
I love this stereo system  it s very convenient  Love the Led light options too 
I love this radio  It s easy to use and the features are great 
It has great sound even when at full volume  Not as loud as I was hoping for tho 
Best app system ever just wish I could add more apps 
Everybody that says this system sucks is freaking wrong they must be deaf  This sterio blows my mind
It was time to replace my old system and I came across this one  It is an amazing investment  The bass is powerful and the system is loud 
Loved the apple interface device for my car  Makes listening to music and getting calls   hands free easy and convenient
Sound is great  Easy to use  easy setup remote works from far away
This system sounds amazing and has definitely exceeded my expectations I would recommend this too anyone who is looking for a home theater on a budget
I cannot be more happy with my purchase Easy to install and to connect everything Thanks best buy
Sounds amazingGreat addition to my husbands mancave just in time for the super bowl
This is our first surround sound experience and the sound is awesome  Crisp clear sound  action effects around the room  I like that you don t have to buy any other cords or speaker wire  everything comes with it Great buy 
It sounds good  especially for the price   The sub hits hard i would recommend honestly  Very easy to set up also thanks BOYTONE 
loved the surround sound my husband got me for my birthday
I bought this surge protector to replace an existing Belkin mobile surge protector  I like this surge protector that is provides surge protection and also using to charge a device via USB cable  So  it was worth the buy since I have so many electronics to charge 
I feel confident that the 55 inch TV is secure and safe  Allows viewing from lots of angles  Very pleased 
Used to mount 65  TV  Can easily adjust the viewing angle 
I use these head phones everyday for work and they re very comfortable  sturdy  and the sound quality is great  I can blast my music with out disturbing others and best of all there are no wires to get tangled up with  I can also receive and make calls like a regular blue tooth 
Excellent functionality   fully cable with little or no performance issues as long as you have high speed internet at both end of transmission
We had an older sling box and worked ok but this wireless model works great 
Mounted this in my overhead T Top box  make sure you install a quality antenna  stong sound  easy mounting  and so far no issues  
this stereo has clear audio for voive  however for spending  500 it lacks on bass went through all the settings and it has no fixture  It states to have 1800watts but dont feel like it 
I purchased this for my 16 year old son for his room and he is very pleased with it  The sound is great  it has 1800 watts and he loves being able to use the Bluetooth to play his music off of his Iphone  It offers very clear sound at all volume levels  The added feature of the colored lights is very cool  He uses it all of the time  I am very happy I spent more than I planned on a stereo for him to get the quality and features we got with this system 
I was in the market for a new home stereo system  I had purchased the LG CM 4550 a few days prior  That was a mistake  You really do get what you pay for  That was a very weak stereo with nearly non existent bass  I had returned the LG and purchased this Sony a few days later and I have not had a complaint since  The sound is very clear while the bass can be felt throughout the house  This Sony is definitely the way to go 
Sound great it is loud Subwoofer need more power besides that everything works great
Great Stereo only missing Bluetooth interface to play with any celphone
Purchased for a gift  My husband loved it  Speakers sound great 
This double din was a great buy and cheap defently would buy this again great bang your your buck love the apple feature
This stereo sounds and looks great  Everyone wants to know where we got it 
Been using this product for about 5 months now and I definitely paid a fair price for it  Obviously gave up having a CD player which is fine since I m connected thru Bluetooth  which works GREAT by the way  No LED changing but this is your basic in dash stereo so no complaints 
I purchased this a couple of months ago  has the features I wanted and the CarPlay works well with my I phone 
Like all the features  The use of blue tooth makes connecting your iPhone very easy 
After looking at stereos for about 2 months I finally decided on this one  My 11 year old loves music and as reward for getting straight A s from 3rd to 5th grade I knew a stereo would be perfect  This was the perfect price range for what I wanted  The speakers are very clear and loud  She can hook her ipad up to it by Bluetooth and stream music or movies to the stereo  I was quite surprised at how loud if actually goes while still being clear and no static in the background  There are different color lights that the speakers illuminate and you can either change the colors or turn them off all together  Has a CD player and mic input as well  She loves karaoke and she can sing to it and record it to my laptop  Overall  this was a great buy and worth much more than what you pay    
Bluetooth works just good and also comes with a Mic hadn t used the usb insertion but other then that great head unit
Bought this to put in our daughters car  she needed to have bluetooth  and an auxiliary input  There is no CD player  but this day in age  figured a teenager really wasn t going to be carrying CD s around with her 
Great and clear sound  Easy to read instructions  Worth the money 
I love my stereo  I have had family and friends ask me where I got my stereo and I told them u gotta go to Best Buy  I am very happy with my purchase  Thank u Best Buy  
I purchased the stereo because I was looking for an upgrade from my old one this one has plenty of power I can do a lot more things on this one that my old couldn t just do 
love this alpine unit  It really beats buying a stock gps  not to mention that it looks better thin stock 
Sounds really good Would highly recommend
I purchased this for my mother in law and she loves it 
The dongle that came with my gaming computer wasn t windows 10 compatable so I bought this one  It s great at keeping up during gaming but it occasionally disconnects for no reason  Still trying to figure this one out 
Had really good speed  didnt have interruptions at all 
   power supply is a little low for an XPS with a 7th gen i7  All the specs are great  and video card is more that adequate  but if the XPS series is  built  to allow for upgrades  why not just use a larger PS to begin with? Could use an extra HDMI port also  it only has 1   but there aren t many machines in this price range  i e   what I paid for it  that do  My current XPS lasted 6 years before starting to slow down  I hope I get similar longevity from this one  We ll see   
Pretty basic desktop tower with great specs  Got it for a great deal and then bought a Samsung pro ssd to replace the hdd that it comes with
Works well  Very happy  Geek squad installed them  Did a great job 
Greatest customer service  Good sale going on  Love the sound
Great car speakers  No distortion at any sound levels 
Great speakers and sound    also easy to hook up    
Replaced my rear speakers in my 350z Nizmo  What a dramatic difference  Great base and response   Great value  Would definitely recommend 
These are very good speakers with very clear sounds 
Overall great buy  There are cheaper speakers but hard to find same sound quality 
Bestbuy price matched the competition   gave me a great deal  I originally wanted something that wasn t going to break the bank and thats what I got what these  These speakers sound great in my wife s 2004 envoy xuv  Once aging Alpine hasn t let me down 
Blew a speaker in my Ford Escape  I found these jbl speakers had the fullest sound and are affordable  Easy install  15 20 min a speaker  I also purchased the plug adapter for ford from best buy  Huge improvement from stock speakers  Clear  loud  and way more bass
Bought these to replace stock speakers in my 06 silverado crew cab  The sound was incredible for the price  If you are looking for clear crisp sound at a reasonable price they are perfect  Remember these are 6 1  2   speakers so if you are wanting bass you will have to get a sub woofer
The speakers were rather easy to install provided you have the right tools  They look great  and they sound great I use them for multi room stereo  Installed them in living room as speaker B  and mostly use for low volume ambient music  but they can also go higher in volume and sound great 
These speakers are very easy to install and took less than an hour  The sound is incredible  They are a good value for the price 
These speakers worked well for my application  and sound great  I will continue to use Alpine products in the future 
Yamaha speakers provide balanced sound  Really happy with the sound quality for the price 
Had these installed in my 2004 convertible Mustang and they sound freaking awesome  These are louder and more clearer than the other brands in my other Mustangs  Geek Squad guys recommended these and they were right on the money  Thanks guys 
Sound is great  Great sound  Would recommend this to anyone 
Got these speakers for our back deck when we have company or just for rocking out at the house  These speakers do rock  They have great bass and sound  Would go well in any outdoor setting 
Nice speakers  Were open box so they didnt have the grills 
Alpine has always been my choice for great car audio These speakers sound great   I m Jammin Now   And I didn t break the budget 
I easily installed these speakers along with a yamaha receiver  My brother has Klipsch speakers and we both can not tell a difference between the two systems and the Yamaha speakers are much less 
These replaced my factory speakers on a 2010 Mazda 3 and the sound is great  No distortion and not a lot of bass  however the quality of sound is very nice 
This is one great speaker system for the price  I was totally surprised at the great quality of this system for the price  it blew us away and I have spent a great deal more for speakers and never received this quality for this price  et al
Great sounding speakers easy set up and installation
I bought this for a birthday gift and they loved it
I like it  It was better than cats  I m going to listen again and again
I own 2 of these  turns out that these can be added on to the SONY soundbars and work as rear surround speakers  The sound quality is amazing  They are really well built and feel really solid  I do have one complaint about the song pal app  its not as good as some of the other  networked audio  apps out there  I hope it will get better with time 
The sound is great with lots of volume  The battery life could be longer 
These speakers are great but I bought them for work and they won t connect to my work laptop unless I have the chord connected 
They sound wonderful  A great price for a well made speaker
This is a great product  Easy to install  Awesome sound 
Amazing sound quality  Definitely worth the price 
Bought these on the recommendation of the staff at Best Buy and couldn t be more pleased  Great sound and range  They are well built and seem to hold up to the elements  I painted mine according to the included instructions and they look great  Really brought life to my pool area now that we have music  Paired these with the Sonos amp and now all my music is at my fingertips 
Good quality  great sound and I would recommend them to a friend 
good sound  plays loudly without distortion  easy installation
Great rich sound  Love it highly recommended      
Great sound  Love the changing of colors  My son loves it
Great sounding speakers   alpine are quality speakers at a great price really notice sound difference
GREAT SPEAKERS FOR THE PRICE   GOT THEM ON SALE SO EVEN MORE OF A BARGAIN   LISTEN TO MOSTLY CLASSIC ROCK AND THESE SPEAKERS JAM  EVEN WITHOUT AN AMP   ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT FROM ALPINE   
Great speakers installed in my rv  We will be buying 2 more for the back of the rv
Great speakers  I installed these in my 2015 Nissan Frontier       Sounds Great 
Great Speakers  Very Good Sound and Better Than The Factory  Just Put it on a Chevy Silverado   And I m Very Happy With It 
Great speakers  Beats buying 10 speakers  amp etc   
Great value  delivered in timely manner   Pleased with purchase 
I bought these to replace the factory speakers in my 2010 F150  They are truly amazing and provide a much better sound than the stock speakers  I am thrilled I went with these 
I bought these when my factory speakers died  They sound amazing 
I compared to all and these were the best at this price point   compared to Bose and B W   richer  fuller sound with clear bass 
I had been looking to add speakers to our patio for a little while to replace the small bluetooth speaker we were using and wow these things rock  Crystal clear highs and mids with just enough bass for great dynamic sound  I have not had these installed very long but I am impressed so far  They are a little on the larger size but I was fine with that  they can be mounted vertically or horizontally  the white ones can be painted as well 
I just installed the first pair of two pair I purchased and am very satisfied with them  They are easy to install  come with great instructions  and sound great once they are installed  I was worried about possibly needing to install a subwoofer too but I don t think that will be necessary Tips  use a Roto zip to cut out the drywall and stuff insulation into the hole prior to monting the speakers
I love these so much I actually bought two of them  They are amazing 
i really like these speakers  they are much better than the stock speakers in the car 
I recently purchased a new Kenwood deck for our Suburban  I debated at Cartoys on whether to buy speakers at the same time  It immediately became apparent   the stock speakers could not keep up with the new deck  Cartoys made me a great deal on the Kenwood  I couldn t buy it for what they sold and installed it for  However  the speakers were another matter  They wanted almost twice the price for these same speakers  After surfing Youtube  i found a tutorial that showed step by step instructions on how to install speakers into the Suburban doors  Might not be for everyone but I have a solid background in electronics  wiring  sodering  etc   so it was a snap to install and set these up  I bought the first pair for the front doors  The sound was drastically improved but there was muffled noise coming from the 2nd pair in the passenger doors   so I ordered a second set  Sound quality is now great in the truck  for anyone else attempting this   make sure you disconnect the sub in the back of the truck as it is a stock POS   I may opt for an AMP and new Sub   but for now the sound is drastically improved over the stock radio  speakers provided by Chevy We recently took a road trip from CO to OR   the cost was so worth it  The trip was really enjoyable  The Kenwood interfaces nicely with iPods and iPhones so we had a tone of music to listen too during our trip
Installed in a Cobalt  replaced the OEM speakers  Sounds amazing 
Just got the speakers installed and they sound great
Love the sound clear and nice voice will recommend
Love these speakers and the deal I got when combining them with an Alpine deck  Install was professional and easy  Would recommend 
My housing needed a little modification but other than that they are GREAT 
My husband installed these in his bronco  He love the sound and bumps his music super loud 
My husband purchase this speakers for my truck and they sound great 
Simple install directions and great sound quality  Very happy with this purchase 
Sound much better in car then in the store  I wish the service to install was as great as the speakers 
The installation guys know a lot more about the products than the sales guys one of the sales guy told me a certain product would fit in my car and when I brought it in the install guy told me it would fit otherwise it s a great product Definetly recommend
These are a perfect fit for Fords  I paired them with the Kicker Hideaway sub  and could not be more pleased  They don t have alot of bass response on their own so a sub is recommended  But they are crystal clear 
These are great outdoor speakers with good sound on all levels and great built in base 
these are great quality speakers my second set  easy to install and sound great 
These are rear speakers which replaced the original set in my 1995 Honda Accord  They fit perfectly after some minor modifications to the old frame  and my man installed them  The volume peaks way higher than needed and sounds great  The old set had developed a crackling noise and was annoying  Great clarity with the new ones and I m enjoying my music once again 
These speakers are the best sounding outdoor speakers on the market for the price  I m a huge fan of Def Tech 
These speakers are very loud and clear  Makes you feel like you re in the movie with how it s set up 
These Speakers give you bang For your Buck and sound Great 
These speakers sound amazing and I m very happy with the purchase
Upgraded to these from my stock speakers  They sound great 
Very satisfied with the speakers  Would buy again 
was going to buy a amp but rold to try these speakers first they work great dont need a amp any more
Was originally going to buy a different brand but the installer suggested these as I was keeping my factory head unit  He suggested these that were actually a lower price with a price match and couldn t be happier  Great sound  
Which there was an option to charge it with micro usb
This is a good wireless speaker would recommend this item to others 
I was browsing around for a high quality portable speaker and was deciding between this and a bose speaker  The design  extra bass  water resistant and *24 hour battery life got my attention  so I decided I d go for the XB30  I didn t purchase the warranty Best Buy offers thinking I had a great speaker and I wouldn t have to worry about anything  Yep I was wrong  Battery life is terrible  I can t even get more than 6 or 7 hours on 50 to 70% volume   I have neighbors  on something that claims to go up to 24 hours? Maybe 24 hours with no sound playing and just the speaker on with the lights  Worst part is I ve only had it about a month  Maybe it s just my unit  but I m very disappointed  If Sony replies  don t tell me to factory reset because I ve tried that and it still sucks    how about giving me my money back?
I have purchased other well known brands in the past  The quality is amazing  Highly recommended 
I think it is a good speaker  it just offered to many bells and whistles for my mom 
I purchased this wireless speaker for my dad and he absolutely loves it and it sounds great  
My son bought this for his iPhone and seems to like it 
This Sony XB30 Is Really Among The Best wireless Speakers available Today  Great Sound and With Lighting Show   Simply Beautiful 
This speaker has great sound quality and the charge lasts a long time  I have really enjoyed using it 
Ultimate Ears   MEGABLAST Smart Portable Wi Fi and Bluetooth Speaker is definitely a contender for one of the best bluetooth speakers I ve ever heard  The sound is crisp  clear  and LOUD  Louder than any other speaker I feel like I ve tested  The nice thing about the speaker is that even though it reaches unreached levels of sound  it doesn t get too blown out at the higher levels  Sometimes static and fuzz can occur and I hear none of it  Like the new Bose speakers  the sound is projected in a circular fashion which I absolutely love  Being able to hear the music from any part of the room as if you were right next to it is a great accomplishment  The packaging on the speaker is slick and the unit itself is very robust and heavy  I like the fact that the speaker is waterproof  but it will be a while before I put that to the test  The only real thing that bugged me about the speaker is the APP that the company forces you to use to setup the device  I had issues getting it to recognize the speaker  installing the updates and even pairing with WIFI  Repeatedly I had to restart the app and sometimes it just would not pair with the device at all  Finally I just got it to pair with bluetooth and turned off the app  so as of now I don t use the Alexa function  I don t really use Alexa so it s not a big deal to me  but the hassle from the app itself makes me not even want to try and finish the process  So that to me is the only real detriment to the device  Other than that I think it is a great quality speaker that competes with any of the other bluetooth speakers I ve heard out in today s market  You can t go wrong with this one  but I hope they update and fix the bugs in the App soon  cause it hurts the experience 
I purchased this speaker to add a little music to our get together with friends and family  It was easy to Bluetooth the speaker to my phone and stream SiriumXM music  For such a little speaker  it sure put out a lot of music  I was very impressed with the quality of the treble and base  I would highly recommend this speaker 
If you are looking for a set of speakers to upgrade home theater system  buy this one
This speaker system is great for music and movies  I have it hooked up to my computer  and it sounds great  The Bluetooth is a great bonus as well 
These speaker sound Amazing    Added this system for my Home Theater  and cannot be more Pleased 
Absolutely great set of speakers  for a great price  Would recommend 
My son had one before and it s an excellent sound system 
This is a great speaker system  It is very easy to set up  They have a very good sound  Very happy with the system 
This is a really good speaker system  Works real well with my pioneer receiver  Have been looking for a system like this for awhile  Not expensive and puts out great sound  Glad I got it 
This small speaker sounds incredible   is linkable
This was my third Bluetooth speaker and considering the bass and the sound quality it was an excellent purchase  I only wish there were a way to turn off the Bluetooth 
My fianc bought this to take along with him  and it works great  good battery life and overall sound is excellent 
Bought two speakers so I could pair them together  Sound is great 
I was between this and the jbl charge 3 which at the time were the same price  What led me to the Sony was just the great track record I ve had with their products  The sound out of this speaker compared to the charge 3 was really close overall but I think it s obvious from the name of the Sony that the bass was more of the focus on it  With the extra bass feature aside I think it s just about the same in quality  The determining factor for those comparing the two would come down to that feature I believe  and well the light show it creates if you re into that  As far as durability the jbl may be a bit more since it is ipx7 instead of ipx5 like the Sony  Although I will say  I did drop the Sony in a 5 ft river accidentally and couldn t find it for a minute but still worked perfectly fine after I got it out 
Nice quality base sound compared to cheaper speakers  Pay the extra money for the better sound  Very nice that you can pair with additional speakers for even better sound 
This is a great indoor speaker  Long battery life and deep bass  I would definitely recommend to someone looking for an indoor speaker 
This speaker sounds wonderful especially if your one for a deep bass sound  It also has stereo fm mode on it as well  Beats out a lot of speakers for the size  I m actually going to order one for my dad  he loved the sound 
I really enjoy listening to my speaker  The sound is awesome and the mega bass really rocks
Great sounding speaker with the xtra bass and fun with lights 
We bought this speaker to replace old ones in our kids s car  Installed them our self with no issues  They work fine and meet our needs 
Bought this for in laws to use by pool  They didn t want but absolutely love it  It has great bass  Also was able to buy on sale and wish I bought one for myself 
This is a great speaker for the pool area  The kids love the great sound 
sounds great long battery life easy to set up with the app
Bought this for my nephew and it works great  Would recommend 
I use this speaker when I am cooking or in the room just relaxing  The sound quality is great and it is pretty portable 
I got this speaker as a gift and at first I wasn t sure if I would have much use for a speaker  stereo  But I am in love with this speaker  As soon as I opened it  I love the black  checkered color it has all over  It s very convenient for me because it is always connected to my phone via bluetooth  and whenever my friends come over and they want to connect their music  they can just connect their USB drive into the speaker and I never have to disconnect my phone  Great quality sound  and it works great for when I have BBQ s going on in my backyard 
The Megablast is a great sounding speaker that gets very loud  93 dB  without distorting  It�s quite heavy so even though it�s �portable� you will definitely know you�re hauling it around  I highly recommend the power up base for convenience and because charging is a bit wonky without it  the charging port is located on the bottom under a flap   Alexa works flawlessly except when the volume is high which is to be expected  As of right now  UE and Amazon are teaming up to give you 3 free months of Amazon Music Unlimited Family Plan which is a nice bonus  Unlike prior UE speakers  there�s no party mode over Bluetooth but it is available as long as you are on WiFi  Setting up the speaker is very easy when using the app and direct Bluetooth pairing is painless  The only thing I�d fault with this unit is the seeming inability to adjust the bass  mid and treble levels  Even a basic equalizer would be nice to have  At higher volumes the bass tends to drop off and the sound gets too tweeter heavy for my tastes  Putting the speaker nearer a wall or corner alleviates this some but that�s not always ideal  The 360 degree sound output is quite handy and I�m looking forward to using this during pool season  especially since it�s waterproof  Overall I�ve been quite impressed and would highly consider buying another one in the near future 
This is a very good Bluetooth speaker  Would recommend it to anyone 
Adjustable bass a plus  Others did not have  Great sound  perfect for my room 
Awesome speaker  Very satisfied with my purchase  so much so  I purchased a second speaker 
great speaker with a nice clear sound  nice and portable and very sturdy 
Great speaker with plenty of volume and the extra bass function really improves the sound quality My kids love the color changing LEDs and the strobe lights  They call it the party speaker 
I got this as a Christmas gift and have enjoyed it ever since  Long battery life and great sound 
I like it very much because it is small and portable  The sound was also great 
I think this speaker is great it has awesome sound I would recommend it
Sounds great  Good size  Only 2 complaints are that you can t pair 2 and use blue tooth and switching from surround sound  Pairing has to be through wifi  so you can t connect your Bluetooth device to 2 speakers at the same time without being on wifi  If you connect to a Sony sound bar and use 2 as surround speakers  it takes several steps to switch back to regular speakers instead of surround speakers  A setting in the app or on sound bar onscreen menu that easily toggled between music speakers and surround speakers would be great 
Speaker is exactly what i ws looking for and was inexpensive
Used it for outdoor party and it worked great  Great to use at beach as well 
A little pricey  but well worth the performance  Seems to hold up to the outdoor elements very well 
Alexa work really goodTremendous soundIncredible baseReally good

Awesome speaker  Great bass and the lights are cool too  Plenty loud enough 
Bought it for my 19yr old son and it has lasted him longer than other more expensive speakers  Great product 
Excellent sound quality and good bass on stock radio  Bass is impressive for a 5x7 when amplified  I also like how you can adjust the direction of the tweeter 
Excellent speaker for outdoor activities even in windy conditions like the beach
Excellent speaker for the sound   I am extremely happy with this device  I would buy Sony again
For a little speaker it sounds really good  Like how it can be connected to WiFi  Also wirelessly connects to my other Sony speakers for a whole home sound system 
Gave it to the MIL for Xmas and she loves it  Works well with her tablet 
Good sounding speaker portable and I like that the speaker can charger your phone
Good speaker for the price and easy to use  Love that it s weather resistant

Great value for it s cost  Great sound and easy to bring anywhere
I bought the Sony xb30 to have out by the pool and to enjoy while doing things around the house and absolutely love it  Great clarity  water resistant to handle those unplanned slashes of water  Looks really good for hosting as well instead of just an ordinary speaker 
I like this speaker because it has good bass for its size 
I love the speaker that I purchased  I thank God for the staff that helps me and made my purchased very pleasant
I love this speaker  It sounds great  I love that it s Bluetooth and it has good batteryou time 
I really enjoy the sound and the size of the item it s not too big and you can have it anywhere and hear it clearly

It s a excelent article the sound it s perfect    
love the sound of the music i played  size is adequate and easy to carry 
Love this speaker  Take it everywhere even the beach 
Not only was the sound quality good with this speaker but the light show and options for the light show were great   also the app for the speaker works well and is easy to use
So far so good  My husband and I love the speaker  It s louder than we expected which is exactly what we wanted   
So far we love this new wireless speaker  looking forward to using it in our golf cart this summer
Speaker is all I could want  Works perfect with great sound
The bluetooth speaker its very nice the sound everything its awesome  
The speaker I purchased works awesome very loud and easy to use we love it  
This is a great speaker for any activity or indoor  outdoor use  It s loud  has great bass and it the light feature turns on  off 
This is a great speaker  I use it everywhere  Work  home  school  everywhere  And the lights are awesome 
This is the best Bluetooth speaker I ever heard  Thanks
This speaker has great sound for the price  Enjoy listening to my favorite music with such great sound 
This speaker is fantastic     I was looking for one with a lot of bass and this does it     its small but has a big sound  I got it one sale and I don t regret it     battery life is good     I can go a day with playing it loud for hours and I won t have to charge it
This speaker is fantastic  I use it outside and it is loud enough to use when working in the yard or just outside relaxing  I like the speaker phone it is clear and the caller on the other end has no problem hearing me  It has a big strong battery that powers the speaker and any usb device that you have connected via Bluetooth or aux input 
This speaker is loud  I bought this speaker for my wife wife to use while teaching voice lesions and now she recommends other teachers to purchase one as well  Highly recommend 
this speaker my wife loves it has great sound   she uses her i phone to play her music on just about everywhere    
using onsite at a construction trailer for conference calls  well worth the price 
Very loud  Sounds is clear and send to have good battery life  Lights are pretty cool too  but if you re using it outside pretty useless 
Was looking for a Bluetooth speaker that had good sound quality and that you can charge your phone with  This was a good quality speaker at a reasonable price  The changing lights is pretty cool as well 
Nice to have a spare power supply or replace a missing one 
Really like the backpack it carries everything I need
Portable bluetooth speaker sounds great  Highly recommended
It has excellent sound and easy to use  I am able to listen to many different media  I am happy with my purchase 
Great sounding system for a shelf unit  Nice bass reflex and I love the DJ effects 
Love it   only thing is the speaker wires could be longer so one could move speakers farther away    would like a bass control too  But I love it   g~sons love the lights  
Excellent product  Very happy with the quality of the sound 
Sony makes an awesome sounding speakers  I have a pair  They out perform most speakers on the market today  which I ve already compared  The person who loves great audio  especially HiRes audio sounding speaker with WiFi and bluetooth  Great audio quality  I highly recommend this speaker system 
these speakes sound awsome compared to the stock ones  big world of difference and the price was great also  the installation guys were very informative and do supperb work also  i will definetly get all my car audio needs from the pro s at best buy and the geek squad crew thanks for the great job fellas   
put these in a ford ranger and am really pleased with the way they sound
I have been using the Definitive Technology   6 1  2  Indoor  Outdoor Speakers for about three months now  Over this time period I have not found any issues with the speakers  They produce the highs and the lows you are looking for with no issues  Setting them up was easy  Sound is so great I was tempted to use them indoors instead of outdoors  They have gotten wet from rain showers and continue to produce great sound 
These speakers are high quality and have a great sound  You will not be disappointed 
Can t go wrong this speaker  Great sound  Love the changing colors as the music plays 
Love this speaker it s little and can take anywhere and sounds great 
Loving this speaker  Purchased it a few months ago and it is really solid  Good overall sound  does not distort at higher volume  Highly recommend 
Speaker fills the area I wanted to perfectly  Great design and sound
Jbl speakers have great quality and sound for my vehicle
I have a 66 VW Beetle w  o a stereo  no 6 volt systems so I just bring this Sony and connect it to my smart phone and instant tunes at my finger tips
Great headphones  Excellent audio quality that you would expect from JBL  Ergonomic fit over ears and not too heavy making it comfortable for long period use  Good battery life 
We bought this hoping to get the best of both worlds of Amazon echo and Bluetooth speaker  It does great at the latter but only ok at the former Setup was super easy but had to be done thru an app  I don t believe there was any other way to set it up  As a speaker it sounds incredible  We used it at a Birthday party in a medium to large space and it easily filled the room  Things got a little tinny when we tried to see how loud it would go but in good news it went really loud  Where this speaker fails is as an Echo replacement  There is no way to leave it plugged in to use as a constant Alexa option  The charging port is on the bottom  under a weather proof flap and the cord isn t flexible enough to allow you to flip it back over and stand up regular  It s really meant to be a portable speaker at which it does excel  But then the other issue with using it as a portable speaker for Alexa is that it auto powers off after 15 minutes of no activity or use  So unless you re paying music constantly or asking Alexa to tell you the weather or stock prices every 14 5 minutes  you have to power the thing on to ask Alexa something  Far less than ideal So it s because of the latter issue with Alexa being barely functional we ll be returning it and buying an actual Echo 
I am loving these Everest headphones  They fit great  sound great  and are really convenient  Money well spent 
This speaker has a well balanced sound with good bass  It can easily fill a medium sized room with full sound  but you loose a bit of bass in a very large room  The speaker gets very loud and has several pairing capabilities which earns it good marks  Missing a built in radio tuner otherwise 5 stars 
Sound was remarkable  but I have a relatively large head  The headphones always seemed way too tight around my head and were quite uncomfortable  Had to return them 
I use this in the shower and take it on vacation trips  It s water proof so that helps  Best portable speaker I ever owned  Great sound  Solid bass  Easy blue tooth connection and the ability to charge your phone off the speakers battery is nice too  Great speaker 
I really like these JBL Everest Elite  Their outer quality is soft and comfortable on my ears and on my head  The controls are intuitive  And the sound quality is incredible for a Bluetooth headphone  The noise cancelation doesn t cancel entirely everything out  but if you re listening to music it might as well have  I do like the two levels of Ambient Aware and I like that I can use these wired if the charge dies  My only problem is that you need to hang on to the packaging as you ll inevitably be sending them in for warranty work  The charge port went bad after 6 months and the headphones wouldn t charge or power on  The same thing happened to my husband s set  They are protected for a year by JBL and the customer service experience is easy to go through  The turn around on my new set was nominal  Other than Bose wired NC  these are the only other Noise Canceling phones in their class worth the price point  And they re bluetooth without sacrifice  Despite the issue they have with the USB port going bad  I would still choose these again over the competition  I am purchasing another pair for a gift 
Good buy for the money good style use of product is easy
the guy who installs car speakers at the best buy that I purchased the speakers from was great and gave me some pointers on installing them so I did it myself  it was easy and they sound great
Great sound  Blocked out surrounding noise  Very sturdy 
Item has Bluetooth connectivity and a line input for non Bluetooth devices  Sound is great  and the bass boost works very well  Only down side is that it doesn t have a clear low battery signal  I actually returned my first one because the volume turned down for no reason  The battery light didn t turn on our anything  The second one did the same thing  I recharged the unit and it worked fine again  Barry life seems to be about 10 hours 
I purchased the speaker for my 10 year old to play her iPad through  I use it more than she does  I love the easy Bluetooth connection 
Great Sound  waterproof  and with AlexaI chose this over the Megaboom because of the extra Alexa features  If you are already familiar with Amazon Alexa  this is no different  It can do all of the regular voice commands that a regular Alexa product can do  It is more limited in that you can t do drop in  calling  or multiroom audio With that being said this speaker sounds great  I compared it to the Megaboom and the highs are a lot cleaner  I think this is due to this speaker now have 6 speakers inside vs the 4 speakers of the Megaboom 
Love the solid feel  great sound without the fuss 
There are great bluetooth speakers  great Amazon Echo devices  and now something that combines both  I ve been using a couple of Echo Dots for over a year now and have gotten hooked on using them for home automation as well as listening to news  football games  and music  I had been using an external bluetooth speaker with each in order to make the music sound tolerable  I ve now replaced the Dot and speaker combo in the kitchen with the MegaBlast and it s perfect Here are some features I really like o I keep it sitting on the charging disk so it s powered on and ready to move if I want to take it with me while washing cars or working in the yard o It s waterproof so I don t have to worry about splashing it in the kitchen or yard o It says the battery will last 16 hours which is way longer than I want to be doing yard work o The sound quality is fantastic  It s really clear even at high volume with no distortion that I can detect  It never sounded  muddy  or  tinny  like some speakers o A nice perk is that it comes with 3 months of free Amazon Music Unlimited  I have Prime  but there are occasionally songs I ve wanted that are only in the Unlimited service  It ll be nice to try it out and see how much I use it There is really only one slight negative with the speaker that I found  The indicator light on top is recessed  and this is the light that lets you know if Alexa is listening to you  If you re across the room  sometimes you don t have a high enough angle to see the light and I found that annoying  I guess I really did get used to watching the light ring on the Echo Dot so I miss being able to see that across the room  However  I think the quality speaker sound more than makes up for that loss  It s great to have Alexa in a portable  waterproof  quality speaker 
Great sound  remote is great to have for use on boat  I don t have the glare issue that others have complained about
These headphones have great sound  But when on with no music being played it shuts itself off  This is bad when looking at Facebook or looking for music on Youtube  If it takes you more than 10 minutes to come to the next video you have to take them off and turn them back on  Since the rated battery life claims to be 15 hours this  feature  is unnecessary and unwanted 
I ve had these headphones for about 3 months  They sound great  and are really comfortable  However  the construction is bad  The leather covering the foam on the earpieces has come loose and is falling off  I ve never dropped them  and only use them a few hours a day  so there s no reason this should be happening  It doesn t make them unusable by any means  just VERY unsightly 
The speaker provides great sound with a great boost to bass when chosen to use it  The strobe light on it gives it uniqueness and can be fun for gatherings  The light may be turned on and off easily as well as the option for extra bass  The downside I find with this speaker is that even when it is fully charged  that it does not maintain nearly as long as the box states it will last up to  The sound will get quiet and you will have to keep restarting it to keep the optimal volume  I have turned off the lights and the bass to see if there would be a noticeable difference and there was not  It is good for a 2 3 hour use  but don t expect to get much more than that  If the battery lasted longer I would definitely recommend it  but for the price paid with the lack of battery life I am unable to give this recommendation 
I followed the instructions and the installation and hook up was a breeze  I would recommend this product to other users 
Sounds great in our Tahoe  Speakers were easy to install and the price is more than reasonable 
I bought this to replace a radio in an older car  thinking that I would just get something passable for Bluetooth connectivity  and music  What I got instead was a feature packed  economical head unit  with amazing sound quality  It may not have a CD player on board  but who needs CDs anymore?   
This product was purchased for our daughter whose small apartment is an ideal place for it to be used  It delivers quality sound and because it is wireless it can be located practically anywhere  We are very pleased with our purchase 
I have used this product talking to friends out of the country and I was able to hear them crystal clear  The headset cuts out outside noise and the volume control works well 
great sound  was very easy to connect to phone with bluetooth
This speaker has great sound and is powerful  on the downside I sometimes have to relink it to my Bluetooth 
Checked out a few units in store  for the price point the sound produced by the Sony XB30 could not be beat  Check it out you won t be disappointed 
At first was very pleased with sound  great for direct connection by blue tooth range is lacking
Overall very good sound  The price was a little high 
I got these amazing headphones  which have a great noise cancelling function  but ended up returning them because they were a bit uncomfortable 
Replaced these with my Bose speakers that came in my car and I have to say these sound waaaay better   
I received the information from the sales person  Everything he stated about it is true  I just love my speaker and would tell my friends and family about it 
After being disappointed by the batteries on 2 different JBL Flips no longer maintaining a charge  I decided to give the Sony   XB30 Portable Bluetooth Speaker a try  So far  very impressed with the sound and the button for extra bass  I think the flashing color lights on the front of the speaker are not neccesary   I keep them turned off  but a younger person may enjoy the visual 
great option to replace premium sound for old cars 
These are stylish  comfortable and have amazing sound  I just feel they stick out too far off my ears for me personally 
As with every JBL product that I ve owned  these speakers sound great They also seem to handle a fair amount of volume without sounding muddy or distorting 
Bought these speakers for my living room along with the 6 1  2 for my master and I was very impressed with the sound that they produce  I have had  installed a lot of different kind of in ceiling speakers and these by far are the best to install in a room that doesn t have a subwoofer  They produce a good quality bass sound but not enough to rattle the walls  If you want that  you would deffinitly need to add a sub to the room  But for what I use them for which is just music  they are perfect  For the smaller rooms  I would recommed the 6 1  2 which are just as good but just a little less bass 
Everything I want in a pair of head phones  Better than I expected 
Great sound and good bass  Stays charged for a long time  Definitely a good value 
Great Sound  Comfortable headphones  Easy to sync 
Hooked this up to a Yamaha receiver and the sound is great Speakers are pretty small which is perfect so you can hide them  Subwoofer makes a huge difference as the sound is so much better 
I have owned many brands of headphones and I have found the perfect brand  I am staying with Bowers   Wilkins  These headphone will put Bose and Beats to shame  The bass is great and the sound is clear  promise you you will not believe these are not a powered headphone  I also like how easy it is to remove the cord for replacement or upgrades  These also feel great over the ear and are very light  They might have a bit of a price tag  however  You won t be disappointed by this brand 
One of my front factory speakers blew on my  07 GMC  Price at dealer was  164 to replace the one speaker  For the same price  got both front speakers replaced and the sound is noticeable better  which is saying a lot because I have old ears 
These headphones are insane they keep sounding better and better every time I use them  Very clear clean sound with any type of music you play Everything else sounds bad after using these 
These speakers have great sound and are well worth the money 
This is a smooth good sounding sleek product  I m in love 
This speaker blew me away with how loud it gets  not only that but the color around it changes which is pretty sweet and it s totally worth buying 
This system has more bells and whistles than we even need  The sound is great  We replaced another system that came in our boat  and it only lasted a few years  Hoping to get more years out of this one 
Right after I paired the Sony Bluetooth portable speakers to my cell phone  I opened my music app  Without thinking  I pressed play     holy cow  I should have turned the volume down on the phone  You d swear the sound was coming out of my Sony AV amplifier and bookshelf speakers Big bass  clear mid tones and highs  Truly amazing sound I paired the speakers and my phone with the phone s Bluetooth setup  Very easy Then I read you can load the Sony NFC app and pair your device with NFC by just touching the phone to the center of the Sony speaker  Nice feature  This is the perfect addition for my Amazon Echo DOT The unit is rechargeable so it s truly portable  The boom box sound for todays connected world  I can t wait to take it to the beach  The speaker s volume buttons control the player device s volume so be sure to turn down our phone before connecting  The LED ring glows with multi colors to your music with pulsing white lights for a dramatic visual splash 
Great sound quality and loud enough to fill a room  The built in lights that flash and change with the music are great addition  The  Extra Bass  function work really well  Over all a great little speaker with great battery life 
On the positive side  The sound is what I expected  GREAT On the negative side  The controls should be better user friendlier and the thin four wire in one connection from the system to the speakers are flimsy and easy to break  like it happened in my case  and I am trying to get it replaced but can not find it anywhere 
Only downside to sound system is that it didn t come with a carrying case 
Great sound system for indoor partygood brand and quality 
Great sound system Would definitely recommend   
Great sound system� Would definitely recommend�   
I did some review on this product nd was a great purchase  Sound greatFor a small place 
My son is very excited about his new speakers  Great Christmas gift
The home theater system is sound great and also is easy to connect  You can connect it with your cell phone bluetooth and play your music from it  I recommend the home theater system to you 
A great compact speaker for portable music  Syncs easily to phone every time  great battery life  cool light show  Very happy with purchase 
It has great sound quality  with very good base response  Comfortable to wear  Problem is the left ear no longer gives any sound  or barely audible  Want to return 
These have been great  Took them on a flight recently and was surprised at how much they blocked from the noise on the plane  And the sound was contained within  so my seat mates were unable to hear my blasting music  Definitely would buy again   and would love to get a bluetooth version sometime 
These headphones rival beats in the sound quality world  They arent bass heavy but provide more bass than Bose 
Recommended for buyers who likes to play PS4  or a small room to play loud music 
It s really easy to use plug in connect wires to TV and enjoy great sounds great for movie s and playing video games the sound is definitely good quality 
Great Sound quality  good size and great value  Definitely would recomment
I love this stereo system  Has so many nifty features  The choices of equalizers is really nice  The only thing that surprises me  is that a stereo system of this quality has only one cd capability  Wish it held more than that  but would not keep me from buying it  The volume goes up to 50 max  and holds it s sound  without any trouble  If your looking for a powerful system  this baby has it and more  I love mine 
The bass boost is very good and the sound mix is great 
Excellent sound from a compact  attractive Bluetooth speaker  Has ability to link with other speakers 
I purchased this Theater System for a friend because the sound on the TV wasn t sufficient  Setup was very easy and the sound was amazingly good for a very reasonable price  The bass was impressive and the clarity of the mid and high tones was excellent at this price point  It has room filling sound  Worth the purchase 
This was a gift idea I bought and decided to keep for myself  I went with a different gift for the recipient  This has great sound and is super portable  I have not got another speaker yet to try the dual speaker system  but so far with this one by itself it has been plenty 
I had the first version of Everest and there has been great improvement in this version  I had no trouble connecting the app and it seems the audio quality is better and the ear cups have been tweaked to be more comfortable  I really enjoyed using the app and the ambient sound mix feature 
You can always expect great sound from Sony  Had a difficult time connecting it to Google Home 
I originally walked in the store to purchase the JBL model  Luckily I walked by all of the display models and found this one to be more of what I wanted  This speaker packs a lot of sound into a small package  has very good battery life  and my son likes the fact that it lights up and flashes  I m extremely happy with this product and it s cost
The product is outstanding  it has great sound  I ve took it on hikes  the beach  pool side and even the steam room at my gym  I recommend this speaker to all my friends 
Great sound for a wireless speaker  I love the 16 hour battery life  long lasting battery  Great speaker  but over priced 
Great speaker with powerful bass  Nice range with my iPhone  Easily lasts 4 hours and keeps phone charged while while playing 
This is a great speaker due to its size and battery life  the bass is really good and sound is balanced  I had other speakers with a higher price range but the sound was not as good 
Very versatile system  Brought the equivalent of the JBL and wasn t impressed with sound  and exchanged it for this model  Key features  battery  plug  and you can charge your phone in a crunch    and very portable 
Good sound     for the price     was easy replacing the original speakers for the with the new ones
They are comfortable  great design and we re easy to connect to the bluetooth  reason for not getting a 5 star rating the volume control and the power on an off are difficult to operate when in use
Bought these to replace a set of sony speakers that were over 10 years old  I have these speakers hooked up to a Denon receiver  The sound is great for movies  video games  and music  The only down side is that the power button for the subwoofer is located on the back  May not be too big a deal depending how you got your system setup  Also keep in mind that the speaker wire is just one long piece  so you will need to cut and splice the speaker wire yourself  Overall  very pleased with the purchase 
Replaced OEM Infinity speakers in my Dodge truck  and these Alpines sound way better  I put these in the rear doors  The whole pattern didn t line up with the stock spacer  so the install took a little longer than it could have 
Have a covered patio with Definitive Technology 6 1  2 speakers mounted outside over open deck and yard  Great sound for back yard activities  
I buy audio systems by spec and I had never heard of Boytone  I m an old school audiophile and I have a set of Klipsch V4 2 PC speakers  I was looking for something decent for another application  For the money these speakers are VERY decent  The 6 5 ported subwoofer is a good design and overall sound quality is excellent for the price  The visual design is also very nice  One selling feature for me was that they are compatible with practically all current media  FM  USB  bluetooth  RCA  SD  I compared the Boytone system to the big boys  Creative  Logitech  etc   and nothing came close  Now for the small number of cons  When you switch sources the volume goes to 18 which is rather loud  Also the display is a bit cryptic  The system does not always respond to the remote on the first button press  But other than these relatively minor issues I have no complaints  I would rate them 4 5 if I could but for the price I will give them a solid 5 
Looked at some reviews of other wireless speakers and went with this model  Price was reasonable  sound quality is excellent and battery holds a charge for hours on end  Works great outside as well 
Very impressed with the sound and how easy it connects through the Bluetooth 
Excellent device to listen to my music on through my phone or other devices I would recommend this device to anyone 
We bought this for my wife to use I  Her classroom  It hides away very easily because it is so small and it has great sound  Our only issue is that you cannot charge your phone and stream music through the USB port 
The sound is excellent and connection is simple   Purchased 2 for 4 1 sourround 
My husband and I just needed something to play in our basement apartment and this was just the perfect size and sound for what we needed 
You can t beat the price  no manual included but it s easy to figure out  Sincerely it has better sound than more expensive units  you just have to play with sound settings  I am definitely purchasing another one 
Super convenient with bluetooth and has very good sound for the money 
Love my new stereo and these speakers completed the set up  Had it all installed by Best Buy  So easy and quick to purchase and install all in one place 
Surprised by Sony s new sound technology  Compared it to Bose  Altec  JBL  all I own   and very comparable
The DEF 6500 series is the best outdoor I have ever purchased  Great low end response and super high end clarity  They provide great coverage across my 25x50 patio  We listen to various music from old rock to jazz and blues and the 6500 series holds true to the test at all volume levels 
I had fuzzy sound in my car radio  replaced the tweeters awhile back which improved it  but the bass still sounded muddy  The new speakers gave me a much improved sound for cruzin  with tunes 
I recently bought this product to take on a camping trip and boy was I amazed at the sound this speaker releases  I have a few HI RES albums I purchased to listen with this and the sound is nice and clear 
I would recommend this product for anyone wanting to upgrade th sound in their car from the factory installed speakers 
After great experiences with other MEE Audio products  I bought my son  11 years old  the Runaway bluetooth headphones to replace his Koss headphones that only lasted a few months  internal solder joints broke   I ve never even owned a pair of bluetooth headphones myself  so I figured that I could get some use out of these too  which I have      My thought was that wireless would be the best way to avoid any audio problems related to wiring  which I speculate is the failure point of the majority of earbuds and headphones The Runaways have not disappointed in the slightest  and I could not be more pleased  They simply sound GREAT  Construction is study plastic  and the wear is comfortable  adjustable  with easy to control bluetooth functions  The headphones collapse for storage  within a nice included felt bag  An included stout 3 5mm cable can be used if desired  perhaps when the battery is running low for bluetooth function I am not an audiophile  but I m a music lover and have spent several years as a stage musician at a church with 7 000   9 000 congregants    so I have a decent amount of experience and appreciation for musical detail and great audio If you want to dabble in the bluetooth headphone market for a great product that won t break the bank    these Runaways are for you 
I love this product  and I was surprised at how much bass it kicks out  The Bluetooth feature is a plus
This speaker has great sound  The only not a fan of is using the song pal  Doesn t always work the best 
Nice bass and all around sound for a room or smaller party 
I purchased this for my home theater and was pleased with the quality  The product appears well made and the sound is crisp  There is obviously bigger systems out there  but for the price  approx   150   you can t beat it 
Sound is a huge improvement over my ten year old Sony speakers  Great for anyone looking for above average sound quality for a price that won t break the bank 
I went to the store with the intent to purchase a Bose speaker  The Best Buy employee was great   he gave me the low down on all of the speakers in my price range  around  100   and gave me his personal opinion about this speaker   that it was the best sound for my buck  And he was right  It is as loud as you d want a bluetooth speaker  and Sony s extra base makes it sound like a speaker you could use in your home as opposed to just on the go  It s 24 hour battery is WAY longer than any other I ve seen   which I didn t think would even be something I d need until the very first time I used it at our all day birthday party outside by the pool  I also didn t think I d ever use the USB port until the second time we used it camping  and my phone died  I LOVE this speaker   
Outstanding  tight bass with clear treble  Great definition and very functional noise cancelling  Buttons need work  UI is confusing  hold down 3 secs to turn on  etc   and cords  USB and 3 5mm Stereo  are way too short  Case fits a bit tight 
The JBL Everest Wireless Headphones had an amazing sound but they were a bit tight on the ears   heavy if you were going wear them for a few hours  My spouse has tender ears so it may just be us 
My wife and I have been using this while in a motel room for a month and a half  We like to watch baseball games being streamed over the internet  By using the sound system we are able to enjoy the full sounds of the games as it is almost like sitting in the stadium  We also use the sound system to play MP3 s and movies  The sound is fantastic 
Bought these Alpine speakers on sale for  39  Excellent sounding speakers  only wished they were a bit more shallow so they could fit under my compact car seat  Otherwise the sound is very well balance between the bass and treble 
Installed these easily in my truck  Nice full sound even without subs 
Bought these for the front my f 150 Lightning and loved them so much I bought two more for the rear 
My fiance got these for me for Christmas by my request and I love them  I wanted them for working out at the gym because I kept hitting the cord of my other headphones which would pull my phone out of the holder  I love these  They re comfortable and have great sound quality  I ve recommended them to a good friend I workout with 
Great product at a great price  Exceptional sound 
These headphones sound amazing with an incredible bass punch  Both the highs and lows boast a very high quality sound  They are big  but are amongst the best sounding headphones out there 
Excellent quality sound and loud speakers  Light weight
Great item  Sounds great and looks great  directions were easy enough to follow and not difficult to figure out and install  Would recommend this to anyone that wanted a great upgrade to in car stereo system  Lots of bells and whistles for the price 
Purchased these speakers along with the Klipsch Icon WC 24 center channel and Definitive Technologies Pro Sub 1000 10  sub  They are mated to a Harman Kardon receiver and everything sounds STUNNING  You can adjust the two tweeters on these yamaha speakers and aim the sound to the middle of the room or wherever you want  Good instructions come with it  I did not install these myself 
This is an amazing water resistant speaker  The sound is really deep  and there is an �Extra Bass� button that provides  well  extra bass The battery can last up to 24 hours  which is more than double for other bluetooth speakers I have  There is also a usb port on the device that can charge other devices The lights are OK  but there are strobe effects that are annoying  that can be turned off in the Sony app   Or  you can just turn off the lights using the button on the top Compared to others  this is my go to speaker for using outdoors  The long battery life and the sound quality are really impressive

This speaker has great sound and range  The charge on the battery lasts a long time  I took it out of the box and it was ready to go  Love it 
Perfect size and maximum sound with great base  Stayed charged a nice long time enough for a party that went until 3 30 in the morning 
IF YOU WANT THE neighbors to come a knocking at your door  then buy these loud and beautiful sony speakers 
I really love the sound quality of the speaker  Also having Alexa to answer questions is very helpful  Plus an added bonus of being fully waterproof makes this the perfect speaker for me to use at home and on camping or hunting trips  Wish battery life was a little longer but for a speaker this size it is totally adequate  Usually get about 18 to 20 hours out of a full charge 
Everest Elite 700 feel great on the ears and sound good  No issues and easy to use button functions 
Another great product from B W  Great sound quality and comfort 
Easy to use  comfortable to wear  good sound and blocks out outside noise  Storage bag is not great and price is a little high  but pay for good quality
I was used to wearing in ear headphones when I workout  so this was my first over the ear headphones  The sound quality is excellent and they are pretty comfortable  Even when I run they don t slip very much  Over the ear style takes some getting used to because ears get hot under there at some point but overall excellent 
The speaker is amazing  UE makes great products and the Megablast is no different  Quality all the way around  From the packaging to the build quality to the overall sound  A  across all of those areas  The only thing that left me wanting more  was the Bass  From a speaker this size  I was sort of disappointed in the quality of the Bass My unit came with the speaker and the table top charging dock  The packaging is incrdible  and makes sure your product is not going to be damaged in any way during delivery  shipping  To cable charge  you simply plug in the supplied USB cable into the bottom of the unit  To charge with the docking station  you simply screw in a charging station cap on the bottom and place directly on top of the charger  The initial charge took quite a long time  and was not fully charged from the factory  But once charged the battery life has been great  UE says a full charge can last 15  hours  and if you download and connect to the UE App  you can always see how much charge you have left  so you re not stuck with a dead speaker at the wrong time Setting up the speaker was super fast and simple  Normal bluetooth pairing was immediate to my Note 8  I downloaded the UE App as well and while it looks polished  it felt sort of glitchy  The app recognized the speaker immediately but had trouble running through the rest of the setup  I had to exit the app and start over twice before it let me finish the setup  Not a huge deal to be concerned with  as i m sure UE will fix the app over time  It s also nice that the speaker can be connected via wi fi and bluetooth  And you can set it to update itself via wi fi automatically Setting up Alexa was also a breeze  Simply go to the Alexa setup in the App and login with your Amazon Alexa account and that s it  Alexa is immediately available on your Megablast  We also have a few Amazon Echos in the home  and using the Megablast with Alexa felt the same as using the Echo device  Speech recognition was very good even from across the room  All the features of Alexa are right here in the Megablast  and portable  unlike a Echo  Echo Plus  I think we ll use the Megablast so much more  simply because we can move it around with us Build quality is amazing  the speaker is huge and feels very sturdy and almost heavy in the hand  Very nice  The 360 degrees sound field is also great  and you get room filling sound and great volume levels  Sound quality is also very good  as you d expect from UE  But  from a speaker of this size and build  I honestly expected more Bass  I have numerous bluetooth speakers  some bigger or smaller  some from UE and other brands  Compared to all my other speakers  the Megablast was just ok on Bass response  Don t get me wrong  the Bass is there  and for most it s probably fine  However when listening to bass heavy audio  even when EQ d  the Bass simply gets compressed and tight  not boomy  i don t think it would be a reason to not get the Megablast  the overall sound of the speaker is amazing  but if you were thinking that a speaker this size would give you over the top Bass  you might be disappointed  Having IP67 weather sealing is nice so you don t have to be worried about getting it wet A couple things I wish they would have done better  you cannot pair multiple Megablast speakers together in stereo  which for this price and category seems to be a glaring omission  I hope UE fixes that soon  I also wish that the speaker came with a 3 5mm connector  but it does not  wireless all the way  or nothing  When using Alexa  the only way you know Alexa has been triggered is if you re actually looking at the speaker and can see the LED light on top grow brighter  there is no audible tone that tells you Alexa is ready  like when using an Amazon Alexa device All in all the UE Megablast is an amazing speaker with Amazing features  and integrating Alexa just kicks it up a notch  I m very impressed with the Megablast overall 
We purchased this device for a beach vacation  The speaker is very durable  It was also quite loud  Sound is good  and you are able to charge 1 USB device while using it  Battery lasted all day 
Speaker sounds really really loud and clear with good bass and the lights make it look much cooler but it does make the battery run out quicker but overall I love it
The bass and sound is really amazing  Customizing the EQ is great as well 
Speakers very compact easy to travel with great sound system highlights of light system to the beat connect with a good distance
This speaker system sounds great  The powered subwoofer is excellent  The center speaker is larger than most and gives great sound  THe system comes with wire but I suggest ordering 16 AWG  Also  I suggest brackets so that you can angle and position the speakers in your room for the best sound  The threads in the back are for 1  4 inch screws which must be purchased separately

Ultimate Ears   MEGABLAST Smart Portable Wi Fi and Bluetooth Speaker with Amazon Alexa Voice Assistant  I purchased for the Amazon Voice Assistant which works as advertised but it does conflict with other Alexa devices if they are too close  I think I will just use it in bluetooth mode and synch with the Alexa s in the house The Sound quality is far better than the Alexa View and Echo s 
awesome sound and when I get another car if I need to replace the speakers  I will put these in it againFits a 1998 to 20002 CAMARO perfectly and I am guessing will fit in pontiac firebirds too 
This little speaker has a wonderful deep and clear sound  WOW  how do they do that  It can even be synced with another same speaker for stereo  Here lies the problem  Both speakers must me on the same network and connected to the internet  Setup is nothing short of complete frustration  and the instructions  Well  not the best  But if you can make them work the sound is amazing  Just travel with 1 speaker only 
Bought this not expecting much and it works great 
Fantastic sound on this speaker   The only thing bad to say is when the battery is almost dead it cuts out the songs you are trying to listen to
Good purshaseGood qualityAnd i bought them on sale
Great sound and very comfortable over ears  love the fact that they are also wireless
Great sound  Deep bass  Love the changing light colors 
Great sounding headphones  liked them so much had to buy another pair for my son
Had trouble connecting to my iphone via bluetooth  Finally figured out I needed a separate app for speaker to work with my phone 
I am a music fan  This stereo has many great features 
I bought two of these with the Sony soundbar and wireless subwoofer to create a surround sound system  First off  Bluetooth streaming music from my phone  the sound is excellent and really fills the room  I ve used just one and it sounds good but combine it with the surround sound system and it is amazing As for use with the surround sound while watching a movie  I find the volume is subtle and sometimes not noticeable  On a few occasions I put the speaker to my ear to see if there was anything coming out which there was  just low  Having never had surround sound I am not sure if that is how it should work as I was expecting louder  Maybe the movies I ve watched which were only a few were filmed with low volume backgrounds and I haven t put it to the test  just not sure  I m more of a music guy anyway so I am very happy with the sound when playing music so I have no regrets in buying this I will tweak some settings when I get around to it and see if maybe that is my issue and adjust my score but for now I think my 4 stars is honest based on my likes 
I had Bose headphones and the JBL puts the Bose headphones to shame  Absolute love my JBL headphones 
I love the sound of theses speakers  I wanted to upgrade from my factor speakers and I don t have any regrets 
Love that these are wireless  The sound quality is great  and noise cancelling is a big plus on a plane 
My experience with the headphones was great  Sounds very good 
Only complaint is that the stereo function when you use two only works with wifi  You can not connect two speakers with Bluetooth only
Speakers have great sound but are hard to get linked with soundbar 
The first version of the speaker was great  but the charged seemed to give out and stopped charging the device  This new version is larger  sleeker and the charger is smaller and seems to be more effective  The sound is amazing and I love the fact that I can charge my cell on the device when I am out on the beach 
These speakers really sound full and rich tones fits perfect 
This speaker has a modern look and great sound  Love the depth of the sound when playing music  Great size for travel  The associate has great knowledge on the products and this was the one for me 
This speaker has fantastic sound  it gets really loud enough to fill a room  The ability to controls the lights with am app is an added bonus  I have many Bluetooth speakers and this is one of my favorites 
After 7 pair of headphones i finally found a great pair The sound is great just as good as my Bose 
As always  excellent service from Best Buy  this is the second speaker I get and when you sinc them the sound is awesome 
Bought 2 of this speakers and i am glad i did  i have Definitive Technology speakers in my home theatre room and i love them and I am still impressed with the quality of sound for outdoor speaker s  Price is a little high but still worth it    
Bought for daughters bedroom  She loves it  Great sound  easy to use controls  and she loves the lightshow 
Bought for my husband s birthday for his boat  He loves the radio so far 
Bought these for my Mazda 3  They are powered by a Kenwood CD deck   I wanted good crisp sound with a little bass  simple clean sound
Bought these to upgrade from a pair of Proficient outdoor speakers  Richer sound  Also more efficient  Get same volume at about 2  3 of volume stting on My Sonos ConnectAmp
Bought this for a gift and was a great product for the price 
By far these are the best headphones I have ever owned  If I have to bye another set there would be it again 
Easy install great sound proficient service do recommend
Easy self install  Great sound  Best buy rep was great assisting in purchase 
Easy to use  great sound for a low price  I love it 
Even at loud volumes it sounds very clear  It is also a perfect size  not too small nor too big for a portable speaker 
For the sound it produces  the battery lasts for quite a while  You can t use it while it s charging  which is kind of a bummer  but typically that s not an issue  I also like the fact that if you have more than one  they can be linked to either spread the music over a larger area  or make the music louder in a smaller area 
Good sound and easy setup  I would recommend this item 
Got this for when I work out at home  Love it  loud and clear  Want another one  since you can sync two at the same time 
Great portable speaker  Not only the sound but the appearance itself
Great quality at affordable price  Prrduct was received on time

Great sound  Replaced the manufacturers speakers and very happy with the sound
I am reviewing the installation staff  What I thought was going to be a 1 2 hr install ended being a 3 hour  No sweat  Bryan was very apologetic and kept the original qoute as is  I am very impresseed  They are honest and I wouild go back again without question  Also I am glad I did not try to install myself 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe with Monsoon system   Let the experts do it 
I bought these not expecting much because they are wireless and small  They were easy to connect and have great sound quality  My family definitely feels like we are at a movie theater when we watch tv 
I bought this on sale and for its brand reputation  Not disappointed 
I bought this product to listen to music around the house  kitchen  bathroom  garage etc     The sound is really good  battery last a long time  the bass is good  I would definitely recommend this product 
I have owned several speakers over the years and this is by far the best out of the box speakers I have ever had  They sound great through all of the highs and lows

I researched this speaker before I bought it  Great value and sound  Very easy to setup out of box 
I upgraded factory speakers and could not be happier  Very clean sound 
I use these for the gym  where it s very noisy  They do a great job filtering out the noise and sound super  easy to connect also  Highly recommend them 
I use this when out in the field when I have little cell service with my downloaded music  It s got great sound and lasts longer than my phone 
I was originally considering Sony  but after trying Bowers   Wilkins a headphone in store  I decided to get Bowers   Wilkins  I thought the Sony had too much bass and the salesperson told me that he would get a headache from the bass if he uses the headphone for a long time  With that in mind  I tried both headphones and I think the Bowers   Wilkins bass is just right for me so I chose this one instead  I am not into the look of the headphone but the most important thing on headphone is the sound quality 
It has very good sound quality  don t regret it at all 
It s like listening to my CM9 towers at home  I highly recommend them 
It s loud and clear  lights give it an extra touch 
Love Sony brand divices and the sound of it it is the best
My favorite thing about this stereo is the bass and I can hear it at the other end of the house  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great stereo
My speakers sound good nice and clear good all round
Nice look and great sound with light effects Long life
Nice to have it connected with our Bluetooth devices and play our favorite songs
Outstanding quality in a small package  Very clear detailed sound 
Paired with my Alpine 6x9 speakers  the sound in my car is fantastic 
Purchased and installed in a Mazda Miata  Super great speakers that definitely fill out where the stock ones lacked  Would recommend 
Quick to set up and sync with the television  Love the sound 
Really good sound from a little speaker  Can t go wrong with this one 
Really good sound good  A lot and shopped around a lot I am super happy with these
Sounds great and is easy to use  Went in and out a few times but think that was from having the source too far away from the speaker  not an issue with the speaker itself 
Super sound  it does have trouble connecting to the blue tooth on my phone  Other than that everything is great 
Surprised of the sound that comes out of something little
Takes your music library to new hights I was looking for Headphones that were a step above the high end massmarket It was well invested money  and there is no going back  excellent sound and comfortable 
The sound in these headphones is great  The sound is crisp and clear  bass is phenomenal  Can t hear any outside noise with it on 
The sound is awesome and its even better that it can be wireless or wired
The sound is booming  it s a better quality sound in my classroom 
The sound quality to price ratio on these is great  I work for a HiFi store and I ll hear things on these that I can later only pick up on our  nearly  100 000  reference system 
The sound was amazing  I love listening to it  I use it when I m doing my photography shoots 
The speaker works very well through bluetooth  It has good base and has colored lights that correlates 
The speakers were my second choice  but I m very happy with them 
These headphones are great both in sound and eases of use  Simply plug them to charge them and then set them for discovery in Windows go to Bluetooth and pair IPhone set them to discovery and scan for them or better yet download the JBL App and let it do the work for you 
These headphones deliver a superior sound 2nd too no other  They are very comfortable and easy to use  When I was shopping  I listened to Bose and Beats but picked the JBLs because of the sound
This is a powerful little speaker with great sound  Easy to use
This is my first set of Bluetooth headphones and they work perfectly  Great range and great sound  Last all day at work 
This is one of the best sounding small Bluetooth speakers I have purchased  I bought this to use on my golf cart  I can even hear it with the windshield down and going 15mph

This Sony Bluetooth speaker delivers great sound and can also act as a charger for your device as it has a USB port built in for charging
This sound system has great performance of sound with good quality
This speaker does all i wanted and more  Great out by the pool 
This speaker has great sound especially when you add more speakers to your collection  The bass sound was great  I didn t like that it didn t have a handle and that I couldn t turn it on remotely  but other than that it is worth the money and the lights make it fun 
This speaker works great with my Iphone  The sound is great and has lots of bass 
Typical Sony product  Great sound at a great price

Wow  This new Bluetooth speaker from Sony sounds great  It has a USB for charging and visual lights that really brighten up your party   
While changing channels could be slightly smoother  this is a great solution for watching tv on the go  or saving you the money of renting a 2nd or 3rd cable box 
My wife struggled with separate remotes especially when I was traveling  Now I don t have to walk her through the steps to watch a DVD  Crisis averted  I would put the FF  play and reverse buttons lower on remote  Good overall performance and convenience 
Installation Easy  I was able to do this myself without help  just need a stud finder and basic toolsAppearance Professional look  the cable guides work well Good Buy
This bag is lightweight and has plenty of room to carry my camera  18 140 and 70 300 lenses  along with the flash and other small items  Love the pockets spaces also 
I love my new tv and I like how the HD channel are so pretty and etc 
Needed something to use outside on the porch  and also by the hot tub   what a great find  Awesome sound and easy to use with Pandora  Love it 
My wife   I have purchased many of these types of boxes   this the BEST
I travel for work and use the sling box every day  Great purchase that I actually get full use out of 
this is a must accessory if you plan to own a surface 
You will love the size and sound of this Bluetooth speaker  Easy to use and very travel friendly  Can t go wrong  Buying a second one would be twice as good for a large area 
I mainly bought this because it was on sale  But I am satisfied with the weight and the tracking of the mouse  It is simple and a great desktop mouse  If you are using this for productivity and minimal gaming I recommend it  The battery isn t impressive at all but if its sitting at your desk all  just plug it in overnight 
My router is located on opposite side of the house and with plaster walls signal quality was poor when using the laptops embedded Wi Fi MIC  Purchased this in hopes of obtaining better signal quality and it was a great improvement
I have been looking for something that is very simple for my mother to operate  This system is great for her  She loves it
Easy to setup   works perfectly   the sound is very well balanced
Great speakers for the price  At first I was a little hesitant because of how they were priced but it is a good system 
I love my new headphones  I also purchased the AudioQuest Dragonfly headphone amplifier and when paired with it  the sound quality is amazing  Does a great job of cancelling noise too 
These headphones sound really good  better than I expected 
Set up was very easy  I have been able to connect to all my devices  iPad  Galaxy III phone  home PC  Bluetooth speaker  without a problem  I have not tried to answer calls with the headphones yet  but it seems relatively simple  I have had them for about a month and I haven t had to recharge the battery yet  They seem a little fragile  I haven t dropped or banged them on anything yet  But i feel if i do they may break or stop working  I would recommend getting the extended warranty the store offers just to be safe 
Is always good service from the moment I get there and check out 
Great service Great Product
Great seller  great item
Works great  and is a lot cheaper than purchasing a new head unit 
I haven t miss a call since i installed this ringer
Came very fast and works great
Got these on my Mazda CX 9 2009 model  Excellent treble and highs  and does a decent job on lows but the bass guitar can sound a little twangy   which is fine as it is at least defined and for really deep bass you need a separate subwoofer  Got all 4 changed  One was buzzing so went back and the cone was distorted  Best Buy changed it for me in no time 
This remote does it all  After reading the set up instructions and taking the time to set everything up this remote does what it is advertised to do  For the first time user take the time to customize each segment during the set up  If you forget something it is very easy to return to the set up and add options 
Lots of features I bought 1 for my car and a 2nd 1 for my utv  The bluetooth feature works perfectly with my work phone that is an iphone 6 and my personal phone a Note 4 i have not had any connection issues and the price is really nice 
My Logitech 880 was starting to have some problems after 10 years of use  As much as I love that remote this one has been a pretty decent replacement for it  I still think the 880s button layout is better though 
Great replacement for my Harmony One  Took a few minutes to set up even though the software support is different  Could still improve the interface and all  The placing of the buttons though also could do some improvement where the touch screen should be on top  and the rest of the buttons can rest below 
Got this item as a replacement for my Harmony One and it did not disappoint  From setup to finish  I was able to utilize the user friendly menu from the CD  PC setup and programmed all of my components with ease 
I have a Surface Pro 3 and this keyboard is a great replacement for the one I originally had purchased an had worn out  Like the Fingerprint security option 
These replaced factory speakers in my 2007 GMC Sierra  Sound great for price
Great remove easy set upjust like my old harmony but with more bells and whistles
Awesome remote  Easy to set up and use  It s very intuitive and customizable 
We ve had this remote for a day and I m very impressed  out of the box  you install an app on your PC  plug in the remote via mini usb to the computer and then tell the remote which devices it will control by make and model number  you then choose your 50 favorite channels and it works as advertised  there is a guide button at the bottom that immediately brings up our FiOS guide on the TV  one addition that would be nice would be a numeric key pad  I usually push guide and type in 500 to start at beginning of HD channels to surf  with this remote  guide opens on the channel you are on and then you surf remote moves seamlessly between tv  apple tv and dvd with tv channels being chosen by cable box  also  there is a rewind  pause  play  FF buttons on top for controlling live tv or DVD I love the fact it charges in a base station I will buy one for other TVs in house too  we have not tried it on Xbox yet 
Bought this remote after purchasing a new tv and home theater system  I had so many remotes lying around that it was driving me crazy  Bought this remote and it was one of the best purchases I ve made  Setup is simple  It took 10 minutes  Definitely worth getting
Previous remote was a Harmony one  All programming transferred over with ease 
great remote  COMPLICATED  but great remote  i would not buy this for my grand parents  but if you take the time to learn it then you will love it  the touch screen is nice 
Great remote  Easy step by step directions to connect to all electronics 
It took me about two weeks to finally get used to the remote and I love it  Don t get discouraged at first  Take your time to set it up and get used to all the features  Good buy 
This is a great flexible remote that s easy to program  Just be sure you remember to put it in the charger every day or two 
Unit is one of the best for setting up all your remotes  Software is up to date with current devices 
I have three of these Harmony Ultimate One remotes  one in my living room  one in my bedroom  and one in my gym  They all work great most of the time  I love the convenience of pressing one button and everything turning on and adjusting to the correct inputs  however my biggest issue with these remotes is that a lot of times  they will just freeze up and you have to click the help button and it will check all the inputs and settings and start back working  I m sure this is a software issue that hopefully Logitech will eventually fix with a firmware update 
This is a great remote for handling all your IR remote duties  I got it on sale for a very good price at Amazon  which made it an even better deal  My only negative would be that you can t make the icons larger for selecting favorite channels  The icons are too small for somebody like my mom when she s over and watching TV  I plan on getting the Harmony Home Hub now that it works with Alexa  I have several Dots and an Echo  
I have used this remote for several months now  As expected  it is a solid replacement to my Logitech Harmony 880 that was 10 years old  My only complaint about this remote the battery life  The remote doesn t beep to notify you the battery is low  It just sorta dies  Nothing you can do but put it on the charging cradle and wait  Its difficult to predict when the battery will die leaving me with the opportunity to walk over and manually turn my systems on 
I like this remote a lot  I like that the screen lights up and it has a screen of favorites  Very easy to use but the screen is a bit touchy and quite expensive 
I came in to replace my remote because it broke and was under warranty  The model I had was obsolete  so best buy refunded the money and I was able to get another remote that is awesome  After I figured it out 
This is my 3rd logitech harmony remote so it is fair to say that I am a huge fan  I have 2 Harmony 880 s right now and love the usability factor  I was a big fan of the idea of having a touchscreen feedback  but the tactile vibration feedback makes it very easy to determine if accidental presses occur  My only issue and complaint is the battery life  It seems that I charge this every week while my 880 s still go for several weeks on a single charge  I think the touchscreen really does allow for use nice customization  but at the expense of battery life  I can t decide if that s a scarifice that is worth making  I still think the 880 is my favorite remote ever made 
This is a great remote  A lil on the pricey side sure  but worth it  VERY easy to setup  easy to use   looks sharp  Battery stays charged for a longtime  Haven t found a product yet in my home that this can t control  I HIGHLY recommend this product 
Recommended by a friend and it s great  One remote to start everything  Easy to use 
Great remote  The screen is very sensitive so it changes screens quick 
Had a little trouble with setup had an old version on the software on my computer  After that the remote works great  
A small learning curve but amazing afterward  Extremely pleased with this remote 
Easy to use  Durable and simple  Works from any angle 
I bought this remote for my husband for Christmas  so we could link several items to one remote  TV  DVD  Dish  Sound system   I chose this one as it had a touch screen in addition to traditional buttons  We love the feature on the touch screen where you can program your favorite channels  This definitely is a new convenience for us when channel surfing  It has a charging stand that must be plugged into the wall and holds a charge for several days  The only negative was that it was difficult to set up and took a couple of hours to get everything programmed correctly 
I was looking for a nice touch screen remote  I had no problem shuffling between 2 3 remotes  The girlfriend on the other hand was much too confused  The set up was easy and didn t take long at all  It s a breeze to navigate through and simple enough for a child to use 
Love this remote  It s easy to use and have not had any problems at all  Love the  help  feature where it finds the problem with my equipment and corrects it 
Love this remote  The touchscreen is a bit sensitive  but once you get used to it it s amazing  I also love the favorites feature  The remote does more that control my audio  video equipment  I programmed my motorized window blinds into it as well 
This is my second Harmony remote  The first one was the square one  I liked it but it was getting a few years old and required two hands all the time  This time I wanted something for one handed operation  This works quite well  I only have two complaints   I wish the number screen was next to the favorites as it takes more time to toggle between both  Also when you choose the numbers  there seems to be a bit of a delay that can mess you up when you want to put a channel number in fast  Otherwise a great remote that I am very happy with 
This remote replaces all remotes you can possibly use  It works with a sound bar  Roku  Samsung Ultra 4K  programmable for other TV s in the house  I love the screen and how it shows pictures of the devices 
Very pleased to only have ONE REMOTE to operate everything  Highly recommend  
What a great remote to eliminate the mess of remotes from the cable box  TV  entertainment system  Blue ray etc  I have one and purchased this for a family member 
I have several activities that use different home entertainment devices  The Logitech Harmony makes it simple to activate the ones I need  control them  and to turn off the others  And  you can switch instantly from one activity to another  Easy to program  too 
Pros  The Harmony Remote handles all TV Sound Bars DVD VHS devices  It makes switching from device to device very simple  My wife always had trouble when trying to switch back to TV from watching a DVD this product make the process easy  Cons  One issue it is very sensitive  can be fat fingered easily which is frustrating some times  You need to learn to be accurate and move quickly  do not pause on the buttons  Another issue comes from the battery which you can t top off the charge nightly must let it run down over a number of days so it doesn t get a short memory  I was told it is not a replaceable battery which it should be  A little pricey if the battery can t be replaced in a few years 
I got this remote to control my tv  sound bar  bluray and cable provider  Works great and anytime things get out of sync the simple instructions ge me going again 
I have been a Harmony Remote owner for many years and this is by far the best one I have ever used  The ease of setup is so simple  You cannot go wrong with the Ultimate One 
Love this remote it replaced 3 remotes with 1 and was a breeze to setup  If you have a harmony remote already be careful the existing remote may be on a different software than this new remote  Go to Harmony com download the new software and setup this remote then add your existing remote to the account as well  Unfortunately you ll have to create a new Harmony account but at least you can put up to I think 8 remotes on the account which is awesome 
Harmony remote is great ever one in my family can use it with ease
It helps replace several remotes and you can access all your devices with the touch screen  Easy to use 
Great universal control tales time though to understand how to use it if you are familiar with this brand it helps to learn faster
Like many Im a long time harmony user from the one to the 900 and now ultimate  ultimate one and the smart control Todays smart tvs have netflix and amazon prime  plex  etc built right into their interface  thats where the second execution functions by holding down a button comes in handy with out having to set up a separate activity  i e watch tv activity normally controls tv and cable box but netflix is built into tv interface  well you can program the netflix command to appear on the screen of the remote or the red color button or what ever button you choose and then use the long press command to use for the tv controls as the short press commands will most likely control the cable box since that is what the main use for that activity will be used for    the point is that todays smart tvs   smart boxes etc require much more functionality than the old harmony remotes were best used for many negative reviewers dont seem to put in the time or energy into looking into the possibilities of programming options that these remotes have  its almost endlesssequence commands are back and longer sequences are possible than with the harmony one  with a lil imagination can do anything you wantcommand delays come in handy for devices with long boot up timestouch screen sensitivity can be adjusted for the accidental touchesyou can program the play  pause  rewind  ff  skipahead  skipback as secondary commands on the directional pad if you don t like the default buttons being on top of the remote as many complain aboutyou have the ability to leave certain activities on when changing other activities and will ONLY turn off when pressing the power button   i e  play xbox 360 activity can be set to leave on if you want to take a break but not loose your spot in game to watch a tv   i only mention this because it seems like teenagers are the ones who complain about this feature most with out researching enough  so although I understand how diehard harmony one fans may not like new remote  you have to realize that there is more potential with these remotes than before  I have swapped out 3 harmony ones and one 900 to 2 harmony ultimates  one ultimate one  and 2 smart controls    smart control is my favorite remote  
This remote has definitely helped clean up my entertainment center of too many remotes lying around  It works with all my devices and I definitely recommend 
very good friendly control for anyone a good way to cut down time com
While this is my first day using it  I must say that I love this remote  Many of the issues that other users have cited have been solved  For instance  the touchscreen locks after inactivity  so you can easily press buttons above the screen without worrying about accidentally pressing commands on the touch screen  I also love that I can change per device command delays  screen brightness and button backlighting  It s also worth noting that the picture shown includes older firmware  The newer firmware looks more modern and sleek  and like it s predecessors  can control the Xbox One and Xbox 360  I couldn t get my old remote to do that  The dock is also pretty cool That said  there are a few cons   The top buttons are a bit awkwardly placed  They can be hard to get to   The remote comes with a pre set button press delay of 0 1 seconds  At first  I thought the remote was just slow at processing commands  but it s actually a setting so you don t confuse older components  I wish it was more obvious so I would have changed it sooner to remove that annoyance   There are no physical number buttons on this remote  This does not affect me as I do not have cable  dish  antenna  but for those who do  this could be an annoyance   This one s weird  I wish it were heavier  I m coming from a Yamaha universal that came from my RX V575 and was pretty great  and was also heavier  I wish this remote was heavier seeing as it s more powerful and much more expensive  If I m going to spend 200  on a remote  it should feel substantial in my hand All in all  none of those cons were enough to remove even one star  This is  by far  the best remote I ve ever owned  As this is only my first day with it  I ll update this review in a month or so  once I ve gotten past the honeymoon 
What a great product  Easy to set up and use  Definitely would recommend to anyone 
If you are looking for a quality remote to control all of your home theater devices then this is a good option  Still can t control my PS4 with it but that should be resolved eventually  not necessarily Harmony s fault  
Easy setup for all devices  All you need to know is the model number and the settings on each device for output and you ares set 
Love my Symphony  I had an earlier model which broke and decided to replace with this upgraded model which was on sale  Best Buy was able to program it for me and I now have my favorite TV shows programmed for me to get to in one click I am also able to get to smart TV in one click also  All these I had a hard time getting to before The screen is also clearer and very user friendly  I would recommend this remote 
This remote is super easy to install  works with all my devices  and charge is great for heavy use 
We purchased this remote to enable us to manage several items  TV  DVR  Blue ray player  XM radio  and multi CD player  This eliminated many remotes   It works like a charm 
Easy to setup  very intuitive and works perfectly 
I love this remote i can go any where in my house with out it
I bought this hoping to replace one that looks just like it but also supports communicating with the home control hub  Unfortunately  this one doesn t support that feature  only its own standalone IR features  While not a deal breaker for me  don t make the same mistake if you re looking to replace a dead remote that you use with the wifi home control hubs 
Great remote and highly functional  i don t love the touch screen for numbers  I still prefer the older harmony one for buttons  but these are nice in how they can be changed directly on the remote  They do need more customization capabilities in terms of what I can make the remote do    but still a nice unit 
I would highly recommend this product  It is so much improved over the last remote we had 
Purchased this to replace remotes for several devices  TV  Blue ray  DVR  and to control Sonos Playbar  Setup was very easy and did not take any time at all  Just log into app and add devices from database and finalize  Like the ability to add favorite channel icons and actions  Should finally allow some technologically challenged family members to be able to use the entertainment system  I can see the remote being easy to damage so have kept young kids from using it 
I was a little nervous about buying this remote given several negative reviews  I m very glad I found the courage to buy it because it is  without question  the best remote I have ever owned 
A great remote but hard to get to the numbers so you can key in channel  A little hard to navigate  I love the fact that you can program your favorite channels though and just touch whatever you want to watch and it goes right to that channel
Best Logitech remote that I have own  Has a glitch with working with Apple TV but I reprogrammed it and now it works fine  Only downside is it doesn t warn you when the battery is about to die 
Easy setup via the internet APP  Easily controls my TV  receiver  cable box  and apple TV  My only critique is when using the favorite channel buttons on the touch screen sometimes results in the wrong numbers being transmitted to the cable box  This seems to be a weird lag issue with the remote  ***Got this remote on sale for  150  would not pay  250  don t know why the price went back up ***
Great remote that is easy to set up and use  Its a bit more expensive than standard universal remotes  but I enjoy it nonetheless 
Great remote  Easy to set up and use  It works with any device and makes it easy to control multiple devices  Definitely worth the investment 
Great remote  Easy to use  The only draw back would be that the battery doesn t last that long but does come with a charger 
Great universal remote  simplifies all my remotes into one and is easy to use 
I bought this remote to replace my Harmony H659 which no longer updates  The new unit has some nice features and sets up easier than my old unit  The touch screen can be a little  trippy  with my big fingers 
I love it is hands down the best remote control that I ever owned
I love the latest edition of the harmony remotes  The layout of the buttons is eprgonominaly good  You can do so much with the touch screen  I just started experimenting with the color buttons on the bottom and what they do  Nice surprises  I highly recommend this remote to anyone considering 
Love the display screen  Slow turning on all devices
Nice remote control for my entire entertainment package  I am able to access the features on all devices of my system  Amp  Receiver  TV  Blue Ray  Gaming systems  if I have one  it will control it  With all this power  it is a little hard to set up and likes to be recharged alot  Still  It easily hits all my needs 
No issues   Connect all an it is great experience  Will recimmes
The remote is easy to operate  The only complaint I have is I would like the touch screen to be at the very top instead of the middle of the device due to the screen being very touch sensitive 
The remote works well and looks great  Awesome customization  Button layout could be better though 
This Harmony replaced my 7 year old Harmony 840  It was super easy to setup and when I replaced my amp was even easier to reprogram it 
This is a very convenient remote control and works great
This is my 2nd Harmony remote  For some reason I had trouble programming and it still will not work with my Samsung DVR box from Optimim  I will have to manually teach it commands  What a pain 
This remote is amazing  I love how it replaces all my other remotes  Would get 5 stars but you have to buy an additional box for it to work on my ps3 which they don t make anymore 
This remote is very easy to set up and use  It fits well in the hand  The battery life could be better  I get about three days on a charge with what I would consider average use  Overall I like the remote 
This remote was a decent replacement for my logitech 1100 that died after so many years of use  It has a decent shape and is easy to program  takes a bout 4 5 times to get used to the menu functions but that is pretty much with any new remote  Charge holds pretty good  for solid daily use can be about 5 7 days and it will start to drian  but it charges super quick  so if its dying out put on a movie and set it on charger and it should be pretty much full by end of the show  Would recommend  and I am also thinking of getting one for my bedroom also  much better than my cable remote  Regards

Works as advertised  Easy to program  A little sensitive to handle 
Works very well   Very easy to program especailly if you already have aHarmony remote   Just copy the settings from the Harmony website Very happy with the remote 
Works well with the tv an cable box  I love the ability to store favorite channels with the remote 
Always been a fan of Harmony remotes  and this doesn t fall short  Really like the fact I can pair this with the Hub and expand its usage 
Awesome Remote works my 4K tv stereo blu ray surround sound  A little tough to program with the 4K but I got it done
Best remote out  I in fact bought a second one for my father  Very easy to set up  if you are a bit tech savvy I have researched universal remotes a lot  This is my fourth Logitech remote and it is the best one to date  Other companies universal remotes are either too cheap or too expensive  ranging  500 and up 
Bought it to turn on my TV  Sound Bar    Cable Box all at one time and it works great  I have a Samsung Sound Bar with I could not program with my Universal Cable Remote so I wanted to Harmony Remote and it worked after a little research   Had to change the scan rate for it to work   I also bought it to switch all my components to watch movies on my htpc  The Harmony remote even work to control my PC via an IR USB dongle 
Bought this for my husband he was using 4 remotes  He loves it 
Bought this to replace an older logitech  I love the touch screen  I like how it s so customizable and you can add channel shortcuts to the screen so you re not constantly using the guide
buying this allows me to reduce the number of remotes I use from four to one  easy to setup and use 
Does it all in the palm of your hand and can switch from watching TV to wTching dvd yo radio and much much more
Easy setup  love that it controls an Apple TV  Touch screen is very sensitive but easy to get used to  Highly recommend 
Easy to set up and use and works on all components  Best remote I ve bought 
easy to set up easy to use nice to only need one remote
Easy to sync with previous remote and easy to use 
Got it as a present   person loves it  Many cool buttons with very easy set up and access to all the channels at your fingertips 
Great remote and programs easy with a computer  One remote to do everything   Wife loves this     Thanks
Great remote happy we don t have to use 4 remote any more 
Great remote  controls multiple devices  activity based  and easy to program
I bought the Harmony after having other more expensive smart remotes  Very easy to program  Took me just over an hour  It controls everything  Would highly recommend it 
I enjoy this remote  once you get use to learning how to change between option to control the unit you are using  It is amazing at how it learns every control that my electronic has on the original remote  It is not for beginners as it can be frustrating if you are not that savvy with electronics  However if you are it is a wonderful remote and it does learn and can control all of you electronics in your home I have all my TV s  all my Blu ray  sound bars  receivers  it will control any electric you add to this device I do recommend this product 
I got this remote as an upgrade to my old Harmony Remote 900  The old remote still worked well but did not control my new LG TV the way it should  This one was very easy to install as an upgrade and with very little effort controlled the new TV just from the data from the 900  I did add favorites to the new one which was very easy and is also very handy  I highly recommend this remote  It controls well without breaking the bank 
I got this remote on deal of the day for  99 plus hub from deal of the day for  49 and is working great  I connected my TV  Xbox One  Nvidia Shield  Wii and Wii U  Also works with Amazon Fire TV and Alexa  No more other remotes  Needs good setup and Ready to Go 
I love it  controls everything  Not difficult to set up and easy to use 
I loved this remote from the time I promramed it from my computer
I replaced an old logitech 650  All the Logitechs are easy to program just input your information and it programs all the macros for you 
It was easy to program and we love it so far   it took about three hours but I am not that techy
It s pricey but I like the features   we have tried other cheaper universal remotes and this beats them hands down  It does a lot and it s great not needing to have all the other remotes lying around  It has a nice range  easy to use  easy to set up  Absolutely no problems 
Its worth the money  Very good functional remote  We love it
I ve tried different remotes and this one by far is the best  Custom backgrounds  updated software  and you can program it to use with any device  I use it with the Hub and I m more than happy 
Love the way you can just choose an icon of your favorite channel and not need to flip through the guide
Love this remote  works well with all my devices and I love that it works with the Xbox one as a DVD remote 
nice to have one instead of trying to use multiples 
Once you get the hang of it  it s amazing 
Once you get used to where the buttons are this remote is one of the best I ve used 
Outstanding remote  Easy to setup  Charging stand a bonus 
Perfect remote for the perfect tv  Wait  Any tv  Easy to use 
Purchased two of these remotes and absolutely love them 
Really love this remote as I can now use one remote to control everything  Takes a while to program everything at first but once you have everything programmed it is great  Sometimes annoying that you have to be pointing it directly at the tv or cable box so it will pick up the signal of what you are trying to do  Overall it is a great control 
Remote was easy to setup and program  An absolute must for any home theater setup 
Remote works great and was easy to set up  Works great with Comcast favorites
replaced all of my remotes except for the PS4  You also have to by a receiver for the PS3 but once you do it works fine  I had 6 remotes before this  Now just the one  Works great  easy to set up and use 
The Harmony is my go to remote  I ve set this remote up for myself and others  The harmony is very easy to setup  specially if you are just doing basic activities  For regular users the only time I would recommend help with installation is if you want second zones  special buttons  etc programmed into the remote 
the remote is easy to program love the 50 ch memory
The Remote is great     I was able to get rid of 5 remotes total 
The remote was very easy and quick to set up and even easier to use 
These work really well  I have one and bought one for my parents  They re pretty easy to set up on your own  the software walks you through everything  I set them up using a laptop with Windows so I m not sure how or if it would work with iOs 
This allowed me to consolidate 5 different remotes into one  Setup was very easy  Highly recommend it 
This is a great remote and so very easy to program 
This is a great remote  and setup is easy  I would absolutely recommend this 
This is a great remote  A little smaller than the harmony it replaced so took a little getting used to 
This is a great universal remote  I love the favorite channel display and the color touch screen  I also like how the illumination can be set for various amounts of time  which helps preserve battery life  The handy charging cradle is a plus as well 
This is a replacement of my Logitech Harmony one  which I loved  Still getting used to the differences  but love it 
This is really nice remote for the money the software syncs really nice and the remote was simple to program all of my viewing activities  
This is the second Harmony Ultimate remote that I have purchased  It is easy to set up and offers every feature you need in a universal remote 
This remote handles all my needs that combine all my remotes in one and is easy to use for a beginner 
This remote handles all of my needs  Upgraded from the 700 
this remote replaced an older model and i was able to get all our accesories on one unit rather then many remotes
This remote replaces another Harmony remote that I had for several years  It is easier to use and I really like being able to use one remote instead of the four I no longer have to use 
This remote was a replacement for a Harmony 550  It blows the 550 away  Ergonomically  a much better design  I like the ease of use  It runs through the commands much faster  so it turns on and off the devices much quicker  I run a TV  Blu Ray system  VCR  yes  I still have one   plus the cable box off of it  I use the Blu Ray system to run the audio for a Wii  yes  we have one of those  too    The remote has a charger  base  so I don t have to worry about batteries  The touch screen is very nice and responsive  It can be adjusted for background and lock time  It s a breeze to program from the computer  and can even be adjusted from the remote  I would highly recommend it 
This remote was easy to set up and very easy to use  If you know how to use a smart phone you can use this remote  We now have one remote versus 4  It is so nice to touch one icon and have all of the devices sync up and be ready to watch TV or insert a DVD to play a move  I had read prior reviews and after setting up and using ours  I am surprised by some of the negative comments  I bought one for my father  he is not computer literate nor uses a smart phone but I am confident that he will have no problem at all using this device 
This was a gift for a friend that was using 6 different remotes and she loves that all she needs is this one 
Very easy to program and very easy to use  Have told all my friends about it 
Very easy to set up  program  This is the third Harmony I have added to our collection and would add another if needed 
We are loving our universal remote  It is a great product and we highly recommend it 
Works well  easy to use  Works well with Blue Ray  Cable and Apple TV 
Has all the features you need to control a movie room  Need to make sure you charge it when not in use 
Extended my service very well  Very easy to use  Great product for the price 
I love that this unit doesn t bother to have a CD player  after all  who needs that these days?  Best feature is the bluetooth connectivity  my phone links right up to it and makes it super easy to stream from my phone  music  Youtube  Netflix  etc  All great for listening through the sound system in my vehicle 
I bought this radio and speakers to put in a project vehicle I m working on  Easy installation and wire up  Perfect radio for people looking not too fancy but not Stone Age either
We love the new stereo we put into our pontoon  It replaced the original Sony stereo that had quit working  Love having the USB option as well as the blue tooth  We are able to connect several different devices for access to our music  The radio is picking up lots of stations we were never able to get on out original one  Lots of new technology since the original one  We really love this one 
I installed this into my 2002 Honda Odyssey  It was quite easy to do  I bought the harness at best buy as well  I got a crimping tool and butt splicers from Home Depot for connecting the wires  First thing I noticed was it noticeable improved the audio quality over the oem receiver  Bluetooth and usb performance are flawless  It supports Siri eyes free on my iPhone  It also supports hands free calling with the included microphone  I installed the microphone behind the steering wheel so that it faces the driver  I highly recommend this 
although you should upgrade the front speakers and the deck first  this is a good addition to any system
I bought it for an old laptop  It is incredibly reliable  It picks up signal from the garage where my modem is 
Purchased speaker mainly for outdoor use and was surprised how well it performed 
This increased my range and signal  Best purchase yet
We use this for a Facebook live broadcast of a event in a hotel Ballroom Worked flawlessly 
I wanted to find some RAM that would match my Alienware PC DDR4 2400 and this was it  The casing threw me off at first but seems to work just fine 
Awesome                                                       
Works flawlessly and my machine has been brought back to life 
Good performing RAM for the price  Easy to install  Make sure to set bios to work with the new speeds 
I ran this RAM at 2133 MHz because at the time I had a 6th gen Intel processor  I really did not have any issues with the product except for the fact that on several non Z series mobos  MSI  Gygabyte  it would only run in single channel mode and unfortunately did not have a Intel XMP profile  really not a big deal if you research stable OC voltages and don t get hung up on stuff you don t need   But none the less I was able to play any game I wanted with ease  16 GB at 2133 really is more than most people need and chances are if you are just beginning to build your own PC this will be an extremely good upgrade  It runs very fast  stable and most of all cool  I am posting some pics below and this setup has never ran past 28 degrees even when I have increased voltages  A good tip for any new builder is to just spend the extra cash on a Z series mobo so you can really play with and learn what your RAM and CPU can do  PNY has also honored their lifetime warranty for me with two other products with little hassle so I can t complain  Do some digging around and you will find this is a great  90 110 upgrade  PNY is great via email but not so much by phone btw 
Installed nicely  Motherboard instantly recognized  No problems since 
As it is a two pack  it gives you enough RAM for gaming 
I purchased this ram for a new build  It works perfectly  I haven�t overclocked it  The price was cheaper than what I have spent on amazon in the past  Great product no problems 
Purchased this to upgrade the RAM on a computer purchase  Worked without any problems  and PNY RAM comes with a warranty  so make sure you keep the packaging and receipt 
Easy to install  work s as expected for DDR4 RAM  Nice heat shield
This Corsair ram was priced good  Worked out well for the laptop I put it in as well  Would recommend for anyone needing an upgrade or replacement 
Great with the iPhone 6 and it gives out great sound
I wish it would pick up the Google Maps app instead of Apple Maps  It also skips radio stations I could pick up on my stock radio  That is the only reason it didn t get 5 stars 
Bought this radio for my son as he all his music is on his phone and ipod  Easy set up after geek squad installation  Son really enjoys it  Good radio for the price  JVC has great products  Would definitely recommend this to anyone 
Radio does everything I need it to  USB  AUX input  and Bluetooth  Has plenty of customization  sound wise  
This radio is awesome for the price  Bluetooth is great and every other setting is good too 
This unit is great for any Apple enthusiast and overall is a outstanding unit  The only downside is it requires a cable to connect to your iPhone  It would be great if it had wireless CarPlay 
Love the Bluetooth works good with my phone using my music Saved on it 
One of the best radio s on the market  great sound and looks great 
I was happy with my shopping experience at best buy and will shop there again
Great product for the price  I love that I can one easily connect my iPhone 
Radio offers lots of features  Bluetooth technology is awesome  Great color changing display that offers ability to have two different colrs at once 
I was looking for a new head unit for my car because I wanted something with more features  I mainly wanted the Bluetooth which my previous unit did not have  I m amazed at how well the Bluetooth works  I haven t had to reset or reconnect it yet  Overall this unit is great  The only downside is there is no CD Player but I never really listened to cds before I got this unit anyways  I would recommend this product to a friend  I don t regret my purchase 
I have a samsung S5 and it synced to it quickly and easily  It has a external microphone that sounds great even when driving 
This radio is great for the price  Bluetooth feature is a plus 
easy to setup and use  worked great during Hurricane Mathew
I enjoy the radio and I like the colors that flash the subwoofer is greatI like how it tells you the name of the song
We were looking specifically at Apple Car Play Radios  The Alpine was recommended by the installer at the Best Buy in Mesa on Signal Butte My wife loves her new car stereo  absolutely no complaints  works as advertised  Also  the installer at this Best Buy is five star 
Love that it s Bluetooth and the installation by geek squad of the radio came with a microphone for hands free calling  Also love that it can be used for Sirius xm
I love the radio features and compatibility with phone devices 
Excellent radio  Only wish that it was easier to navigate while driving 
Simple set up  better reception than earlier models
A Great radio with a great sound and easy to use  
Bought as a gift but after quick hook up works just as well as the factory satellite radio in my own car dealing with the xm radio reps is more difficult than hooking up and using this radio
gave it to my son as a gift  He loves it  Uses it all the time 
GOOD QUALITY GOOD PRICE GREAT RADIO EASY TO INSTALL 
Great pic sounds and quality service are outstanding
Great price and does everything that I need it to  All the bells and whistles and not complicated to operate 
Great radio  especially for someone who hates CDs and uses their phone for music  Simple menu navigation  Overall easy to operate 
Has more channels than the old one I had the one I had was from the late 90 s
I bought this for my classic car It works great  and I am considering purchasing one for my wife s car for the hands free calling 
I bought this for my parents  They needed it so they could move it between 2 vehicles  It was easy to set up and has proven a great asset  Worth the money 
I really like This radio got great reviews before buying I like the apps
This is a great radio  Display is easy to read and all functions are easy to use  Would highly recommend this radio  
Works beautifully  I would definitely buy it again 
Understanding my ratings 1 Star   Strongly discourage getting the product  There are absolutely no positive or helpful aspects in the product 2 Stars   Overall not recommended  Have some positive aspects but not good enough to be recommended 3 Stars   Workable product  It s not terrible  but not fantastic either 4 Stars   Fantastic  I love it  but there are a few things that could improve 5 Stars   Strongly recommended product  Hardly any flaws to the product and it s functions *If my opinion on this product changes while in use  I will update my review to reflect such changes Thanks   Regards
I ordered 2 sets and one speaker didn t work right so I returned a pair to Best buy and they ordered a new pair for me  Just test each speaker before you install them  good advice no matter what speakers you end up buying  There are so many options on the best buy website for in ceiling speakers  I chose these due to price and customer reviews and I am very happy with them  They have a good quality sound and are easy to install  I would definitely recommend these 
The cassette s provide great picture and sound  I love them 
I did a lot of research before buying these and am very pleased with them  There is no reason to spend 300 bucks for headphones when you can buy these for 70 like I did  they are EASILY worth double what they cost  The blutooth range is rated at 30 feet but that is an underatatement  I work in a machine shop and can leave my iPhone or iPad in my toolbox and walk behind a sheetmetal wall that is 50 feet away and they still dont skip  They only skip when I am behind that wall AND behind a machine  The only problem I had was the FIRST time I tried to pair them  I wasnt holding the button down long enough  beware of that and read the instructions better than I did and you will be fine 
Love these tapes  bummed they are discontinued now 
This is a great  smart bluetooth decice for my office  I can�t say enough about it 
I was very impressed with the quality and features of this backpack  It s customizable and fits a lot for the actual size of the backpack  Definitely would recommend 
Great for professional business environment  only wish it could pop out for use as tablet only 
I was grateful Best Buy had product in stock and the quality of the tapes are excellent 
I had if for a while now and I am not regretting the purchase
Love the quality sound that is produced from this  I use it all the time whether its just casually in my small apartment or whem im in the garage working on things 
The Sony xb30 speaker is way more bang for you buck  I compared it to the Beats Pill  and there was not question that the sound was better  I also listened to the JBL speaker and for the price of the Sony on sale  it was the better deal Pros  Loud and full of bass  Battery life last longer than most speakers even on full volume  Price is just right Water resistant Pair with other portable sony speakersCons  It does not charge with a USB cableIf your looking for a great speaker you will not regret this purchase  You will not break the bank with this one 
This product was great  Sound was amazing and customer care was on point 
I have not have had any problems or issues with this puter  It got great ratings works good
The sling box works well on my computer with the slingbox app  which is free   I was also able to watch TV using my samsung phone slingbox app for android   also free  I cast it onto my tv using the chromecast app on my phone  it was very simple  It has a great guide showing what is available to be watched on tv   hd channels filter  You can watch what is on your dvr  I haven t used this yet  I would suggest you have a separate dvr  or digital box to hook upto to so it doesn t hijack your main tv   I  e  if you are out of town and others are at your home watching your main tv you will be able to change the digital box channels it is plugged into  My main reason for purchase is to use at cottage and catch up on my dvr    you just need wifi to watch 
Great TV and great price  Purchased for bedroom   
Best gaming mouse I have had handsDown  Love the wired  wireless capability
Highly recommend this item  use it regularly at the gym 
I have a two HDMI TV and multiple devices that require a switch  The TV is mounted above a fireplace with limited access to components  The remote allows me to change to any device by just choosing an action  If u have the switch  make sure you get a remote control one  Remote is easy to set up an easy to use  Great purchase 
The Slingbox passes my home cable to all computers  portable devices and Amazon Fire TV over the internet  Anything you can watch on your cable anywhere you have internet  Super  does all it says it will  well 
What a sound  These speakers are so clear and the longer you play them the better they sound  Perfect for my lanai 
Beautiful Picture  Great value  Works well with prime tv and netflix 
Easy to set up and use with myharmony com software 
I have nothing bad to say about this item  its served the purpose  
My first weekend with the Slingbox and it is working very well  Easy setup overall  but selecting the right remote was a bit harder than usual as I am using the Slingbox with an Xbox 360 with Windows Media Center  Took some time and investigation  but I finally found the proper remote on J1 
Excellent product  I used it on a recent three week trip  Worked perfectly 
The remote works great  the only reason we wont give 5 stars is because there are times it will get out of wack when moving from watching TV to watching the Apple TV  very easy to manually correct but still it gets lost shifting from one request to another 
I am very happy with my purchase  I have been looking for this product for a long time  I bought the entire 5 1 for what I was going to pay for just the subwoofer  Free shipping and fast delivery were great 
I use a wireless internet provider  a lightning storm took my UPS and did some damage to my motherboard  This eliminates the ethernet hookup to my board and makes it a lot less prone to lightning damage It has plenty of speed for my use and has never let me down since I bought it 
The Slind Media Sling box M2 is a great product  Easy setup and operation
This is a great remote with lots of features  Easy to install and easy to use  Setting it up was quick and easy 
Very happy we were able to purchase this product The product works well with no difficulty 
Great Product  Very Satisfied  good battery life  good range  noise cancelling could be better 
I was looking for backpack like this for a very long time finally I found it  with this backpack I am very satisfied
Bought this for my husbands car  He loves it  Stock stereo stopped working and now he has bluetooth 
This is my first time purchasing a Samsung television  and I am extremely pleased with it  It is a perfect television for watching sporting events and entertaining company  If you are looking for a smart television for a low price and great quality I definitely recommend this Samsung 50 inch LED SmartTv When receiving this product the shipping was fast and was packaged well  The set up was a simple and quick process  It took me about ten minutes to get it all set up  The accessibility of this television is one of its best qualities  It easily connects to Wi Fi for the use of Netflix  YouTube  Hulu  and searching the web  It is also equipped with two HDMI outlets  which are very convenient  I found the smart television features to be quite easy to navigate It has come in extremely useful when having company over for parties  because it is great for watching and listening to music videos  The sound quality of the speakers is excellent  No need for expensive portable speakers we just listen to it off the television  The LED lighting makes the brightness and color fantastic for a great overall picture quality  The clear picture is wonderful for watching football games and hosting movie nights I believe the price is great for the value that you receive  Compared to most smart televisions this Samsung has excellent quality and is quite affordable  I would suggest this television for college students like myself who are looking for a nice television for a relatively low price  It is a perfect television for my roommates and me  and I can still afford my Ramen noodles The only negative comment I would have about this purchase is the television stand  It has a two leg base  so it does not seem as sturdy as what is shown in the advertisement  I saw this to only be a minor inconvenience that would not deter me from recommending this product  I would suggest using a wall mounting instead  With this being my first experience with Samsung  I will definitely be using their products in the future  I think this is a perfect television for young adults on a budget  The accessibility  quality  and price won this television a five star rating from me  Overall this was a great purchase  and I would highly recommend this product  It made a great addition to my living room 
The Logitech universal remote was a breeze to program with my 6 elements and is very easy to use and has great performance  Strongly recommend this universal control 
However  it would be nice if we can use it for TV sound output
No complaints about the product as far as how it works  Great signal  easy to use and set up  Unfortunately  there are ads with the web player which are very annoying 
Was pleasantly surprised to find that Best Buy s sale price on the hard drive was lower than many popular computer hardware retailers  These hard drives are great for a DIY home NAS build 
Good quality product for a reasonable price  I would recommend to family and friends
Great keyboard  I had thought the fingerprint scanner would be somewhat of a gimmick  but I use it every time I log into my Surface Pro 3  The backlit keyboard is also a great feature  A must have for your suface pro 
Great product and great service  I won t go anywhere else for audio needs
Great product  Somewhat sensitive 
Having the ability to watch your favorite shows from wherever you are is amazing  As long as you have an internet connection  you re good 
I bought it for my MacBook Pro  It is working great  Great price 
I can see the tv lineup from back home when I m away 
It really hits the beats well  One of the best bluetooth speakers I ve ever had  Also  the charge lasts a good length of time 
Ordered this wall mount unit online  Arrived a few days later  My electricians  who were wiring my room  installed the unit with ease  looks great  works great  The TV is secure and I can swivel the unit to make watching easier from very angle 
Set up was a breeze and it gives me peace of mind when I am away  I can feel comfortable leaving my pet knowing I can check in on him at any time  The app works great with my iphone as well 
Sling Box is a fantastic easy to implement product  really convenient 
The slingbox works as advertised  great picture  We had some problems setting up but the phone support line was terrific 
These tapes are great for my mini camcorder and are the only ones I use 
Works as advertised  Like being able to view my home tv channels and DVR when away  Setup was easy and it works on all my devices   cell phone  iPad  tv 
Sling medium boxes truly TV on the go really enjoy it and would recommend it to a friend and family
The product works as expected  but is really big compared to my thin MacBook  Wish it was smaller and not as noticeable 
From start up this remote has given me problems  I m not sure if is the products I am controlling or just the remote  Most times it switches inputs properly when pushing an activity from the remote  however sometimes it doesn t  I have all the sensors properly placed and have contacted support but can t seem to fix it  Another problem is scrolling through menus and tv shows on my hulu plus  It does not scroll properly  Many times it goes fast and won t stop or just doesn t respond  Rather annoying but am still happy that I don t need a bunch of remotes and that you hit one button and everything turns off 
This product is the best for the price more powerful n the sound comes out splendid paying less for great product
Great mount on dash  Easy to operate  But xm is Waaay to expensive
Won t replace a home stereo  but for the money  this is a great speaker  Decent full sound  great battery life  we turn off the lights   super easy Bluetooth pairing and a fair price make this highly recommended speaker 
The Midland it the top of the line weather radio  It is easy to use quick set up and worth the money for the safety 
Small and compact to bring anywhere and works great 
This speaker works great for my office  Sound is awesome 
Excellent product for this price point  Use it with my iPad 3  Connected right away 
Great Sound would highly recommend it
For the price  you get great sound from these small speakers  Good for both a small and normal sized room 
Great quality TV looks great in our reception lobby
Have had these for a couple of years now and they ve been great  Really good speakers for such a low price 
I bought the adapter since the wireless usb adapter our computer came with was not able to connect to our modem due to the distance  There were other wireless adapters more expensive  but I chose to go with this one and see how it worked  So far it s been working perfectly  Our computer does not have a CD port  so we had to download it  The process was a bit tedious   having to connect the new tower to our other desktop and run the ethernet cable from the bedroom to it  Once we did that the process was smooth  and we were able to move the tower back and connect the adapter with ease 
Purchased and received within one week  Purchased to replace television recent purchased that had to be returned for sound issues  Easy to set up  Picture is great  Sound is good  Very pleased overall 
Remote was easy to set up and worked exactly as designed  I did need some help with the technical department in setting up the sequence of when the TV  Cable box  blue ray  etc came on  Tech was very knowledgeable and walked me thru the issue and the fix  Very happy
Overall I would give this product a 4 out of 5 stars 
I am impressed with how fast that tablet is being that I did not splurge for the fastest processor or highest memory  I needed a tablet for school and it has surpassed my expectations so far 
Love my speaker  Its crisp and clear and perfect for those summer nights outside
Great product for security and making the surface pro more resilliant
i used it while on a business trip and while at a friends  works great  easy controls     the only caveat is you need fast internet if not it lags a lot and is very frustrating 
We bought this TV mount for our 70 inch TV  It is very sturdy and easy to move 
Product works as advertised  I originally used my iPhone  iPad to stream content to Apple TV to large screen TV  I quickly move to Fire TV which has Sling TV app to avoid the stream  Works great 
Great product except  It would work much better if it would pair up with other ultimate air speakers 
I already own one but I needed another one for my basement TV 
Great price for a radio with BT  For what I needed the radio sounds great and fit perfectly 
Great product  just what I needed  All pieces of power cord were included and packaged nicely  Shipped quick over the holidays and didn t have to pay any expedited shipping either 
Easy to use with good features New model has easy to see controls and features  works well with indoor dock and in the car
Samsung TVs don t disappoint  Great quality picture and sound 
I thought this was going to be a problem but I was so wrong   It was little intimidating but in the end it was relatively easy to install and my computer is now running fast   I recommend this to anyone who is not computer savoy  
Love this keyboard   backlit keys are great and the fingerprint ID works great   no problems so far  
I have a Netgear router and recently bought my son a gaming computer that did not have WiFi  This worked perfectly  My other son got a different brand gaming computer two years ago and the integrated WiFi quit working  No problem  got another Nighthawk 
Bought this with another pair of speakers for my daily  Great product  Huge upgrade from my previous speakers 
Does everything I need it to do  I use it for school 
Except when you don t point it at the electronic item and it still goes through its cycle  Now you have to turn everything off  go through the process of finding the item  turn it back on and then off  then start he system all over again  Other than that      great remote 
Great product and easy to use but expensive for a remote 
Great product for the price I paid  nice range and fits easy over the ears but would have been better with an over the ear cup  Would like it to come with it s own charger and not just a charging cord  So far battery life seems to be Okay 
Great product  exactly what I needed  Needs some improvement with recognizing components but easy fix included for now
Great sound and doesn t take up a lot of space would recommend 
I really like the sound quality after replacing the factory head unit with the ilx 007  Easy operation and an app that helps you build your own custom sound settings for after market sound systems  I also kept my factory backup camera feature with it 
I was surprised by the sound of this unit  The bass is really good 
I�ve always used an Apple TV and this was my first smart tv  A little worried about having the programs I wanted and I was pleasantly surprised with their variety  I just wish they had the ability to push your phone screen to them
Love the material and how it can be detached whenever I want  especially when I want to appear to have a tablet  Fingerprint logs me in instantly  On a few occasions  the fingerprint is unresponsive but it does not happen often  Great product 
Love the quality and sound  the hands free calling feature is great 
Serves its purpose well  I enjoy it in my home office so much I ve bought one for my niece as a high school graduation gift  I use it with my Roku 3 
These headphones are great  After my Boyfriend got a pair of wireless Beats by Dre headphones I got sucked into the convenance of not being tied down by a cord  I couldn t bring myself to pay almost  300 for a pair like his  but found these  These headphones are great  and the sound quality is very close to that of the Beats  They are comfortable  I wear them for hours at a time  and have multiple cartilage piercings  and have no problems  My only complaint is that some of the plastic that helps hold the head phones open  broke about 2 months after I got them  but this does not significantly impair the use of the product  I have had the headphones for 2 years now and they still work great  I ussually have to charge them once a week  I probably use them about 18 hours a week 
This is one of the best wireless adapters I�ve ever used 
Works great for watching Football when you are away from home 
Controls just about anything  Remote is fluid  easy to setup  easy to make selections and use  great screen and function  No lag  looks great  feels great 
Currently running on 32 GB of RAM by using this product on my PC and if anything to attach  is that I have no problems so far  Been running the PC for the past 2 months 
Device works perfectly just plug and play  Item is a little bulky 
did exactly what I was looking for   allowed me to watch TV remotey
Does everything I needed it to do  Easily programmed  Does away with multiple remotes  Turns on everything with one push of the button and controls each individual product when needed 
Easy setup  Up and running in less than 10 minutes  Already own one Slingbox that I have hooked up to DirecTV  Bought a second one for another part of the house to use with my cable connection  Now when I travel the Slingplayer app allows me to choose between Slingboxes 
Easy to install and works like a charm  when the TV is not in use the TV can be pushed fairly flush to the wall 
Easy to install  easy to setup and easy to use      as advertised
Easy to set up and worked as it was supposed to  Truly plug and play
Easy to set up  Worked the first time  All of my devices were available on line
Easy to take out of box  set to my phones Bluetooth and listen to my easy  Very easy  sleek  stylish  obviously could have bought a bigger better one  but this does the job and sounds better than jbl or beats 
Encourage to purchase this item  I can watch exactly what I want with no troubles at all 
Everywhere I go I have access to internet YES  This is a wonderful product  I m on the go all of the time and this is so convenient to be able to travel without not having internet as well as not losing Wi Fi  I am so happy that I discovered this product  I have shared this information with friends and family

I bought a smaller spec ed surface pro for meetings and am glad I bought there keyboard with finger print scanner  It works great  and has a great feel 
I bought these for my grandson as I have bought many other brands that failed  This by far  has been the most reliable and quality 
I bought this portable charger for when I went to game 7 of the stanley cup finals between the washington capitals and the new york rangers  I knew that I was going to a great experience and would be taking plenty of pictures with my samsung galaxy s6 as well as videos  and that my battery would be drained fairly quickly by doing so  Considering the game went into overtime and I had enough juice to get home I was very pleased with the result of this battery charger  Also portability is excellent 
I can watch my tv from anywhere  Much better then the M1 
I have a 70  Sony mounted in this baby and am very impressed with the stability  The full motion feature is excellent as it allows me to watch the monster from any direction 
I have been using sony portables for years and they are great and this is the new design and best model to get 
I love the Roku  I can now watch Netflix in my bedroom while my husband is hogging the living room tv watching his sports  
I love this product I can watch TV anywhere I go for free all because I have table at home 
I previously owned the Solo version of slingbox for over 6 years but wanted hd broadcast on my big tv at my shop so i got the M2 slingbox and it is super easy to install just download and install software and withing a few minutes i was up and running the picture looks amazing in hd when i sling to my tv at my shop using a Roku   
I travel alot this so is the perfect product  Easy set up and I can program and watch any thing I have on my DVR and also watch live TV from any device  There was no app fees either  The Best
If your looking for amazing headphones then look no more  Do yourself a favor and just do it 
Installed myself    Sounds great
It exceeds all what it says it ll do and more  You won t be disappointed 
Love the keyboard  I love the fact that you can flip the keyboard with the keys down when you don t want to use them
Must buy if you travel alot good picture quality not too expensive
My husband and I were due for a new Slingbox  We purchased this after all the positive reviews  Great product 
my son loves his new product  thank you very much 
Overall a great receiver  Had issues with the app but an email to alpine support will get you squared away 
Overall I am very pleased with the clean aesthetics of this unit  the ease of installation  especially for my first head unit install   and the functionality  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked for my opinion 
Product does its job works well and I was able to install it all by myself  Just make sure to use the studs in the wall as the mount is full motion and heavy itself 
purchased last month to use with IPAD and IPhone was absolutely amazed at the quality of the product consdering I paid under  70 definitely worth every penny  You will not be disappointed 
Solid product  Comes with everything you need and is very easy to hook up and use
The product was easy to install  It works great for viewing TV on any device 
The surface pro type cover with fingerprint ID is a must have for your surface pro  Great Accessory 
these are amazing and i would recommend to anyone and everyone

This is a great product and it met or exceeded all my expectations
This is a great product would definitely recommend two friends
This is a very nice product  Highly recommend it for anyone
This is one amazing headphone with great bass and extended response  I have done professional recordings in the past and prefer these to even some great Sony and Grado headphones

This Slingbox M2 has worked perfectly  I use it so that I can watch cable tv in my vacation home without needing to pay a second cable bill 
This speaker is excellent  The sound is what is expected 
This was easy to install and program  I put it a boat with a water proof box  I like remote 
Though not designed specifically for gaming  it handles it well  connects easily the first time and flawlessly every other time with no issues 
Use with Roku Streaming Stick and SlingPlayer App to watch on TV without having to rent another cable box  Is also great to be able to stream and watch TV on phone or tablet when away from home 
Very good sounding speaker and long life battery     
Was easy to setup and install  Step by step instructions  Worked very well on a recent vacation 
We love this product  I bought a Samsung TV floor model and it was missing remote  I was told that this remote would work like the Samsung remote and let me tell you it is the best  Highly recommend it

Like The adjustability of this product  I had a fixed unit before 
For the price  it s a pretty loud bass  great for living room  also can link multiple bass as well  Water resistant  nice to the touch  Well build 
Replaced some RAM that was causing failed boot ups  Works flawlessly and my machine has been brought back to life  Only downside is there are no XMP profiles for easy overclocks and the timings are somewhat loose  But for most users they will never care nor notice Would recommend as a cheap RAM option which can be grabbed locally 
I actually listened to all of the speakers on display before selecting this one  The Sony had the sound I preferred especially with the extra bass option turned on This was so simple and easy to connect to my iPod    right out of the box  There are also apps you can download to change the light patterns  These range from mellow settings to the default which operates with the music  Another bonus was the option to connect more Sony speakers to this one  offering a fantastic surround sound for the home Between us  we have an Altec  and a couple of JBLs  and I much prefer the sound of this one 
Replaced an old Sony 5 1 set and for the price these speakers are great  Solid construction and great sound 
Purchased for myself to replace an older one  Right size for the bedroom  Picture is clear and it�s a smart tv so I can watch all my old shows and many new ones 
Purchased this as a replacement for the smaller size which was stolen  Excellent sound  easy to use  sync with Bluetooth 
I think it s awesome to find this product for a reasonable price rather than pay too much for beats or Bose  I try those too and it s a minor difference in sound and I can live with it  I use them on my last fly and they work so good  You don t lose the signal on the plain  I was in second raw and went all the way dawn to the wc at the end of the plain and they work perfect  If you want to be snobby get the beats or Bose  But if you want to use that money in other gadgets its much better  The batterie last forever I use them round trip about 6 hours each and batterie last  I m so happy with this product 
Full HD TV smart television at a great price  Door buster price was a no brainer purchase 
looking for a different brand and price but ran into this particular product with a better price and overall value 
This is a great gaming machine for the specs that comes with it  You ll have to upgrade the video card to play the more demanding games at high settings  My only complaint is that Dell seems to be leaning toward the dvd drives that have the trays that pop out  like the laptop drives  instead of the powered trays that fully open and close  But over all  it s a good buy
Miss the connection for our Wii  Will have to purchase a connector  Only 1 HDMI connection 
Love BestBuy Alway buy all my products here always great prices
great memory works well  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to upgrade
I bought a pair of these beauties to expand the RAM in my custom built PC  The lights are cool  They match all your fans  etc and motherboards that support LED lighting 
it s really one you will never regret buying  it feels so nice in my car
I have a fairly small room downstairs and this system is perfect for the size 
Great price for off the shelf product available without having to wait for mail order delivery 
I bought this remote based on a sale price  and I wanted to reduce the remotes cluttering my desk  It was easy to program but I am still learning how to use itMy cable provider was not provided in the Program List so I had to add my favorite channels manually and upload the icons myself   As a surprise bonus I was able to load a fun Icon  The Icon I chose for CNN is  CNN FAKE News  That alone was worth the price of the Remote
I just needed a basic system for my man cave room in the basement  This is a very good system for the price 
It was easy to setup  The variety of ways to use a Smart TV makes electronic life fun and enjoyable 
Tv works great for space that I have  Great price for 40� tv
Purchased for my security cameras and is very quiet and works very well with the cameras  Good buy 
Very stylish in a compact package  Loving it  Recommend
EU Megablast is a very unique BT speaker with Alexa assistant  This device is WELL BUILT  heavy  and rugged  Pros  very clear soundhuge battery powervery good range for wifi and BT connectivity  perfect for backyard and garage work water proof  pool proof  shock proof Alexa assistant  need I say more? Cons  as of now it supports only a limited music apps  no Spotify    connecting to smart home devices is not so easy  had hard time connecting the megablast with my Phillips Hue home kits   Bass on this device could be better for this price  the base that lets you dock the device while at home is an option at  40 and it comes in white color only at the end I know for a fact that this device will last for years and survive a lot of parties   camping  etc  the apps and Alexa support will hopefully get better with time 
I have used other bluetooth speakers from other companies and they sounded great but this is the best one I have used so far  It has two passive radiators for more bass  The battery life is amazing at around 20 hours as tested with sound around 40% 60% depending on the time and etc  The one thing I dislike about this speaker it doesn t charge with micro USB and needs the cable that came with the device  This does have a USB male connector to charge your device though  I also like that it is water resistant so I don t have to worry about splashing it accidentally or etc as well  Overall I love the sound of this speaker and it is a fun sounding speaker so it isn t neutral so don t expect it to be 
We needed a small bluetooth speaker for our pontoon boat because the built in stereo was broken and I wanted something that was portable for other uses  I tested out several at the store and loved the size and especially the shape of this model  It was a little more expensive than what I had wanted to pay and actually bought another one at Costco that was on sale to compare  We ended up taking the less expensive one back    you get what you pay for   The sound quality on this little thing is excellent  It was very easy to sync with my cell phone and easy to carry  Once we had it on the boat it sounded great  Love the extra bass boost and especially the light show  which you can control from the app    it looks really cool on the lake at night  You can also use it as a bluetooth speaker for your cell phone and take calls 
I have been completely blown away by the performance of this new Megablast portable speaker by Ultimate Ears  I currently own a Boom speaker  which is a previous generation of portable speaker from Ultimate Ears  and this Megablast speaker is a vast improvement in every way  The Megablast looks fairly similar in style to the Boom  with the same cylindrical shape and rubbery feel to the buttons  It is much larger than the Boom  It is advertised as waterproof and this held true when it was tested in a bathtub  This makes it great for outdoor situations  especially for the pool  boat  or camping  The Megablast has far field voice recognition  reacting to my voice commands from very far away  inside and outside  It can connect either via Wi Fi or Bluetooth  It is compatible with Alexa Voice which allows it respond to all of the typical Alexa questions and commands  The speaker currently works with Amazon Music  iHeartRadio  TuneIn  through the Alexa App   Via Bluetooth  you can connect to your phone and play music from the various music services that are out there  There is a free Ultimate Ears app that will need to be downloaded to your phone which walks the user through connecting the speaker and logging in to Amazon and other music services  The speaker does come with a D ring  Micro USB cord  and power adapter  I also obtained the Ultimate Ears Power Up charging dock which works nicely with the speaker  The Power Up charging dock works with both Megablast and Blast speakers  but not the previous generation of speakers like the Boom  For me  a single charge lasted about fifteen hours  Now about the sound  it is amazing and comes out in all directions  Compared to my old Boom  music sounds more full and rich  even at loud volume levels  The improvement in the bass is the most noticeable  Music has real weight to it that you just don t hear with other portable speakers thanks to the improved bass drivers  The highs  the mid range  and the lows just sound so good  I have really enjoyed using the Megablast  It is easy to use  has quality sound  and allows me to use Alexa  If you are looking for a quality portable speaker  I highly recommend the Ultimate Ears Megablast 
I use this outside on my patio and it sounds fantastic  The lights are pretty cool when it gets as it dark too
This is an excellent speaker with a number of useful features  Great build quality and amazing sound from such a small footprint 
This speaker is great if your looking for something poolside or just outdoors  It s size is perfect
Since we do a lot of traveling and don t always have computer access needed a way to receive internet service for our phones and laptops  This portable hotspot is ideal and works great 
Great portable charger from Samsung  it slim  light and it chargers fast 
Ordered this for my nephew  it s exactly what he wanted and works as he expected  Best Buy even honored a price match 
This product work very well  It charge the phone very well
is a good product for recharged my celphones when am i travel
Plenty of memory to handle large projects and fast enough to keep them from being a chore  A good multi user computer 
Great Plate for projector mount  very easy to install
Works well with the asrock 350 gaming atx MB  Super smooth and runs everything i need 
Visually great  but sound is mediocre  This seems par for the course with most flat screen tvs  We have a larger Samsung with same issue  Both high quality image and lots of great features but poor sound  Bought a samsung sound bar for the larger one and that helps  but mfgs just plain need to up the ante in terms of sound 
Arrived with a pedestal base  different from the photos online   Much better solution to stability for me Huge VERY sharp picture 
Bought a Insigna 40  1080p  Awesome picture  Would defenitly recommend  
It s a low end TV and the wifi is sometimes glitchy if you re after the smart part of it  The UI is really slow as well  I bought it as a TV for the home office  for that purpose it does just fine 
We need to replace a tv with a smaller screen The Samsung had addition features above what we were shopping for and the sale price was lower than we were expecting It was extremely easy to set up and functions are easy to use
bought this for my son for Christmas for his room  He loves it  The picture is great  It s very crisp  Perfect size 
TV has a great picture and easy functionality  This is particularly true given the price point and size  Samsung makes a great product and this is no exception
Great picture and apps  It als connects to our samsung devices directly for streaming pictures and other content 
Great picture   well packaged and have had no problems setting it up  Revamped original entertainment center and is a perfect fit 
Have several Samsung TV s already and always satisfied with the quality and ease of use  This one was just as easy  It was a gift for Mom   a huge improvement from her old 24  picture tube
Bought this to replace one which had been hit by lightning  Loved the last one and love this one as well  Better picture quality than an older Sony  Picture is so clear you can see the details 
For the price all around love Samsung led  smart tv  Wi Fi  Quality 5 star
Great resolution  best quality for the money  Good value
Love Samsung  This tv just didn t work well with Netflix  Overall love it
This new tv was very user friendly to connect to my receiverAnd the quality is exceptional
This is just what I needed  Works well  I take it everywhere with me my kids love it especially when I m traveling 
Easy to use  blue tooth connection for headset and cell phones  Makes life easy
I love this product  Our puppy is alone for a portion of the day and having the calm mind knowing we can talk to her to calm her  It also gives very little lag  The only thing I m not a fan of is how loud the fan is within the app  Other than that I have recommended this product to everyone  Great price and quality for its price 
I was looking for a pair of ceiling speakers for our new kitchen addition to be used with a SONOS system  The powered SONOS cube has 55 watts    per channel and it is more than enough power to make these speakers sound good I was afraid that if I only went with a 5 1  4 or 6 1  2 inch woofer  I d be disappointed with the fullness and bass output  So I knew I had to buy a pair of 8 inch woofers to satisfy my high standard for sound quality  I was also slightly afraid that for under  200  these speakers wouldn t sound as good as some higher priced models I am happy to report that these speakers ROCK   They have good full sound and good bass output  for 8 inch speakers   They sound awesome and I have no complaints at all  The sound they produce is equal to  if not better  than many more expensive models 
This is one of the best bluetooth headphone I ever own  Sound quality is good and the best thing the battery last for a longer period of time at single charge 
I was recently upgrading my gaming PC to a AMd Ryzen 5 and new motherboard and failed to remember to also acquire new RAM for the motherboard  I was going from DDR4 to DDR5  so was putting everything back together and realized my mistake  Hopped on Bestbuy com and found these in stock and bought online to pick up in store  I�m normally a Corsair only guy when it comes to RAM and bought these because I was in a pinch but they have performed remarkably well  The fact that they are 8gb means I can eventually expand to 32gb of RAM if I want to run a server off my desktop  which is cool  Overall great product 
Love this remote and have recommended it to family and friends  Definitely does the trick and now only have one remote to use for multiple devices 
We bought these speakers to replace the broken factory speakers in a Chevy truck and the sound clarity was much better than anticipated  They are definitely worth the money and easy to install  I would definitely consider buying any Alpine products again in the future 
Bought this for my wife�s late 2012 MacBook  Installed after I upgraded her Mac to a SSD and makes this laptop brand new and blazing fast   
These headphones hit all the check marks of my little man s have to list  All came at a great price too
When I ve purchased headphones in the past  Bose has been my brand of choice  Once I put these headphones on at Best Buy  I was sold  These head phones are very sturdy  with exceptional sound quality  I still love the Bose brand  but JBL put out a great pair of headphones 
Was on the market for some good headphones  Came across these and tested them out  Very nice pair of headphones compared to others in price range  Good build quality and comfortable  Decent bass and clear highs  Best feature is the built in mic  Works very well  I can listen to my music while working out and if I get a call  I can answer it without even touching my phone removing my headphones  Battery life is good as well 
Biggest con is no rain hood  I should have choose better in that regard  But plenty of room and everything is secure 
Good sound quality  I wish it would go louder than it does  Great battery life 
I was given a free unit in exchange for an unbiased review Honestly  I m not sure what s turned out to be better for our family regarding the Ultimate Ears    MEGABLAST  speaker    the fact that the audio is quite room filling or the Amazon Alexa functionality that s built in Regarding the speaker  per se  for the size  portability and quality of this device  you really can t go wrong    Logitech bought Ultimate Ears some years ago  so that speaks to the overall culture  It has very good lows  mids and highs for a Bluetooth speaker  turning it all the way up never completely pegged any of the sound frequencies like is possible with lower quality devices  While we haven t done it yet  we think this might be a great speaker for outdoor movie nights  one of the reasons why we went after the unit to test it  Connectivity was a breeze through the Ultimate Ears app in terms of setup  This was also our family s first foray into Amazon Alexa territory  and the device certainly doesn t disappoint  Asking simple commands    or  skills   as is Amazon parlance    does allow for Alexa to retrieve data and perform simple commands with Internet access  the only caveat with Amazon Alexa is that it will respond anytime anyone says   Hey  Alexa   even if it s over TV    And since it s software upgradable via firmware  future integrations continue to come down the pike We re definitely looking forward to many years  worth of usage from this device  both inside and outside of the house 
Everything anyone would want at great price point 
This Is a great product  I own a pair of beats and decided to get this product after seeing the reviews  You will not be disappointed with this product  Great sound
These are great compared to factory  Easy to install  Will be buying these again 
Installed 4 AW 6500 speakers at our pool pavilion  Great sound   clear details  no subwoofer needed  I love bose products but these were better than bose 251 
I purchased these speakers for my backyard patio  I had previously purchased an interior surround system from the same manufacturer and was very pleased with their performance After hearing the sound from these speakers  I m very happy with my purchase  I ll spending a lot of time in the pool this summer enjoying listening to my music  It sounds great 
These were recommended by a sales guy and they are great  I use them outside at the pool area 
Bought this to have on our back patio for when we entertain  I read a review stating that it was a very powerful speaker that eliminated the need for multiple speakers  My wife was weary because she wanted to listen to music when she works on the flower beds  I installed it and both of us were amazed  I haven t even turned it up more than half way and it fills our backyard with great sound  It puts out a good range with clear tones  When driven by the right receiver  I m using the Yamaha RX V671  this speaker ROCKS 
Purchased as didn t want to pay a 2nd cable bill at new cottage  Works great as can beam existing cable services over Internet and play on another tv with the help of an assist like Roku  Also works nicely on IPad if wanting to watch cable line up and not at home
Great little backpack  Well made  I carry my dslr as well as both my gopros  Still have room for extra lens and batteries  Nice design too  Favorite part is the fact that the zipper is on the inside for security and safety 
These head phones are bluetooth wireless  noise reduction  The were easy to partner with my Ipads  In order to use it on multiple devices the wireless has to be disconnect on all the other devices but the one partnered  It has a long wireless use time before requiring recharging Issue  the headband for some reason puts an uncomfortable amount of pressure at the top of the head where the band rests on the head  I have experienced inner ear pain from the ear pads with prolonged use  more than two three hours at a time   I guess the seal of the ear pads creates pressure on the ear  Suggest limiting duration of wear to prevent discomfort on the inner ear and where the headband makes contact with the head  Otherwise the product is great when competing devices are on and you want to hear your program 
Purchased for the noise cancelling feature  Works great 
These headphones are great  I do a lot of airport travel and the noise reduction is phenomenal The clarity on music and calls is fantastic  I guess the only complaint is the size of them but then again with the awesome sound quality    who cares 
This new fingerprint lock keyboard is one of the main selling points or the surface pro four for me 
Bought these to upgrade a Windows Storage Server at work    Worked great   
Used hard drive in my synology nas box and was satisfied with its performance 
I purchased 2 of these recently to replace 2 1TB WD Green drives that had over 9 Years of actual up time on them  I already had 2 of these 2TB Red drives in my home server set up as RAID 1 Mirror and I couldn t be happier  No they are not performance drives  No you shouldn t put them in your primary PC for playing games and booting from  but if you are looking for good long term storage    file server drives then these work great 
This product came on time as I ordered it  It was extremely easy to install  It works just as it is described  I loved the first one so much  I went back and bought another one 
pros Great music quality even at high volume Excellent for parties  especially with led colors which goes with music so wellBluetooth connectivity works very wellIf you party at home then this is a great syatemCons It s not actually a con of it  with so much power size of the system will be little bigger  so it is  It s around 49  length and 12  wide
Pros  Easy to use and setup  It is very user friendly  Pretty much intuitive Cons  price 
This Harmony remote is awesome  It controls all your devices  is easy to setup and use and the battery lasts quite a long time 
I took 5 devices and set them up for the correct sequence  It works exactly as needed  If you have a Samsung TV and need to change the sources back and forth across multiple HDMI Sources  you may need to add a delay for the TV source to recognize the device you are using like a DVD player to send the signal or the TV source  I believe this is a Samsung TV limitation not a Logitech Remote limitation 
Overall a great remote  Only drawback I have seen is that some of the functions are now handled through the screen which makes them a little less easy to use  Everything else works great 
Great battery life  Responsive and quick  I ve been looking around for a good wireless mouse  This is it  Goes great with my Logitech G810 keyboard 
I love this mouse  Spring for the wireless version 
First gaming mouse and was recommended Logitech  Awesome color changes  customizable dpi  and software you can download for it to customize your gaming settings  Must buy for the price
Not really a big fan of RGB but customizability for color coordination or preference is not a bad thing  My main reasons of buying this mouse are the responsiveness  weight  size  DPI  rechargeability  and the fact thats its wireless  The overall design is simple  didn t need unnecessary button as I don t play MMOs  A slight Con is the need for a textured surface for the type of sensor to properly work  ie a mouse pad  It will not work on glass surfaces 
Great mouse for gaming and productivity  Able to adjust weight  Love this product and would highly recommend it 
Works well no issues only complaint is that you cant adjust brightness unless you set the color setting to breath and then you can dim the brightness I had to due to my laptop being an Alienware and wanting the brightness to match my laptop and color very good mouse company never had any issues 
I bought this mouse for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it  Before he had a razor mouse and he says that this one is the best one he s had 
This one of the best wireless mice you can get  It s comfortable  fast  precise and has a button for you to change your speed on the fly  You can customize the color of the lights and the mouse last quite a while  The only con of the mouse is that it doesn t have more buttons  However the G903 has more buttons and heftier price 
Although I prefer the Logitech G Pro for gaming  this mouse is a better all rounder due to its ergonomics  smoother scroll wheel and wireless 
Got a great deal on the mouse  The shape is perfect for my hands 
Got on sale and was well worth it  Accurate and long lasting charging 
Great mouse  just the right weight  and felt nice when using
I love this mouse just enough settings to tune it in the way I like  It s faster and more responsive than I expected it to be  The option to use with it without a cable is awesome too 
I was looking for a wireless solution and this mouse works fantastic  You can also charge it and use it at the same time for a more wired solution  Overall its great lots of customizable features
I m not a hardcore gamer so I can t comment on how it is for that  What I can say is that is really comfortable to use  the buttons have satisfying click to it and it looks slick and minimal even with the RGB lights  Battery life is not great but that s because of the high quality sensor it has 
The design if the mouse makes so easy to use  Grandson loves it 
The G403 mouse works great and looks cool  The rechargeable battery last long enough and is easy to recharge 
This is a great mouse for the price  got it on sale  
This is my daily driver and it is the best mouse I have ever owned 
This is my second Logitech mouse  I had the Proteus spectrum previously  and loved it  but wanted something wireless  Although the top button only seems to work half the time  it s a small price to pay for such a nice looking  great working mouse  I would definitely suggest this mouse if you re in the market for a wireless mouse  The battery does last longer than I can play  which is a huuuuuge plus 
This mouse is phenomenal  has a beastly sensor inside  ergonomics are great  has non slip texture on the sides  adjustable dpi increments of 50  easy software  come with additional weight if heavy mice are your thing  braided cord  almost 24 hours play time on a charge  can also charge while you play or just play wired  Cons  LED doesn t produce a true white basically a sky blue  doesn t come with Logitech s infamous infinity scroll wheel    Overall a great mouse I have decent size hands  about 8     20cm or so long and this mouse fits just perfect  i tend to palm or finger tip my mice  I don t see this mouse being as comfortable for a clap grip style though
We were deciding between flat mount for lower cost and this   glad we went with it  we love it for our 65  plasma TV 
This mount worked very well for me when I used a peerless adjustable column to connect to it  Both the ceiling plate mount and the adjustable column were used to help support a projector that was installed in my home theater room 
Bought this mount for my 60  flat screen and it works fantastic    It can tilt left to right  up and down and pull out from the wall for better viewing  It was easy to install and best purchase yet 
It s really good expensive but worth it I find it very nice when I m eating and able to move my tv
I mounted a Samsung 59 inch plasma using this mount  The mount is rock solid  and the finishing touches are great  I have installed a different plasma mount in another room a year ago  and the difference in quality is stark  This has beautiful finish  is very thin  very adjustable and has nice finishing touches  like a cover plate to hide the screws from mounting on the wall  Just beware that since this is a very thin mount  the power receptacle etc has to be recessed in the wall otherwise you will not be able to push the tv flush against the wall  I had also ordered a SANUS receptacle to go with this  but am returning it as the depth of the receptacle did not fit my wall depth 
This mount works great to hold TV above fireplace mantle  Easy installation with included template 
The srs zx7 is a great not so little speaker  functionality and sound stage is awesome  The clarity and quality are amazing  it s ease in pairing and multi room support is a pleasant surprise 
I love having a Jetpack  It increased my connection speed and has worked great when ever I leave home 
Everything on this machine works great    would double RAM to 32 for smoother streaming    though 16 works pretty good 
Needed a quality midsize TV  and this worked out perfectly 
Only negative is a lack of comfort after 20 minutes
Great mice  at first it felt to big  but the reason is being I had a smaller and flatter mouse before  this one fits nice and comfortable on hand  has inactivity auto off and auto on after movement  Very good quality knowing I accidently dropped it from 5 ft to the floor it did not even leave a scratch and still worked well  I was in shock 
What a difference a brand makes  I previously previously brought PNY memory from a different store  Put Both memory modules in my MacBook  mid 2010   the computer did not boot up  After several tests including putting the original memory back in  it was clear that PNY memory modules were defective  After returning them to the store and getting my money back  I decided to try out the Corsair Memory as it was recommended by a friend  I after looking at several other sites for this memory I ended up getting it from Wallmart com using the site to store option   Unsurprisingly Walmart had the best price   The memory arrived to the store 2 days before promised date      This despite Hurricane Sandy hitting the Northeast last week  After installing this memory my MacBook booted right up  No problems  My computer boots up and runs quicker  Programs load faster  What a difference upgrading the memory from 2GB to 8GB  I am a satisfied customer  I highly recommend Corsair Memory  especially if you own a MAC  Corsair memory is designed and tested to work in MACs  Own a MAC get Corsair memory  You ll not be disappointed 
Used these in my new gaming computer  and haven t had a problem yet 
Bought 2 of these while on sale  Great value for the money 
Installed this in my MacBook Pro with ease  Works great  
No xmp needed defaults at 2400 and looks good on my rampage v edition 10   
Looked the ease and design of these memory cards  I was able to replace my old ones and use the laptop right away 
Decent ram stick for beginners who build their own computers
I purchased 4 sticks of this ram and I am really happy with the results
I purchased this memory for my new HP slimline and am very satisfied  I have had no problems and the memory is very fast 
Memory works great no problems Installed on a new build
My computer wasn t turning on  I got this RAM and it fired right up  Good DDR4 memory 
The Slingbox M2 was relatively easy to set up The only drawback was the difficulty placing IR reader to ensure control of the box and I am only able to view the guide up to channel 100  I am able to view channels above 100 by pressing the numbers on the remote in the app  Once adjusted appropriately  it s not much of a problem The picture quality is amazing on the phone  but on the Roku 3 it sometimes has the pixelating view watching sports  Overall great investment  allowing you to watch your local channels whenever you re away from home 
Hooked up to my iPhone there isn t anything that this media player can t do  CarPlay is awesome 
This is a great unit  I like controlling Pandora from the deck via Bluetooth  The mic it comes with for voice commands  calls and voice to text works really well  USB is a little picky on which drives it accepts  Wouldnt take a Toshiba 8g but did take a 32g PNY  Easy controls and looks nice too 
Great sound  Details are very slimming and minimalistic  Looks great and sounds phenomenal 
Purchased this about a month ago for my 2007 Malibu  It has done everything as expected this far Bluetooth function makes for a much more enjoyable boat outing since you no longer have to worry about all of the cords all over the place while controlling the radio with the Sony remote unit that comes with the product  Would Recommend to my close friends and family
This computer was purchased to work on some light video editing and blog posting    working very well  Had some trouble with the Intel wireless adapter but a firmware update seems to have fixed that 
   XPS is a very good desktop tower that allows a good experience 
The speakers I purchased were a great price and sound amazing  I have a lot of people ask me if I have a subwoofer in my car and I am happy to say I do not  The speakers pack that much punch and keep me jammin  on my commute to work 
I purchased these speakers along with a receiver and the professional install  The speakers are great for the money  A good basic speaker  Beware the install did not cover the speakers and I had to pony up another  80 or so dollars to get them installed 
Perfect selection for a guest bed and with the spectrum app there is no need for a cable box either
Bought this cover after prior experience with the standard type cover 4 s  They tend to get discolored with standard wear and tear  the signature type has so far stayed looking really well  The back of this keyboard is incredibly soft to the touch and the front is a bit more rigid  but otherwise nice to feel  I bought mainly to get a keyboard that matches the tablet s grey and this cover is excellent 
I love the TV but you cannot close apps completely  I get occasional glitches where the smart hub freezes and it just bothers me that I can�t close apps running in the background  Even after turning the TV off for hours  I will open the Netflix app and still see it on the original page I was on  And no  I do not have the �autorun� smart features on I would also love Bluetooth to be added already  It�s Smart  Come on  I want to listen with my headphones without buying separate parts 
No hdmi connections  but component picture was better than expected  What I disliked the most about the product is your satellite or cable box has to be on to view remotely  Does the job 
Great tv for kids room  Easy set up  great picture
Still not a Microsoft person  It it was easy to use 
It has a great sound system I can listen to through out the house  pool deck 
Bought this for my son and he loves it  It s very loud and has clear sound 
For its size it sounds surprizingly good  with deep bass and crisp highs 
Looked at Bose and a few other brands in the store and this was the best for the price 
Sounds was great  choose those over a Bose  Connecting was easy  but sometimes it didn t want to connect to galaxy phone
This is a great little speaker for the price  It is very loud and does have good bass  The sound can be a little higher because the bass is a bit overpowering but there is an equalizer that can change how the sound comes out  I did wish the battery was more accurate  It says 24 hours but they don t tell you that it s with the lights off  bass boost off and I m not sure at what volume it has to be to get that kind of battery life  But i would say realistically at about half volume with the lights and bass boost turned off you can get 12 to maybe 16 hours 
Great little speaker easy to hook up to the Alexa sounds great even comes with an exhilarate cable
Great speaker  love the ability to link 2x speakers together to make a stereo pair  I have them placed throughout my house as stereo replacements for rooms that don t need a full system 
I looked at many portable Bluetooth speakers  and found that this one was the best fit for my needs  Has really good sound and bass response 
I m glad I waited to come across this little speaker before purchasing one  I ve wanted a bluetooth speaker for a while and really like this little one with a great sound 
I m usually not a fan of little bluetooth speakers  but this one is a winner  The Sony XB40 is of course better  and the similar sized Bose are a bit clearer  but for the money  this Sony was the one for me  It definitely beat out the Beats  Altec  JBL  etc  You can download an app that control the speaker light display  but it s not that great  The sound is superb given the cost 
Speaker works great and has great sound  We subscribe to Google Music and use the casting feature daily  I d definitely buy it again 
The Sony speakers work a lot better than I expected 
Have been using this remote for about 3 weeks now  It was a replacement for an older Logitech remote that I had used for about 8 years and was getting a bit flakey  Programming it for about 6 devices  activities and favorites was not hard  The program was easy to follow  just know the make and model number of your devices before you start  The remote is smaller and fits my hand well  the touch screen may be a bit over sensitive is about the only down side to it that I could see 
overall  these are great little tapes great quality and reliability  easy to use 
This Micro system is great for small spaces and includes 1 Aux Inputfor Bluetooth receiver to expand it s use  Not extremely powerful  40W but does the trick for smaller areas  applications   
This great little light as feature keyboard really completes the surface  helping turn my tablet in to a computer  and it snaps in to place almost flawlessly with the use of magnets  just like plugging in the power cord  oh by the way it protects the screen while closed 
Love this little speaker  It s lightweight  has a long lasting battery  and great sound quality  My wife and I took it to the beach with us last week and enjoyed it emensely 
Best quality for the price  tried many others and this is the most comfortable   
These headphones are very light and comfortable to wear for several hours  though your ears might get a bit sweaty on hot days   It s easy to pair the bluetooth and it comes with its own audio cable if you forget to charge it or if you prefer wired headphones  The sound quality is great for music and phone calls  I wouldn t really wear these to work out  other than maybe running  because there isn t anything that holds them onto your ears  other than gravity  so they might slip off if you re bending over a lot  My biggest concern with these was maybe losing the proprietary charging cable  but when I ended up doing just that  I found replacements pretty quickly  both on amazon and their website 
I can only carry a limited amount of weight when I am out shooting so the Flipside 300 is the perfect size 
I have the first Boom and enjoyed the operation and sound of that speaker but wished it had more sound  When the Megablast was released I decided to get it  I am glad I did as this speaker is a large upgrade from the boom even though the boom was great  The setup is easy and the huge plus is it has Alexa  If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker  portable  long battery life and Alexa this is the speaker to get 
I really like this store they have amazing products 
Great kit and was easy to install in my truck  Nothing else was needed for the self install other than a few zip ties to hide the wires and clean up the install 
The keypad itself is excellent  But I need to issue a warning  Since I m using a corporate login  I can t use the finger print part  or at least have not yet figured out how to use it for my corporate login  
Couldn t pick a better keypad for the Surface Pro 
The best keyboard i ever used  So easy to handle  fingerprint sensor fast and accurate 
Great keyboard to go along with my SP4  key spacing is perfect and responsive 
I love how it snaps into place  Easy to use  Only needs a light touch 
The keyboard has a nice feel and room enough to get some serious writing done I have found  however  with Microsoft Hello  there s no need for a fingerprint reader  The Surface camera will recognize me before I can even use the fingerprint reader 
The keyboard feels very nice  The backlight is amazing when it is dark  The fingerprint scanner is a great added security measure on top of the face recognition or to use as an alternative  Would definitely recommend 
Bought this for my SP4 specifically for the fingerprint ID  The fingerprint ID works perfectly for turning on my SP4  though it has not worked as well with the True Key password manager so I reverted back to password for True Key  The typing experience on this keyboard is AMAZING  My PC keyboard now feels mushy by comparison  Wish this keyboard came in colors other than Onyx  black  
Connects easy to the Surface computer  Great product 
Keyboard works perfectly  no complaints  Nice touch to the keys  illumination is just right 
Like the review below mine  I purchased this specific type cover purely for its appearance  but I am glad I did  It looks amazing with my SP4 and works well too  It is backlit  which is my preference for keyboards  and is also fairly sturdy considering how thin and light it is  Typing on it is just like typing on a real laptop keyboard  which I like a lot  I am sure the other type covers are the same  but as I said  this one had the look I wanted and I didn t mind spending the extra money for it 
Love the fingerprint scan  Spent the e tea money for this only and I don t regret it  This feels like a full size keyboard  I d love it to have 10 key but know that s not really possible   
Love this keyboard and fingerprint scanner is a must have  Easy to type and my Surface Pro looks great just like having a paper notebook 
wonderful keyboard and i love the fingerprint unlock
This is a great feeling and easy to type on keyboard  The back lighting is nice with variable brightness levels or turn them off  The mouse pad is smooth  responsive and decently large  The added fingerprint scanner is a nice feature to sign into the Surface  it is accurate and you can add multiple fingerprints to use 
I like this products about color  layout for choosing to use 
My son loves the ability to simply sign into his new surface with a fingerprint 
Works perfectly with the surface and connect easily   
Goes very well with my Microsoft tablet and it has all the fetures I need 
It s perfect and I m so glad I bought it for my husband  He loves it and doesn t want anyone to touch nor use his laptop  We love shopping at Vest Buy for all our electronic and gaming system 
This is great for getting things done  when the on screen keyboard either obscures too much of the screen or you simply want the tactile feedback of an actual keyboard  I use keyboards for a living  so this was an easy switch and the fingerprint to unlock feature is just great  Highly recommend this product 
I purchased this keyboard cover to go with my Surface Pro 4  I am extremely happy with it  I can type as quickly on this cover as I could on my laptop s keyboard  The only question people should ask is whether the fingerprint sensor is worth the additional cost  I would say that it is  It is very accurate and fast  and I love the ability to connect it to the LastPass extension  With it  you can literally fill in complicated forms and passwords in  at the touch of your finger   To me  that is a small price to pay for the convenience  but others may disagree 
The keyboard is a great improvement over the previous model Keys are spaced out more  the track pad is larger and the fingerprint sensor is a nice touch  Most people won t need the fingerprint version is  30 more  so unless you need it get the cheaper version 
Nice solid keyboard  Button presses aren t too soft  Very easy to type on  Finger print scanner is great for logging in
The keyboard feels surprisingly good considering how thin it is  The keys have satisfying tactile response and don t feel rubbery  The build quality is excellent and though the type cover isn t as rigid as a normal keyboard  it doesn t feel as though it will bend or break  Overall it is an excellent product  My only complaint is that the fingerprint reader doesn t consistently read my finger  I almost always have to scan my finger 3 4 times before it will read  Thankfully the scanning process is very fast    but still  it leave something to be desired  This may be a software problem  hard to say  That said  I still give the product 4  5 stars 
Although I wasn t a raving fan of the surface pro  I did enjoy the keyboard  Great responsive tactile feedback and Touch ID worked like a charm 
Easy to use and able to act as a regular keyboard 
Easy to use for both home and work  Easier than the surface 2 
Finger print recognition is a cool feature but the latest Surface Pro 4 I bought has face recognition so all you have to do is look at the screen and it knows who you are  Save the  30 extra cost and use face recognition 
Great keyboard with fingerprint recognition which worked 99% of the time 
Great keyboard  Love the fingerprint recognition  
Great keyboard  Fingerprint reader is really quick and accurate 
I bought this keyboard and was surprised that it was compatible with the case I purchased from amazon  The camera login usually works before the fingerprint ID can get you logged in  but it is there when the camera doesn t work the first time  The keys have plenty of travel considering how thin the keyboard is  The trackpad works well also 
I especially like the fingerprint ID  as I think it s more secure than just a password  It s really great 
I like the fingerprint scan   The option was not built into the surface  Keyboard   Feels like it is well made 
I like this keyboard because w  fingerprint it work very well
I love my tablet and keyboard  Very pleased with this purchase 
I love this keyboard  thin and you can actually feel the keys with finger and not be guessing wich one you press
If you like the tablet  computer then this is a must Finger reader great
It s a great keyboard works fantastic never has a problem however if Do you have a surface pro four with facial recognition you don t need a fingerprint reader
I ve used other tablet keyboard that were extremely frustrating  This keyboard is great  A couple times I ve accidentally touched the mouse pad or something and it will flip me to a different screen but I can come right back so it s not too bad  Overall I love this keyboard and it doesn t slow me down 
Love that it easy connect to surface pro and fingerprint recognition is cool 
Love the fingerprint touch access
Love the new finger scan  Great feel and ease of use 
Loving my new keyboard for surface pro 4  The keys light up and the fingerprint scanner works great 
Perfect keyboard for the surface pro  I definitely recommend this
Stiff and supports typing on your lap  Backlight is nice  Keys are responsive  Finger id works really well 
The extra money for the fingerprint ID is well worth it  Eliminating the need for a password is not only convenient but a huge timesaver  The keys have a good feel  quiet and well spaced 
The keyboard is great would definitely recommend  Since the update for the surface takes away the camera aspect its good to have the fingerprint scanner ability 
the surface pro type cover with fingerprint ID has worked flawless with the surface pro 4  The fingerprint ID is a wonderful upgrade that makes it quick and easy to get the surface pro unlocked and ready 
This is a great keyboard and makes the Surface Pro 4 the right choice to switrhc from my mac without missing my mac 
This is a nice addition to the tablet  Easy to use and remove 
This is a very nice keyboard  the new fingerprint ID took some getting used to  but works nicely  Recommended 
This keyboard has a great feel and works really well  My one complaint is that you sometimes need to disconnect and reconnect it   the Surface doesn t always see it when it starts up  Otherwise  really great 
Very easy to use and love the way you don t have to charge it to use it   
When I heard that the Surface Pro 4 would have a keyboard that would work with the Surface Pro 3 I was intrigued  When I purchased this keyboard  I was impressed greatly  The keyboard has a better layout  and a better  feel   It seems to be a bit more accurate also  The fingerprint id feature is an added bonus Whether your are a Surface Pro 3 or 4 owner  this keyboard is well worth the price 
This Alpine is great bought it open box  Love the size of the screen it gave me a hard time at first connecting to my iPhone but once it did everything else was just simple to use if you have a ANDROID phone DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT OR DONT WAIST YOUR TIME TRYING TO BUY IT this unit is specially just for iPhone LOVE IT iPhone user you won t regret buying this
Much faster with the internet and multiple devices
Customer service is Great   Items are Great  Best Buy is Great
The sound of this awesome speaker is fantastic  Clarity is amazing  yet it has a nice thump to it as well  The size is great if you re not looking for something big  You set it down anywhere and the sound carries itself all over the room beautifully  I m impressed  I do not regret buying this  I love it 
Older versions of this item seemed to get negative reviews but so far we are very happy with our purchase  We ve had it for 2 months and are satisfied  Obviously it only works as well as the internet connection that you have at your physical location  Sometimes working the remote via your laptop can be painfully slow and tedious but the HD quality and overall experience is better than expected 
this is a good product that will handle all of your components 
Have been using SB for many years and upgraded  Great product 
Item charged itself rapidly  and provided ample charge for a tablet and a phone 
Love this thing  now I have my tv and dvr no matter where I am 
The sound is incredible  i love the fact that you can add more speakers if you wish to  it also is water proof  and the dancing lights are a big plus
Very impressed with the backpack  The size was perfect for me  3 lenses  camera body  filters  flash and tripod  I really like the fact that the pack opens to the inside  In other words  I don t worry about someone on the train or bus secretly unzipping the pack with my back turned  Quality product and well designed 
Probably one of the best investments I could have gotten  Glad it can control my WD TV  The first time I ve use only one remote in a long time 
The sling box is awesome and allows you to see your tv from anywhere  Love it and will buy it again
While probably somewhere right in the middle in terms of the gaming mouse tiers  it s a great intro mouse for someone first getting into this line of mice  Larger than most standard    every day mice  great weight and feel  buttons respond great  scroll wheel is smooth  and I love the wired  wireless flexibility  Wish the colors could be configured to stay on one and  or off rather than cycling through all RGBs
Serves my needs perfect  Where we live there is no Internet without it  Love it
I purchased this tv for my disabled son to make life a little easier for him to interact with his media devices  And it has worked great for him 
This is a great wifi speaker I use it indoor to cast music directly from my phone It does work with pandora  spotify  google music  youtube red  tunein radio and it is so easy to connect  reset  re connect to a different wifi spot 
I bought this camera after my dog had been hospitalized with seizures  severe anemia and hypothyroid  Dr  s orders required I monitor him at all time as he was very weak and tired  I was able to leave the house to run errands  get groceries etc while I watched every move he made  I can hear every breath  see every move  talk to him  play five different melodies  take video and still pics  It s simple to set up and operate  Extremely reliable as it is motion activated or you can just watch it live all of the time 
I was looking for a new in dash stereo and had been watching this for a while  Since it s not a cd player  the size of the stereo is smaller than most so it doesn t need as much space in your dash area which was perfect because I had to stash an integration adapter and my satellite radio adapter back there  I only use digital media now so I don t miss the cd aspect  The bluetooth for phone calls and music is very convienient  along with the usb and aux input  Pandora and iHeart Radio are also controlled from it and everything sounds great 
I have had no complaints with this unit  Only thing is it doesn t have a CD player but I don t really listen to CD s anymore so it s a great product 
I love the capabilities of my receiver  With built in Bluetooth and other features I have the same capabilities of most newer car systems 
So ill start off with a little background  I have been using this mouse for about 2 months now every day for work  excel  PDF  word  ect      and intense gaming at home  WoW  League of Legends  DOTA2  and COD   I could not be more happy or IMPRESSED with the accuracy and speed of this mouse  Its perfect  I was very skeptical at first about using a wireless mouse  but this thing is amazing The battery  Gaming  I get about 8 10 hours using this while gaming heavily  which is awesome  Work  study  I m getting ~10 hours Weight  the weight for me was perfect with the added 10g  but if you like a light mouse you can remove that easily from the bottom 
Good receiver at a good price  I like the built in bluetooth which you avoid getting tangled up with wires 
The touch id is also much improved than other laptops as this is the touch version not the slide version 
I purchased this after switching TV Providers and discovering their app was lacking in the ability to watch programs from your DVR in home and out of home on a tablet or smartphone  My previous provider aloud this  The product works well for it s purpose but is slow to respond back from the DVR since it s a live feed  It get s the job done but a TV providers app is still superior 
Great head unit if you are an iPhone user  The unit is set up only for CarPlay  That being said interfaces nicely with my 6s and works well  Only drawback for me is I would like a few more display options  color  backgrounds etc  
I was excited to use this device  as it was to reduce remote clutter on my end table  Also  reduce stress for my wife in what remote does what  Setup account  created 3 tasks  In a perfect world  line of sight would always be available  Significant other would actually turn off all the Home Theater devices in use  When I push  Watch TV   some of the devices may turn on  then everything is out of sync and have to turn each device to same power state  and try again  The other buttons needed on this device is DVR 30 sec skip forward  10 sec rewind  I have to revert back to DVR remote for this function to skip through commercials  as I was typing this   there may be a way to create this function  don t know how   When I am able to spend more time I will try to figure out  as I am past the return date 
This device is so amazing  great clarity  color and transmission    what a great product  
Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea  I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two year old One with the failing buttons  Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways  Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points Software  Try finding Roku for the Harmony  There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku  It s listed under DVD  Go figure  Try Apple TV  Good luck with that one  Brand new hardware  Ultimate One  with the same old crappy software  If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge  maybe they d come up with a better system  but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago Hardware  Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand  taking up much less room on the table where it sits  Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip  They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One  but also removed some pretty useful ones  These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen  Sometimes this works out well  and sometimes not  Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do  For me  I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don t want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony  Yes  troubleshoot  Not everything works right the first time Some inconveniences  Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well  be careful with the Ultimate  About 1  4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other  and we re being careful  Also  for some reason they put the playback buttons  play  FF  REW  etc  above the touchscreen  Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen Set up  Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine tuned to my system  which took months to finesse      set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate  Easy cheesy  I don t look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same  lame  For now  the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution  For me it wasn t  If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don t mind the limitations  then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection  We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment  The old One is still on the charger for my wife s use  she doesn t care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate   The Ultimate is for me  most of the time  The individual equipment remotes are stashed close by in case I need to access something I can t find on the Ultimate If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century  they still have Laserdisc but don t have a proper category for ROKU  and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together  I d love the Ultimate One  If they don t make changes to the software I won t buy a new One when this One wears out 
This keyboard worked great at first  I much prefer a regular keyboard over one on the screen  and this fit the need  However  a few months into its use  my surface pro stopped recognizing it as a keyboard  So now it is just a cover  and I am forced to use the onscreen keyboard  Not happy  I did an online search on how to resolve the problem  but no answers I found were helpful
This remote has a lot of features  Touch screen and customizable settings for nearly all devices  What doesn t work is remote control shades  Now the reason for two stars  the setting up of this remote if you get the smart hub and the smart keyboard is nothing short of a five to six hour event  Logitech support is terrible and you need a lot of patience and time to set this up if you have multiple devices  I have two receivers  bluray  Mac mini  Wii  Luton light wall control  cable box  and TV  so a lot of stuff but nothing really extensive  Once you eventually get it set up  NEVER change anything  because it is basically like starting over with Logitech to set it up  So great idea but bad execution  Lastly the main buttons to control tv playback and fast forward are a little awkward at the top of the remote 
Does a great job turning on and off devices  But the touch screen to input individual numbers does not work  Customer service is ineffective and when they say they will escalate the problem to a higher level  they do not call back
L really like my new hot spot  It is so much better than my old one and much simpler to use and get info when it is feasible to do so  And as always the Geek Squad was great in helping me to choose what I needed  Will definitely keep their service and be back for any problems that arise  Thanks Best Buy   the Geek Squad for their speedy resolution to my problem 
I watch many programs on my iPad  Great reception 
Love my Verizon jetpack  Available data easy to read updates usage quickly
So far working great  great sound system  I would recommend it 
Great overall sound  albeit without midrange speakers  Can t go wrong with Sony 
I m really happy with my Sony speaker  Works great at home with my Samsung cellphone  easy connection and great size to move it from room to room  Perfect 
I was looking for an upgrade over a high end basic mouse mainly for causal MMORPG gaming  The high end gaming mice with 20 buttons were way beyond what I needed  I decided to give the Logitech Prodigy G403 a try and it turned out to be exactly what I wanted  My favorite features are  operates wired or wireless  and color accents on the mouse change as your use it 
These speakers sound really good  Having clear quality highs is important to me  and these products deliver just that  They have a good overall sound 
Great high school graduation present for my nephew 
Pretty good for the money  This is my second time buying a pair for the front and back  Awesome 
Nice format desk top Plenty of storage and Ram Blazing speed Sufficient peripheral connections Future proof Great Value 
very impressed with the sound quality and ease of use 
I have been in the market for a noise cancellation and Bluetooth headphones  I have tried the beats studio wireless headphones and they just didn t do it for me  I understand people enjoy the beats by dre headphones  but I just felt they were lacking  in the sound department  The Jbl Everest 700 Elites were awesome when I tried them  Very comfortable headset  good battery life and quality sound  Very well balanced sound  What I love also is the myjbl headphone app that pairs with your headset  It gives you more control over sound quality I would definitely recommend these headphones for someone looking for Bluetooth and noise cancellation who does not want to settle for Beats 
Sounds great and easy to setup and use  Used on plane for 3 hours and were very comfortable  Can t wait to try on longer flight 
This is am awesome headphone  The treble is warm compared to B W standards  The bass is ample but not overwhelming and the voice tomes are natural  You can hear all the details of the music but also the production which can be good with hi quality music recordings
I replaced an old set of Stax Headphones from the 80 s with these and was very pleased with the sound quality  I use these phones with Records  CD s and a digital Sony Walkman  all sound very smooth much like my Klipsch speakers  The build quality is very good but they take a little while for proper break in for both sound and comfort 
These headphones are great  They have premium sound and has excellent outside noise suppression 
Excellent headphones dont get me wrong  but it just wasnt for me  Would i recommend it yes do i use them now not so much  And if you decide to use them on any android device just know that the phone option doesnt communicate well  Its better for iphone users  I still have to buy my amp for it though  But overall they are great  but not for me as of now
I got Bose   brought them back because there wasn t hardly any bass  These have good bass   treble too  They are noise canceling   wireless  So i like them for that option 
As I travel almost weekly for work  I have plenty of opportunity to wear these out  and I can say that so far  3 months in  they are working out well  My 3rd purchase of 200  dollar headphones  I wanted to try out the 3 major brands in competition  and these are so far the best sub 300 dollar headphones you can buy with ANC  Ive tried the best  Bose 350 dollars for like match to JBL  and the worst to find the JBL outstanding for 240  dollars    bought these on sale   The JBL headphones are comfortable  but not as light as the Bose  but still  they don t weigh down your ears or top of head after 2  hours of use  These are well built  and are flexible for the many different sizes of heads out there  Mine is tiny  so these can look a little goofy on me  but for the average head  they will look just fine  The reason you would buy these though  would be for the Active Noise Cancellation  ANC  and its price point versus Bose  At 240 dollars  these are awesome  At 300 dollars  normal price  I would say its up to the individual if they want to save for the higher priced competition  The ANC is good  but not perfect  and compared to Bose  do not cancel out all of the noise  But what I like about these are the ability to bring 2 different levels of outside noise into the headphones which is nice when your walking around the airports all day and want to avoid collisions  And while the ANC is not the best  at 240  dollars  you really cant go wrong  The best about these? They can be updated VIA the app  Meaning that JBL can fix or update anything related to the headphones without having to physically upgrade over time  While I m not alone on my opinion related to the ANC   seems most tech reviews state the same thing   I would still recommend these at the price point I paid

The headphone sound output is great  and with the app or allows you to change what the smart key does  one thing I didn t like was that it pressed down from the top of my head  and after about an hour my head hurts  so I would recommend these headphones for people with smaller heads or wider heads them people with tall heads  like myself
Needed two sets of bluetooth headphones so we can use both for watching TV at the same time  Great reception   great price  
These headphones surprised me with the quality of sound  The noise cancelling feature is excellent  I appreciate the levels of noise cancelling  Great value 
The headphones was a great gift for my birthday and the sound was crisp and the noise cancellation option is the icing on the cake 
I recently traveled to 3 countries in South America   which included 9 flights  I really enjoyed my new JBL headphones watching movies on my I pad and also those provided by the airlines  In addition  my I phone and I pod got a workout  The Quality and sound is great  Upon return  I also Used the headphones through Bluetooth while I mowed My lawn  Great noise cancelling and quality of sound 
I like the headphones  Especially Bluetooth feature  The sound is really good  I use them between classes and when studying  I also can use them when driving 
Amazing sound and amazing noise cancelling when you turn them on  There a better quality for the price than other brand of noise cancelling and wireless headphones  I love the case that comes because it s hard to find cases online to fit that size 
I bought these headphones on Black Friday for a really cheap price  These headphones exceeded my expectations  The sound quality is amazing on these headphones  I use an Ipod Touch to sync it wirelessly and it syncs w  out any problems  I use it to listen to music while I work out and I dont have to worry about the wires getting caught while I m lifting weights  I just put my Ipod in my pocket and press shuffle and go The bass is good  but not overwhelming  I guess it depends on the quality of the sound file that you re listening to  Overall  these headphones are excellent and a keeper 
Overall  I m very happy with this purchase  The headphones are soft and comfortable  even for laying on your ear on a pillow   Crisp highs and deep bass for such an affordable price  Bluetooth setup was hassle free  My only complaint is the annoyingly bright  flashing light that comes on when they are searching for a source  and sometimes for a while after that   I use these primarily to watch TV or listen to music in a dark room while my girlfriend is sleeping  The flashing light occasionally creates a small strobe effect and wakes her up  Covered it up with some duct tape  Problem solved 
These headphones are a great value  They have very good sound  Not as good as Bose but still good  Being that they were  150 cheaper than Bose or Beats  it is an EXCELLENT value  I highly recommend  Not to mention the battery life is great  I charge them on Monday and they are fine until the weekend for lots of use  Plus they do have a microphone for phone calls also  Great deal 
I was looking for wireless beats to run in  but didn t like the idea of running with a pair of  280 headphones that I will sweat and get dirty  Then there were these for  60  They fit great  sound great  and price great  Cannot complain at all
I travel alot and needed something that had noise cancellation and produced a more dynamic instead of a balanced sound  The Elite 700s work pretty well for this  I do wish they could go a bit louder  but with the noise cancellation  these are great 
So far hsppy with my pink headphones  Perfect for the gym and walking around my neighborhood and very lightweight 
When I hear sounds that I ve never heard before from songs that I ve been listening for years  it is a good sign 
These are some great sounding headphones that I would recommend to anyone  
I researched these pretty well before buying them  reading reviews and discussing different options with friends  It was between these and Bose  and it was actually the Best Buy salesman who sold me on the JBL  which is what he owned  I bought them specifically for flying and I couldn t be more pleased  I was on a couple of smaller  noisy  planes recently and these were great 
We bought them for our son and he is thrilled  Didn t want to pay the high prices for other brands and this is a good substitute
My first pair of headphones and they work very well  Easy to install and use  I use them daily for hours and am very happy with the product  I would definitely recommend them 
I had the opportunity to compare these headphones with Beats and I would choose Everest Elites over the Beats  Beats are definitely louder  but Everest have better sound quality 
AWESOME      Couldn t have chosen a better product 
Battery life is great  comfortable too  doesn t absorb scents
Best headphone I have purchased from skull candy to beats studio 
Better all around headphones than beats  Sound quality is far superior than bose and beats  I have had both pair 
Bought for my son so he can listen to music while he runs  He loves them and wears them everyday 
Clear  works great for what I need them for Would buy again 
Easy to use and set up  My daughter loves them  Noise canceling is great 
Great headphones  very comfortable and sound great
Great sound  very comfortable  and a great connectivity range
I have purchased other headphones in the past and these are my favorite They are lightweight and easy to wear for long periods The app for these headphones allow you to customize the output for headphones to the type of music you listen too 
I love these headphones  At first  I bought a pair for my son  We were so impressed with the sound quality  that I went back and bought myself a pair 
I travel frequently for business and searched a while for a decent pair of headphones  I started with a pair of Thir headphones and then moved onto a  25 pair of cheap wireless headphones  Both broke within 2 months of very light use  Then I had a pair of Beats Studio  I was not impressed with the sound  I took them back and after doing lots of listen tests  chose the Evers Elite 700  Great sound  great app  good battery life  Great controls as well  I liked the sound of the Boss Quiet Comfort 35 just a little bit more  but didn t think the difference was worth the price  I d recommend these headphones to anyone  They aren t designed for a workout  but they re great for flights and long walks 
I was deciding between Bose and JBL but I went with this headphone and its pretty good for listening to music and noise cancelling is great as well  Its not bad for the price as well  I like it 
I went into the store looking for some studio quality headphones and tried out a few different pairs  These JBL 700 elite were a little pricy at first glance but I needed something that was going to give me the quality I really needed for music production and just listening to music in general  I bought these headphones and was pleasantly surprised  The sound gravity is amazing  they have a custom eq setting app and was surprised to find that I can answer my phone and talk on calls with this headset as well  For anyone that has the money I would definitely recommend them 
Is real nice headphone  Is good quality build  Is real nice to have  Is something I would recommend other people 
I ve never owned JBL or wireless headphones  but I d heard of the JBL brand  These turned out to be high quality and comfortable 
My teenagers wanted the Beats headphones for Christmas  I did my research on the reviews of these headphones  For the price I could not pass them up  My teenagers love them and rave about the sound quality  They are wireless which my kids say make it so much easier with their iphones and ipods  The ear piece is a soft leather like material just like the beats headphones and fits over their ears perfectly  Great headphones and I saved over  200 00 for each pair as compared to the Beats headphones and have two happy teenagers  The warranty for two years only cost me  11 99 which was a deal as well  My only wish is that they had different colors for the headphones 
So happy with this product would buy again totally
The headphones are better than I expected  I would recommend them to anyone
The headphones are for my husband  He absolutely loves them  I have listen to a few things with them and the sound quality seems very good  They are a little too bulky for my head  but my husband says they are comfortable 
The sound is just out of this world  I would recommend it to everyone 
These headphones are really great  They seemed a bit pricey at first  but now that I use them so much  it s definitely worth it  It s cool how there is the option to adjust the noise cancellation level  The headphones are very comfortable as well  I did just buy these this past week  but so far I haven t run into any issues and I m really happy with my purchase 
These headphones perform as advertised  I am having trouble using them with Bluetooth  but it s probably user error  I ll post again if I learn differently 
They are great headphones  Not sure why the grey ones where more expensive  yet were the exact same thing as the white ones
They feel stronger then beats by dre  They sound great good bass  The app you can use to adjust the sound and check battery level  It s is a great idea 
Tried them for two weeks and there really great and very loud
Very nice for the price  Great sound  very comfortable  and awesome case 
Work beautifully  Clear sound  Easy to pair with Bluetooth devices and charge  For a inexpensive set if headphones  they are great 
Excellent sound until I listened to the spoken word  My left side had a rattle when certain pitches were obtained 
car play is the way to go if you have an iphone    This is definitely the future of head units  If you can wait you may want to wait until more apps come out that carplay supports but its awesome for maps  music  messages  and calling 
I bought this unit for the Bluetooth and the price but was very surprised by the performance pushing a pair of 6 1  2  and 6*8 kicker speakers 
make sure to get a lightning cable BEFORE you install this it does not come with one and is absolutely necessary to even begin to use it  It works really well and is easy to use 
Sound good and works well with my phone and the alpine tune it app is nice
Long lasting charge and comfortable to wear  I absolutely love them 
No issues whatsoever  Popped it in my PC and it s been working like a champ ever since 
Really pleased with this harmony  Upgraded a 700 series remote that was just about worn out  The ultimate one is solid and easy to use  So far battery life has been great  I really like the touch screen and the hard buttons are the ones I use the most  A good balance between touch screen and hard buttons  The performance of the IR seems better fewer missed commands to my system The charging station is good but I could have used another foot of cord on the power supply  easily solved with an extension cord but it seems a little short 
This is my second time purchasing WD red drives for my Drobo  NAS   I was running low on space  so I hot swapped in two 2 TB drives in place of the old 500 GB ones  Transition was painless  The other 3 drives in my NAS have been 1 TB WD reds  and it has been running non stop for the better part of 6 years without a drive failure    Knock on wood   
If you are looking for a hands free solution  this system is awesome  The included microphone makes it easy for you to be heard even with road noise  Only downside is this deck does not include a CD player  but these days I guess that s like complaining that your CD player can t play tapes   
It sounds great and it makes listening to music a lot easier 
Gorgeous picture quality for the price  Excellent price
Great gift for a family member  My grandmother had a really old tv so we all pitched in to purchase a decent hdtv  She loves it  the picture looks so great and the price was perfect  Highly reccomend 
He has enjoyed this bluetooth speaker He carries it in a backpack so he can listen to music while riding his bike Therefore he is aware of his surroundings better Good quality sound
Got these for my boyfriend and we both love them  Noise cancellation is great  Happy with purchase 
I got these for my husbands birthday  and he absolutely loves them  Easy to use  great sound and they look cool
I got this for my girlfriend because she is about to go on a trip to Africa  The camera back is good protection for her expensive camera and the zipper is on the opposite side from most backpacks so it is difficult for pickpockets to open  My girlfriend loves this camera backpack 
Love this product  Great gift  Endless fun if you re a gadget lover 
I bought it for my little brother and he s told me that s it s great for the games he plays  it s very responsive 
This mouse is very comfortable and responsive  and I love the option to use it either wirelessly or wired  It also goes well with my Logitech Orion Spectrum keyboard    the software to control the RGB lights  other features works seamlessly with both keyboard and mouse  and offers lots of options 
Easily set up  great functionality It included a charging cable that is long so that s nice  the changing colors is cool overall love the mouse for gaming 
great gaming mouse for someone that doesn t what a full end version of one just something responsive with extra features 
Great wireless  wired gaming mouse that won t hurt the bank
Good quality and functions well  Easy to install and sped up my PC 
I bought this Slingbox to use when on vacation although you do need Internet access it works well with my Directv service  I have access on my iPad and iPhone only wish that Apple TV would add Slingbox to their content along with what s already there  Very happy with my purchase 
We have been debating about purchasing the SlingBox for some time  and now that we have it  it is used a lot  We live abroad  and now we can see all of our live Florida TV whenever we want  Picture quality is very good  The only thing we still have to correct with SlingBox is the remote control  When we want to pick our channel  it takes several tries to connect to the right channel  Other than that  we have already recommended it to several friends  Great when travelling as well 
The remote works great  It controls all of my components flawlessly  The only  issue  I have with it is that there are no real number buttons  they are a menu item in the LCD screen  Don t get me wrong  it still works great  but I like to have immediate access  touch and feel of a number pad  The current set up makes for a very nice  sleek  and compact look  but it does require a few extra taps and swipes to get to the number pad  All in all  this is still a great unit 
Great functionality with some shortcomings  I must admit that this device replaced 4 remotes and I am totally hooked  Can t go back to those bulky factory remotes  The problem is that the rechargeable battery life is not very long and you get no warning before it shuts down due to low power  The touch screen is not very sensitive and sometimes it take a couple of times when you need to slide the screen 
Fingerprint function works great  No issues after a month
This was the most flush to the wall full motion mount  So nice to move it around to access the wires etc  Bolts were a little long or too short that came with the kit for my 55  Samsung  2015 model   so I had to cut the longest set with hack saw  One thing to mention make sure you have a recessed outlet so that the mount can be all the way against the wall  Those are about  9 and easy to install 
Amazing sound  set up was quick  did update and it just worked  Many ways to connect  Google cast feature so useful and easy  I love the surround sound set up option and multi room compatibility
Bought the matching pair to give me that sound filling for entertaining outside 
Fantastic quality and perfect for zoom lenses  Material is strong and love the design
This product works great the touch screen is responsive and very easy to use  even for kids 
Would buy these again  They were a gift and used for working out  studying and travel
I have had the first generation of Sling Box and this is a well deserved upgrade    With wifi availability and the available HD connections make this a no brainier to have in your home  What makes it even better now is the option to get the associated applications on as many portable portable devices you have for free    Back when it was first released I dropped  15 for it   
The menu is easy to use and set up for your area  The alarm clock option is a nice plus 
When there is severe weather in the region  this NOAA radio sure gets the alerting job done  especially with its loud tone  we can hear this all throughout our house   Its many features  such as the digital screen  the lights for advisories  watches and warnings  not to mention the multiple channels and being able to set up counties myself  certainly make this radio all the more useful  With the fair share of severe weather we get in our area  it was well worth the money and I would recommend this product to anyone 
Lets me watch my local sports teams when I am out of my local area  Gives a good streaming picture which is close to what I get at home
Easy to installGreat picture and easy to use Minimal time needed
Loses the connection sometimes  Your TV source has to be on at home to view remotely  No HDMI output  Slow start up  Unit does serves its purpose  and has a pretty good picture on your smart phone and iPad 
Great easy to watch tv at a second home our on the road
This is a product to upgrade desktop  8 gig capacity 
I used this for the first year and had one complaint which was the wireless connection would drop frequently  My router is only about 15 steps from the m2 but I did not have Ethernet connection in that room  Once I switched connection to one of the those Ethernet over your electrical outlet  the m2 works great  So in summary  great functionality but wireless is not reliably  Connect somehow over ethernet cable and no more drops 
I mostly got this to be able to watch TV on a TV on our patio so that I wouldn t have to sting cable outside and get an additional receiver  and the charge that comes with it   Works great and apps are available for both apple and fire devices that are free  But the free apps when I watch on the computer start with an ad   which I don t care for   just there is just one  I believe you can buy the paid app which doesn t have ads  I have only used once while away from home and it worked good  Quality is dependent on internet speed 
Great for traveling but make sure your computer doesn t download updates  Large data use for updates and streaming videos  Schedule updates when not using the unit 
This device works really great especially traveling 
Gets a little jumpy but could be a function of internet speeds
Used to keep phone   iPad charged while having computer connected  Charges phone   iPad rapidly  Battery portion of device holds long charge 
Traveling to different cities but don t won t to miss your hometown sports team or tv shows  Then get this internet and cable required
Perfect to watch TV anytime your in wifi reach like in airports 
Effectively blocks out airport noise without hassle of cords draped everywhere 
Gives great availability for those who need to travel or work remote  Wish the battery life was longer for a day 
No need for higher cost DISH or other network fees  This device does it all   as if we were home  when we are traveling internationally  we can watch our DVR back home  Or just when sitting on the front porch  we can watch on the phone instead of going inside to the TV  well done 
bought these for my 94 year old mother in law who could not hear the phone ring  We decided to try this and it worked great Now she answers the phone if you call  she can hear it
I think these things go for  200 and if you got one at  99 you did yourself a nice favor  Controller is great  design  comfort and what it does  Replaces all controllers and executes an activity with one touch  Like playing your game console  changes all inputs  turns off others not needed  If you turn off the  swipe to unlock  you may find yourself touching the screen  executing an activity by accident  I had to turn mine on again after this kept happening  The charging station is really nice and looks impressive  Battery life undocked is only 4 days  so just dock it when you can overnight  Screen has a decent resolution  but not anything to brag about  You can upload your own icons for activities  found mine searching google images for a tv  game  music  etc 
this item was a replacement for my previous surround sound  and for the price it is great  My living room is close to 300 sq feet and the sound is great for the space 
I listen to a little bit of everything but theses sound the best with rock as they tend to get weak in the lows  Great replacements for 07 Civic 
Great sound quality  They are definitely worth the money  My brother bought Beats by Dre and paid 4 times what I did  Mine sound just as good if not better and he agrees  Bummer for him  Take my advice and try a set out  You be the judge  I think you will be pleasantly surprised 
These speakers are great    they blow the competition  the bass really hits and the sound quality is fantastic    this is alpine s low end model  but yet it still beats some of the high end models of other leading brands    if you really want something that will blow your mind try the alpine type r s you ll fall in love and never leave alpine for any other brand   
At first when I was reading reviews about these headphones I got a little skeptical but once I bought these and tried them on for the first time I was impressed  I had never head of MEElectronics before but some of my friends had gotten headphones from this brand before and they were amazed as well  The sound quality is terrific with a deep base  almost on par with most major headphone brands  One of the only issues I ve had with this product is that it slips and slides when I just turn my head a little  In order to solve this I just don t look down while I m bending over and it stays on perfectly  Now even though they slide on your head  they are a great source of music for walks in the park  house work  and even jogs and runs  Overall this is a great product  you can t go wrong with this product for the price and quality 
Excellent product does the job well  Would recomend
I had bought these to replace my old Denon speakers that were blown   I did not have the greatest expectations for such a low price  However these exceeded my thoughts on these  I have a entry level pioneer 5 1 receiver and these speakers will handle it fine  The sub woofer provides more than enough bass In fact I had to be turned down  Not disappointed at all  
Wear with my Ipod when I workout which is five days a week  Very comfortable and so nice not having a chord in the way  i was wearing Bose headphones and yes the Bose sound better but these sound great for the price  are comfortable and no chord  The Battery life is great too and they sink up so fast with my device 
I purchase this headset for a cross country plane ride  They helped reduce engine roar and allowed me to sleep easier 
Sound quality is great  bought this for our office and not disappointed  Bluetooth works great as well  Lacks instructions
I think these outdoor speakers are great for the money  They sound good  are easy to install and look good  Can t ask for anything more  Hooked them up to a sonos and an amp that I had laying around and couldn t be happier 
Great product  The battery last long and love customizing the sound 
has great resolution and audio  i use these frequently and try to keep a few on hand 
Bought the Asus M32 Series PC at Best Buy  3 months later the ram fried somehow  So went back to Best Buy and bought these ram chips  brought them home installed them and PC fired right back up again  Didn t want to bother with warranty and 12Gigs of ram  when I could just put 16Gigs in and be done with it 
I usually have long passwords and the fact that i can get into my laptop with my finger saves times 
Your own movies and live tv if you travel a lot  It would be nice for it to have different tv turner 
Love the sound and the look  it was easy to pair with lap top or phone  but I needed it to party pair with another speaker of the same kind  as manufacturer states this is a feature  but it does not work  Had to return 
I purchased these new JBL headphone to be able to listen to music at the gym I found out that they are not made for that because you can hear every little noise around you  so I will give them to my nephew and purchase me some beats by Dre because I had them before 
Surfaces are great tablets  There are some issues that are common when used in a work environment  I d recommend them for people that are somewhat computer savvy 
This works perfectly in a bathroom or a small room  I wouldn t recommend for a larger room 
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister for her studio apartment  The system is small but the sound is huge 
The best way to describe the listening experience is that the headphones create a sense of you being in the studio while the artist is listening to the final mix of the music  I have had the pleasure to have been in many studios ranging from small home studios  to large professional studios  and these headphones have been the headphones that have made me feel that way  Compared to beats  bose  sony  etc  these headphones are leaps and bounds ahead of them in regards to build and sound quality  There are definitely other headphones that are more expensive and could most definitely sound better  but in this price range  these are amazing  The leather is extremely soft and smells great  The sound is spaced in such a way that you become immersed in sound  I love quality items  I have purchased other brands before  but I have finally found a headphone that is a quality item built to last many enjoyable years 
I need this on my job  I cannot connect to the Wi Fi at work since I don t have the Wi Fi code 
Much better than a laptop So easy to do my online class work  Would recommend for students 
I love it it is the best it is slim and can fit in ur pocket easy
This was great for my kids during a trip across the country  They were able to play on their ipads and I was even able to stay connected as well  Only downfall is data plans are pretty expensive and depending on what you are doing you can go through some date pretty quickly 
Didn t think they could put up with the other after market speakers in the suv but they sound clear and clean when the volume is up their 
bought this as an upgrade from slingbox350 works great i love the added convenience of wifi no need to run ethernet cable anymore picture is crisp watch my tv anywere a definite have if you are a traveler
The compact size is excellent  It s slim and easy to re charge for future use  Wish I had purchased it sooner 
Great device to watch my television on the go  You can watch live programming as well as DVR shows you have saved 
Input lag isn t noticeable even in twitch shooters  battery life lasts roughly 40 50 hours of heavy use  just make sure to turn it off when not in use 
i love the price   lots of features the sound is fantastic 
My son loves it  It is loud enough to hear in your whole house 
we bought the camcorder from Best Buy years ago and they help us get the tapes on line
Got this to watch cable in a second home  Picture quality not as good as normal and sound can be a bit out of syncy when casting to a TV but annoying enough to wipe the smile off my face for not having to pay a second cable bill  No such issues when viewing on a mobil device 
Such a convenient gadget  I can plug and go  Online in seconds and able to work anywhere anytime no delays  Fast too  Highly recommend this product 
Bought this because I have to go to an older office building with tons of interference that affects the wifi  I use this when I m there and I can stream my visors or download the files I needed instead of having to wait until I either when to my office or home
Excellent bag that holds my DSLR  a small lens  and two large lenses  Exactly what I needed 
I have a bunch of these in two NAS units  They have never let me down  Great Product at a great price 
Much needed for my Mother in Law to hear when the phone rings
It is absolutely amazing  Makes calls a lot easier  I can t say enough happy words about this product
Great srs the clarity is perfect hi res audio amazing
I needed more speed and space for gaming and this was a great add 
Great product  looks great in my 2007 Tacoma  And easy to function
Great little radio  does not have disc reader but who uses discs these days anyway  Would recommend also has 3 pre outs for a 4 channel and 2 channel amp which is a plus 
I drove a newer car with CarPlay and wanted this feature for an older vehicle  This stereo is great for that purpose 
I had my old harmony for 8 years and it was super  but the graphics faded and I could not control my devices  I tried the lesser expensive harmony that works with the iPhone  but could not program it correctly  so I bought this model and it s great  Easy to program and works like a charm 
We use ours everyday  It has come in handy on trips 
I got this to hold my D5300 and 4 lenses including my new Nikon 200 500 zoom  I was the only bag I could find that would hold this big lens along with all the rest of my gear  Worked like a charm on an Alaska trip  The only want was for an outside section to be able to put a windbreaker and hat for changing weather  hence the 4 stars 
I have hearing loss and had difficulty hearing our phone ring  This product has helped alot  I like that I can change the tone and degree of loudness to accommodate me 
Got this for my son s first car  Bluetooth hands free keeps his hands on the wheel and eyes on the road  Light weight unit fits without straining single din adapter 
I have had many gopro carrying items but this one is definitely my favorite  Makes everything convient and it protects against theft 
Easy to set up and great product  I watch all the Wild Hockey games at college and the University of Nebraska 
Great remote that ll control everything in your house including tv  cable box  receiver  bluray player  xbox  fan  ac    just about anything with infrared sensor  Only negative is I m upgrading from older Harmony One remote and this is a huge step backwards in my opinion  I don t understand why Logitech decided to change the layout and place the DVR controls on the top  Good luck using those controls without hitting the screen  unless you got huge banana hands  Another negative is the short battery life  My old Harmony One averages 3 4 weeks between charge  this new remote lasts about 3 4 days between charges Still  it is a fantastic remote and I would buy another one immediately if this one crapped out 
Great Home audio speaker system for the price  Speakers sound great  Very happy with purchase 
Very good connection for jobsite trailer  At least two people are using it with no problem 
2 children in school that want to record and watch their tv programs  They love the easy of using this product and easy set up
I use the surface pro and keyboard in class to take notes and I absolutely love it
Got it on sale so it was just a little more than just a lens case big enough for my Nikon 200 500  In use  it is very comfortable and the straps  handles seem sturdy  I can carry a body with 200 500 attached  if I want  and another moderate zoom or multiple smaller lenses plus many accessories  Main compartment zipper runs around the  inside  of the backpack  Purpose is to allow you to take off shoulder straps  keep belt strap attached and rotate pack to your front where it sits like a shelf  A bit cumbersome  but it does work  at which point the zipper arrangement makes sense Only complaint involves the main zipper  It seems to want to foul on the overlapping edge of the pack unless you are very careful  not always possible if you are operating quickly 
This was a great but  It does everything it days and is great for using when mowing the grass 
I spent the money and bought this  Thought it would be a waste of money but it actually provided amazing viewing angles throughout my entire house  When I m sitting on the couch  cooking in the kitchen or answering the door I can watch the tv  The best buy associate actually went on a few different websites to get me the best deal and saved me over 100   I didn t even have to ask 
Just what was needed and works great for the new computer
I use these headphones with my Galaxy S5  Can answer phone while biking by just touching one button  Conversation was clear  even though it was windy outside  Still seems to be a slight lag when watching videos  I did do the latest firmware update 
great way to get bass in the car and tricking people to think you have a sub if you know what ur looking for and how to achieve it great speakers 
Great product  Highly recommend  We use it to backup highly important project documents 
Does everything you need it to and more  wouldn t use any other universal remote 
Love having the print scan key  Its been great for home and work needs 
use this primarily for air travel  and with the bluetooth feature  don t have to worry about dangling cords to get in the way  Sound quality better that average
My husband travels a lot so having these makes it easier for him to access and watch the cable channels we subscribe to live  Fast and easy wifi set up 
This was a great choice for my tower computer  which came only with USB ports and cable port So  I purchased this and have been happily cable free  It s truly powerful and has a very heavy  magnetic base  keep it away from your other electronic devices   
For a fairly small speaker  the sound was great   If you want a speaker for a large area  go with the Ion box type speaker which is quite a bit larger yet the same price as this one  Another option is that you can pair more of these Sony speakers  3 sizes to choose from  with this one for more sound if you want to stay with the smaller sized speakers 
I was having a lot of trouble with the old wifi card on my media server  I didn t want to mess with installing a new card  I don t use this server that often anymore  so this worked great for a quick fix  Easy to set up  good signal  would buy again 
I had first bought a bigger sized Tv for my dorm and it was way too big so I returned it and purchased this one  Its the perfect size and it has great quality 
Great for a 60 in TV  Not as much movement as I thought  but still is nice
It works great especially the waist buckle to open it without having to put it on the floor  It holds my d3400 and maybe one more body  a 18 55mm  55 300mm  50mm and my 70 200mm with space for another zoom     Maybe  Plus room for accessories and filters 
nothing out of the ordinary can be a little cheaper for what you get 
Very responsive  design is tight  Quality is worth the investment 
Very good quality and affordable film  Finding this film is not easy and the film is the best for the price and camera 
The feel of the keys and touch pad is considerably better than the earlier version  but half the time fingerprint reader doesn t recognize my finger is on the sensor  I trust this will get resolved with a patch 
Works with surface pro 3  Feels great  Scanner works well
I bought it a month ago and I ve been using it since then  It feels great and endurable 
Listen   any radio you install on a boat is only good fora year or two  so why pay the big bucks?This unit included AM  FM  Sat  USB  Bluetooth  and Aux I can play on it from anywhere AND it had a microphoneso If I have my phone playing  and it rings  I can answer itfrom the boat using this radio GREAT value Great Features 
Very good unit  Installation was a breeze and very straightforward
The ease of programming  setting up components and accessing them is super  However  Some often used functions are at the bottom of the remote and two hands are needed to press the buttons  Also we have experienced trying to hit one button and actually brush another resulting in the wrong selection  But we ll probably get used to doing it right 
I purchased this product primarily for the features that were available compared to other backpacks at the price  So far  I am happy with the purchase  It s a little more expensive than what I was wanting to spend  for which I knocked off a star 
Very nice system  I love it  It s bigger than I thought
been using it for almost a month  no problems   can also config for other guest users too 
The fingerprint scanner works flawlessly    Would recommend this   
Replaced VW Monsoon stock speakers  Love these  Recommend
Alpine is known to make good car stereos and this one is good if you use an iPhone only  Without an iPhone tethered  it s just a radio with a 7 inch display  With your iPhone it transfers the UI of the phone to the unit  but does not play video  You get your calls  texts  maps  and music apps only since playing video is illegal when driving  If your an iPhone user  I would highly recommend it 
Waited for six months while I did some research on this device  I know no Bluetooth on this device is a game changer  negatively  for some  but I have not been a great fan of Bluetooth  And as I can charge my iPhone with it  I actually prefer this non Bluetooth version Heard Bluetooth is coming Used it for over a week and it is better than I d hoped for  using Siri has been very useful  There is still some things  she  gets confused about  but overall makes  hands free  driving very possible I would recommend steering wheel controls if possible  as that makes hands free more realistic Overall  I am very pleased with my purchase 
The tech that installed stereo in truck was awesome that is one reason I buy from Best Buy   Best Buy does not need to lose him   Very professional  
The service was excellent in sales and in installation  I am very happy with the product 
Stock replacements  great quality  Very happy     
I bought this as a gift for my younger brother that just bought his first house  Along with it I gave him an older 5 1 Sony receiver  STR DE845  to make up his first surround system  I was actually quite impressed with this set up in a medium sized room  The sound from the center and sattelites was detailed  and very clear  The 8  sub had no problem pumping out plenty of LFE for the room  Obviously this is not an audiophile quality setup  but it is a competent setup that far exceeds the low end HTIBs that are out there 
Excellent sound   easy to set up  The comfort of wireless plus great sounds makes for pleasurable listening 
l like the fact that you can use your earphones for using a regular phone and hear it well
for the money these are the best earphone that provide noise reduction and sound clarity 
These are great dvd cassettes used for my camcorder  The quality of the picture is very good 
Tapes are very reliable which makes taking video a breeze 
Purchased the sony DV cassette for a church ceremony  it worked great  easy to use 
This is a great bag that can fit your DSLR and a variety of other accessories 
Bought 3 for my new QNAP NAS  Recommended by QNAP and they re working flawlessly since I got them about a month ago  I ll definitely buy more when I need NAS drives
The Red series by Western Digital has been fantastic in my Media Server  I have 8 2 TB drives in it  and I have been running ZFS in a RAIDZ 2 configuration without a hitch for some months  Several of the drives have been in the server for over a year  and not a single error has occurred  Since they support TLER  these drives are great for RAID arrays  both software and hardware  
I used to always buy only WD Green drives  but with those phased out  I gave Red a try and have been pleased thus far 
excellent hard drive for a drive bay  server runs nice and quiet
Great double din  Wished it had a DVD player but overall works very well with an iPhone  Love the Siri feature 
I bought this system for my dorm room  To be honest it is huge  It is much larger than any other system I was looking at  This is ok though because of the fact it produces so much sound  It would probabaly work fine in any space smaller than 5000 square foot  It is very loud but has great bass too  It also has many features to help you make it have less bass too  I would recommend this system to college students  It does a great job starting a party and blocking out unwanted noise when studying 
As a frequent traveler outside the US  I was constantly frustrated at not being able to watch the TV shows that I love  After hearing about Slingbox I researched it as a viable connection of my TV service to a personal up streaming service that I could watch anytime  anywhere  I discussed my needs with the Best Buy staff and finally selected this model  As I write this I am in a weeks long trip in which I have been able to watch TV shows and my own recorded shows directly from my box  One of the best recent technical discoveries in our household 
I purchased the Harmony Ultimate One to replace my aging Harmony 1100  I like the one handed form factor of the Ultimate One  the ease of set up and use  One remote to control all of your home theater devices  The battery typically lasts me 2 3 days  For some reason I remember my Harmony 1100 lasting me a bit longer than that  but it is not a deal breaker  I just needed to train myself to remember to drop it on the charger more frequently  I chose the Ultimate One over the more expensive Harmony Ultimate because I do not have any of my devices hidden in cabinets that would require the IR blasters or the Harmony Hub 
Great for someone who has a relitive who no longer can hear a phone ringing great product 100% 
This device is awesome  No annual fee and screen is more clear than I thought  
This device does exactly what we wanted it to do  We are able to easily move the television into the exact line of viewing that we want  I am glad we purchased this instead of just a regular tilt mount 
The Slingbox is a really great device  It allows you to replicate essentially and your TV is by streaming into a device  If you use your phone or tablet it works perfectly  I also use it to stream to my Roku TV which works flawlessly  Donely downfall is that changing the channel does take a bit of patience  Of course since it is a stream it is not a direct channel change and takes about five seconds to load and D buff  Overall the streams work great as long as your Internet connection is good but that is obvious  The overall device is an excellent purchase  I highly recommend this device 
this is a great purchase  my advice is to configure an activity at the time  I tried to do all at once and failed  first add your devices  sync and log off  come back and create your activities sync and log off  then add your favorites  start with one channel at the time  then add 2 or 3 at the time  I know it s a pain  but is working fine 
It makes entering into the surface pro much faster and easier  The fingerprint reader works great as long as you keep it clean 
Good device
great box to watch tv whereever you are     this is awesome
Harmony is easy to use More times than not  my Samsung TV will not syc with the sound bar and cable box  The help feature or fix it yourself feature allows the user to easily syc your devices 
It s as if I pick up my cable box and carry it with me wherever I go  When I couple it with Apple TV or Chromecast  I can throw the show to my TV  This is great for my weekend home where I m trying to minimize cable costs  I also recently travelled to Asia and was able to watch my local stations halfway across the world  I love this product 
Logitech   Harmony Ultimate One works very well  It is apiece of mind just having one single device operating several equipment  It is touch screen  which makes the device more easy to operate 
This is a very nice and useful device for all of us to have it 
This machine replaced a 2007 Dell XPS  It has lots of RAM and a great processor  Boots quick  A little pricey  but you do get what you pay for 
Happy with my purchase  Replaces an old and slow desktop  Getting used to Windows10 is interesting 
Had bought an  800 laptop from Dell and was very disappointed   so slow  This desktop is so much better and only a few hundred dollars more 
Recommended by store staff  Exactly what I needed to run my expanding business  So far no complaints
I like this desktop  Its a very fast and compact  
The design creates great sound quality when positioned correctly  It s important to position the speakers in front of a wall or barrier as described in the instructions to opimize speakers capabilities  These speakers sound much better than the Bose system that they replaced and the Bose system actually sounded pretty good  Outdoor speakers inherently are usually lacking in sound quality  The sound quality you get out of the Definitive Technology 6500 though  are about as good as it gets in a outdoor speaker 
Great deck but some things can be tweaked third party application icons such as Google music don t show up and it s kind of annoying also there are no different background displays
Alpine makes a great product and the Apple car play is awesome 
Father In law loves his tv and hubby wanted a kindle to read books because he travels so much 
The sound quality is great  but one wish for this product is for it to be louder  Also  I am not sure what engineer developed this  but they made the power and USB the same ports  leading to potential break of the product  There is a warning sign  but try reading that at night when your trying to charge the product  If I could recommend an alternative product  I would go with JBL or JamBox
Great price  Great sound  Great deal  Would definitely recommend this to anyone 
Great Deal For the       I don�t have the best hearing  but this sounds great and it�s very easy to pair with my iPad  and not having to deal with hanging audio cables when I travel on an airplane is a big plus  Overall  I�m glad I did not give in to the  300   400 they�re asking for the other brands

Clear with no static  Provides warnings earlier than my I Phone 
Good ram  even better price  really can t go wrong and looks killer in my daughters all white computer with a window 
Tech was extremely helpful  installed them in 30 min  my self sound great 
For a keyboard  cover  it s a solid unit  A great edition to my new Surface 
A lot improvement on this cover keyboard I would definitely recommend it
Easy to use  has finger print ID also   makes typing very easy
I love my Microsoft Surface Pro 4 fingerprint cover  It s easy to set up  It works great with my Surface Pro 4  I read all the reviews and took a chance on it  It s a little pricey but well worth it  I would recommend it to all  Thanks Best Buy
I love my new Surface Pro cover  It is durable  The fingerprint ID is wonderful and the face recognition is great  I would recommend this product to everyone 
Easy to install  easier to use  The slim fit and new design looks great and sits in a nice vertical position in the charger  One handed use works well with the ultimate one 
Smooth movement  and Im glad there arent a million buttons  The charger doesnt get in the way when i use it while its plugged in either 
The Logitech Harmony Ultimate One remote started out as a great product with easy on line programming  Controls all my devices  even older model equipment such as a CD changer  There are several serious drawbacks  First  the remote is rechargeable and that s great if you have an outlet to plug into at your favorite chair  otherwise  the battery dies without warning  It at least should have a low battery alert that gets your attention  There are times it seems to loose functionality while it still looks active  apparently when losing the charge  Doesn t turn on all the devices   and won t repeat a command  see below   Secondly  it is awkward to impossible to use with one hand  The touchscreen must be reached across for some controls and can be touched inadvertently  The remote has an odd shape and is not comfortable  Third  if you use the remote to turn something on  it will not repeat the same command without first choosing another command  If for any reason the device changes conditions  such as the input source  from the condition the remote left it in  you must turn it all off  or choose another command before you can reuse the first  You may think it is  locked up   Even though the touchscreen can be inadvertently touched causing an unwanted command  choosing by touching is not that easy  especially numbers  It has a vibration feedback that takes some getting used to but you better learn to use it or you will have many missed touch commands  Lastly  it does not play well with a  DirectvReady  TV when operated using that feature  Using Logitech instructions  you can get some functionality  but plan on a slow process of training individual buttons to individual commands  Considering the awkwardness of the remote  it soon became not worth the trouble  Logitech s technical support was useless in helping understand or resolve the problems  If you are technically savvy  you can probably do it yourself  but the original remote will be nearby in my experience  Even when trained  the time it takes for the TV to show a picture when choosing to  Watch TV  with the  DirectvReady  as the input  is painfully slow while the TV searches for a Genie etc Also  the complexity of a smart tv with all the menu options makes using the remote more trouble than it is worth  So  it s great for having replaced several remotes and simplifying commands such as turning on and controlling a CD changer and surround sound system  But the functionality and usability for a smart TV and  DirectvReady   operates as a Direct TV  mini   is a drawback  There simply are not enough named button choices for it to be intuitive to use easily  I can only recommend it for the ability to turn on the right devices for a particular function  such as listen to the radio or watch a DVD  It s too expensive when you can t do it all with ease 
Purchased this computer about a month ago  Have had great success with it  and it works perfectly 
Second Dell I have bought  Seams like they just get easier and easier to set up  It was amazing and very fast 
We have had Dell computers before and have always been very pleased with their service 
computer setup is great for home office and for studentstook me longer to get everything hooked up and working because everything didn t go as I was told by the geek squad  Everything was not installed as I d requested of the geek squad and I had to figure out how to do it myself 
The computer is fast and very quiet  Start ups and restarts are so fast compared to my old computer  With the amount of RAM installed  there is no lag  I have not seen any thrashing or boot problems  Great choice
Great computer  have space for expansion  card space
I bought this for my daughter and it is working great  Her old one has not been operating for about 2 years and I finally said that I would buy one  The only important items she had on her old one was her photos  I had the Geek Squad remove the hard drive and transfer all photos to the new computer  Thank goodness it still worked 
i got lucky mine came with a dedicated video card if it didnt i wouldnt of bought it its nice and small i am older and i dont need a big box with lights its great for games and business
Performance is excellent  Very fast and responds very quickly 
Really like this sweet deal  I enjoy typing on it and surfing the web and rocking the net 
This computer is great for what we need as a personal home computer  Has the speed for our usage  I would highly recommend this product as a personal home computer 
Great Mouse  having owned the wired version of this the wireless definitely made me react faster  from Playing Competitive Overwatch to CS GO it s all about the preference and seeing how wireless has come a long way I m going to join the future  D
I love the old Harmony One 900 Remote  It is a great remote  About a year ago it could no longer hold a charge  so I got a replacement battery on Amazon  When I tried to replace it  I noticed that the stock battery was so inflated that it would not come out  I talked to Logitech tech support  and Logitech being the incredible company that it is  sent me a replacement  The problem is they no longer produce the 900  so I got this thing  I have used it for about a year  It is a fine remote if you have never used the 900  or never use the tracking buttons located at the top of the remote  If you do  as I do  and as many reviewers do  you will be annoyed with it  Proponents of this remote will tell you that you can program any button you want on the touchscreen  but not everything benefits from a touch screen interface  Remote buttons are one of those things  Especially when you don t want to take your eyes off your TV  Have you ever tried to control your A  V equipment using the IR blaster on your phone Its a similar experience Pros Nice ergonomic back  allows for dual handhold positions  which are required to access tracking buttons at topIR blaster works niceNew software allows easier programming  It was pretty easy before however The charging base is ok  I prefer the 900 charging base where the remote lies flat The battery isn t about to explode Cons Using it as a remote There are touchscreen buttons to go back on the screen without a hard button return  Most users  thanks to Apple  are accustomed to a permanent go back hard button  This doesn t exist In the end I couldn t use it anymore  I found a tutorial online how to dismantle the 900  replaced the battery  and it works as good as new  Much better experience 
As stated in an earlier review  this has turned out to be a great companion to the Surface Pro   love the fingerprinting module   ease of login  good for privacy  makes it easy to type on the surface pro
The type cover works great with the Surface Pro 4  Convenience of the fingerprint scanner is worth the extra cost 
I love everything about this stereo  the only issue I have is that I wish it would be able to play automatically every time I start the car  Unfortunately I have to press play each time 
Bought these to replace in ear type  Love the size features  and sound quality  Cannot go wrong for the price 
These headphones rival Bose s top of the set  They are just as quiet and the sound quality is excellent  Plus its at least  150 less  Nice pair of headphones 
These headphones sound and feel great  My only issue is how delicate the neck is  Don t bend them too much and you will be just fine
Purchased this for my daughter s college grad boyfriend who will be moving into a new apartment  He was thrilled with the sound 
My wife got this for me for Christmas and I set it up right away  Great product
Best buy customer service was great recommend these speakers such good quality and now im going to buy there 69 for the back
Best buy customer service was great recommend these speakers such good quality and now im going to buy there 6�9 for the back
Live how fast it charges my Samsung Galaxy Note 5    just wish the cable was longer
It works perfect  exactly the same the came with the original purchase
For anyone that s had it with annoying buffering from their cable company s TV streaming  get this little box  Initial setup can be a little confusing especially with WI FI  Just make sure the Slingbox and device you re casting to are on the same network  Also make sure you download the phone  tablet  PC  or Mac specific app for each device  The tablet app for example will not work with your phone  App can be a bit temperamental at times  especially when trying to initially connect  Some of the app s graphic interface is not as intuitive as I would have liked  It takes a little while to learn how to navigate through the options  OK  now the pluses  The picture quality is great  True HD with very little or no buffering  I can even watch DVR recorded shows on my tablet  The coolest feature is the virtual TV remote  It�s an on screen replica of your TV  cable remote  The free app has some startup ads  which are not overly intrusive  In fact  you can skip the commercial after a few seconds  A great little device  much smaller than I thought it would be  that very effectively acts as a second cable box  The somewhat minor caveats expressed above prevent me from giving it a full 5 stars

Was happy to be able to find this cassette for my video camera  ThanksBest Buy 
The case was light weight and allowed me to carry all I needed for my shoot  It even had a holder for my tripod 
I m a construction estimator and I use my surface pro for estimating  I needed a tough case  Not only is it tough  but it has an awesome pen holder on the top 
If you only have an iPhone and want to use carplay  this is a great system  However it does NOT have bluetooth or HD radio support Unlike most other double din units which are 6 inches in depth this mechless unit specs in at only 3 inches deep which gives you a LOT of extra room to work with when installing Overall great product and build quality  however a bit pricey for not much connectivity
I ve had this for over a month and this stereo is great  Easy to install  setup and operate  I have a 32 micro flash card installed in the USB slot and play all my music through there  I have streamed iheart over Bluetooth and it works flawlessly with my iPhone 6  If you need to charge your phone you can do so by plugging in the USB as well 
The radio works fine and I have no serious issues with it 
This stereo had great sound and great technology excellent
I tried 3 backpacks and happy to say   this one is the best  it is great for outdoors photography with a 100 400 mm telephoto lens  And no more sand on my back  
Durable and comfortable  I carry my Nikon DSLR  70 200mm zoom  28 70mm zoom and a 50mm portrait lens in it comfortably 
Keeps camera safe  Still not sure about the flip side feature  Traditional way is better
Purchased this bad after buying a new digital camera  bag has room for the camera and the 2 lenses that came with and all the cables etc and there is room for more  o  glad I bought this
This is the ultimate camera bag that is a back pack  Everything fits in pockets and is padded well with extra for chargers  SD Cards and anything else that might be needed  Another unique thing is that there is a place on the outside for your tripod which makes it great in that you don t have to carry it separately  easy off and easy stored  Will recommend to anyone that is looking for a backpack camera bag 
Fast despite being an energy efficient drive  Best buy shipped the drive securely while other retailers online fail in this  Another great WD product 
The speakers were easy to install considering I have never installed speakers before  You want to make sure to purchase the speaker harness as well  I used them in my Avalanche  The sound quality is great and am very pleased with my purchase 
I bought these for my son s 2000 BMW 323 since he had blown his OEM speakers  They exceed the OEM in both quality and range  besides being reasonably prices  Also  very easy to install with the accessories provided  I recommend these speaker as a replacement for similar applications 
Bought this for my husband for father s day  He loves it  Great sound and easy to connect  Only issue is that we can get it to connect with an IPhone
Enjoying every minute of this television  The sound level is decent pictures are bright and clear  Would definitely recommend   
I love this purchase  I only wish I bought a model where I don t interfere with someone watching the same cable box the sling box is hooked up to    other than that it s a great buy  
Bought these bluetooth headphones and I m very happy with the purchase  The sound is very crisp and clear  Easy to pair with my Iphone 6S  They perform beyond my expectations 
Good sound and easy to use  Lights are decent too that go with the beat 
Plugged and played with no issues  Great RAM for the price
sling box works amazing and your able to watch tv from anywhere 
This is a great buy  I got it on sale so it was worth every dollar spent  You have to play with the display settings to get the best picture quality 
This is the best system we ve had so far  The sound quality is great  A bonus is the different color lights
Went into Best Buy looking for a computer desktop for my wife and found one on sale that matched our needs  The salesman was great and very helpful 
This is a very nice head unit that utilizes Apple s Car Play  It installs easily in a 2 Din slot  I installed it in a 986 Porsche Boxster without any issues  Just note it doesn t have a CD  DVD player  The sound is very nice with the stock speakers  And the unit is very shallow making room for the nest of adapters and cables used to connect everything  So  if you are looking for a CarPlay head unit  this is nice 
A friend of mine has some SONY speakers that he has had for a few years now and i loved them  I purchased these thinking they would be just as great or better  I noticed that these are louder  but his have a much powerful bass  and half the wattage  Overall these speakers are great  but i was expecting the bass to be a little more powerful  even with the Bass Boost  Great for a party or something though  i m just a bass fanatic 
Got this for my dad for his birthday  Hardest part is having to get all the model numbers of your electronics  Super useful and it s great to be able to recharge instead of replace batteries 
The new UE Megablast is a newcomer to the UE lineup  Now I have never owned a product in this lineup however I have seen an overall positive impression so I was excited to try it out for myself  This speaker promises omnidirectional sound output  waterproof ability  and the new Amazon Alexa capabilities What�s In the Box?  The box has a REALLY neat design   UE Megablast speaker Quick Start Guide Micro USB cable USB ChargerDesign  The cylindrical design is not new to me however this size is  It is fairly large in length and girth  The speakers are covered with a metal mesh where the two 25mm tweeters  two 55mm drivers  and two 85mm x 50mm passive radiators pass sound through  On the bottom of the speaker is a circular rubber cover protecting the micro usb port for charging  There is also a removable D ring underneath the speaker which is also used for charging using the optional charging base   Not included  Up top is the power button which is a straight line that illuminates  The oversized volume buttons were VERY hard for me to locate when I first used the device  Well the end up being RIGHT in front of you  I had a couple comments about the buttons resembling a religious cross  Features   Rugged Design   Omnidirectional Sound  Fairly new to the market although not my first speaker   Up to 16 hrs battery life  IP67 rating  STRONG Bluetooth Connection  I was able to go to any corner of my house and the speaker didnt hesitate a bit  Other speakers typically did cut in and out or stop altogether   Wifi music streaming from IHeartRadio  Amazon Prime Music  and TuneIn Radio through Amazon Alexa  Pandora and Deezer are hopefully coming in the near future    Integrated Amazon Alexa voice assistantAudio Quality  One thing I noticed as soon as this speaker started to play music was its overpowering volume level ability  This speaker was able to get LOUD  I wasnt expecting such an ability out of something this  relatively  small  Now this isnt the only speaker I have in this price range that can do this but it is the first to do it well  The mids and highs are very sharp  Very little distortion while turning the volume up  The bass however does become slightly distorted and cannot get the same depth as my Addon T3 speaker can  The Addon T3 won awards for sound quality in the past so it doesnt surprise me but it is something to note  The Megablast does get louder than the Addon T3 and is not directional so it has the overall win in my book but I love the classy design and sound quality of the Addon better Problems  I did have very weird  Auto  connection problems with the UE  It would randomly connect to my phone while just sitting on the counter AFTER the speaker was turn off  I found this annoying but it seemed to go away after a couple days  Im also not a huge fan of the fact this came with Amazon Alexa capabilities because you need an Amazon account to participate with the feature but I have a Google Mini that fulfills those need overall  Another problem is the charging brick  its huge  It must be plugged in the TOP outlet for the bottom one to be usable at all  Its way to big    Overall  I think this speaker has very good sound quality and with the omnidirectional sound is a bonus  The waterproofing benefits can be a huge benefit if you plan to take your  300 speaker with you wherever you go but mine will likely stay at home with the occasional outing  A solid speaker I would definitely tell others to take a look at if your in the market 
Got these mostly to listen to music which they work great for  The phone mic and use is a bonus 
I used my Slingbox with my old Comcast cable box that had component connections  Most of Comcast s new X1 boxes don t have component connections  Good bye SlingBox   HDMI interface does not work with Comcast  
Good overall sound reproduction and great bass with the boost on 
However  I was disappointed it would not sink up with the previous model  a Sony SBX 3  So I gave the old one to my son  I plan on buying a second one the next time they go on sale  I m looking forward to listening in stereo through multiple Bluetooth speakers 
This little thing has the best sound that I ve ever heard from a wireless speaker  Battery life could be a little better but the sound quality is definitely worth it 
Great Sony Bluetooth speaker pairs easily with my IPhone and the sound is awesome also very loud in a room
Great speaker for a great price  You will not find more bang for your buck  I guarantee it 
Has a great sound and is convenient  Easy connection 
Pretty loud  not to heavy could take it anywhere with you
Great Bluetooth radio  Easy to use and syncs easy to phone 
Installation was easy and with the addition of a mic for calls is a plus  getting the radio setup was quick and easy  5 star
I have a company phone with low quality sound  and I do Tech Support all day  while doing my own service calls  I link this headset to my phone for the calls  and to my tablet for music  and just enjoy 
Used this headset on my recent trip to Las Vegas  The headset is very comfortable and easy to pair with my iPod  Kindle  and surface tablet  Controls are easy to use on the headset  by touch  and are very responsive  I also used the wired cable to watch the in flight movie  which worked well and easily switched back to bluetooth when the movie was done  Great experience 
I spent weeks agonizing over my purchase  To spend untold amount of money for great headphones as opposed to a more realistic outcome for my money  I tried the Bose Bluetooth  Beats  Sony  Skullcandy headphones and for my money the JBL Elite 700 gives you the most bang for your buck  They are comfortable  Sound is excellent  comparable to the Bose  but significantly better than the Beats  Sony and Skullcandy  The JBL app lets you fine tune the headphones to your liking and is very user friendly  Battery life is incredible and the noise canceling feature  although Bose still leads in this area  is great considering the headphones are about 50 dollars less and the Bose doesn t even offer Noise Cancelation in their Bluetooth headphones 
Great sound and easy to setup bluetooth with the home system and decent range as long as there arent any walls  Battery life seems to be good but I typically only use them for a couple of hours at a time and have them plugged in when not in use Overall great for the price and easy to use 
Great headphones  bluetooth  for the price and hold charge for hours of listening 
I wanted something that would be good for me to work out with and listen to my music wirelessly  These worked great  The only problem is you have to charge them into a computer  If this isn t a problem  then it is great 
Sounds clear   Easy to program to smart phone or iPhone  
I REALLY LIKE THE FACT I CAN TALK ON MY PHONE HANDS FREE
Best Headphones in the  300  400 price range in my opinion  A little bulky but sounds better than the p5s  Lower frequency Bass is more present but not overwhelming like other headphones  Really good all around headphones and efficient too 
I charges 2 i phones 5 times before I had to recharge this  Love it 
This battery work very well and gives the charge you need
I really enjoyed my 1st gen beats pill but I needed to replace it  When I learned you could connect up to 10 of these speakers wireless I had to try them  I ended up buying two and it works great when we want outside music  Cool features is that you can set up the speaker in stereo  meaning one can play as the left speaker only and the other right speakers only  This gives it s a nice dynamic sound of any space 
I got this one because of the great battery life  The sound is average  and the bass boost has to be turned off most of the time  When songs are supposed to have that massive amount  you can turn it on without drowning out the rest of the sound  The flashing lights are neat at first  but I have them off too  Overall  it s decent  but not amazing 
Works very well  and has great battery life  I like the status display window 
So far so good  Keeps my phone charged when I need a charge when I am on the go  It s very convenient and effective 
My phone always is charged  I would recommend this to a friend 
Can get real loud  lights are great for parties  Would be better if chargeable battery
I was very surprised by the bass quality given the price  Works great in my sedan as the tweeter really adds the extra sound quality to give these speakers 5 stars 
Very Satisfied   This speaker has great Bass and sound    and the Bluetooth range is exceptional   
Excellent picture quality and easy setup  This tv has all the basics you need  multiple hdmis and smarthub  Only complaint is the remote  seems cheap for tv 
Got them for my grandkids to be compatible with my DVD player  They work great 
this unit was for a client  he is very satisfied with the simplistic operation and settings 
I ordered 2 of them to build a computer and one worked flawlessly while the other failed 
Just purchased this stereo and it exceeded my expectations  Good price for a high power complete system  I can turn it up all the way with no distortion  Bass is tight and volume is super loud  Great product 
The P7 s are very detailed in sound  and is great for hearing the brass  strings  and other intricate instruments without it being drowned out by heavy bass 
I have a burton bag and it was to big I love the fact if your going to the zoo a game or outdoor it fits two lens perfect with my flash Had it out in the rain and the bag was water repellent
Great bag to carry your cameras and lenses and other assorted gear and water bottles
very nicely done  comfortable and easy access to any part i need 
The Lowepro 300 offers great storage and protection for my Canon D70 and 3 lens  only complaints is that I would have liked more room for something like a tablet 
Wanted a bag for my gear that was not a shoulder bag  Found this backpack to he perfect  I have 2 bodies and a 70 300 zoom that fit perfectly 
just enough slots for a beginner for your gear  I can see myself growing out of this  but for now it s perfect 
Purchased to store my Canon Rebel T3i  I also have a few accessories as lenses and chargers  I have a pair of binos and a Sony DSC QX 100 and it all fits perfect  I love the protection of the bag  It looks well made and very durable Love the fact that now I have one place for all my accessories 
The bag is great I lets carry a DSLR with 70 200 attached  However the configurations are very limited  ans I could use a weather cover 
easy to use and very comfortable to wear  great for every day use and travel
Got this bag because the one I had was to small  this bag fits all my lens and other things I might need lots of pockets Slings are very comfortable and got it on sale   
I bought this bag about a year and a half ago and I still use it until this day  it fits my full frame canon with it s zoom lens  2 canon speed lights  couple batteries and a charger  SD cards  AA batteries  and a small prime lens 
This bag is great for one camera body  three lens and misc  items  Love the side pocket for personal items  Entirely safe with the opening against your back 
This is a well performing back up battery for Android devices  It is very thin and lightweight  fits in any pocket  I especially like the built in connection cable that pulls out and retracts when finished  There is no chance of leaving the house without the cable  It charges my Android phone and Galaxy S2 Tablet with power to spare  Good item  excellent price 
I purchased this to use when working from home since the laptop plugs into a docking station in the office  This works great and gives me the second power cord that was needed  It was also cheaper than buying directly from Lenovo 
Great storage for my camera and lenses  Comfortable way to transport my camera 
Love the new backpack  It has all the room for equipment plus more  
I bought this to handle not only my present needs  2 additional lenses   but also for future needs   flash  meter  etc  I like that the opening is against me when I am using it  as I don t need to worry about anyone stealing anything out of it  It holds either my monopod and my tripod  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a mid size backpack 
right size to hold all camera equipment light weigh to carry around
Bought this as a backup  recovery drive  have yet to complain 
Love this and stillUse them everyday and very comfortable 
I used this set a lot  but I got it because it was the best I could afford  and frankly the quality  durability was not durable  Very susceptible to sweat and buttons eventually sank in  Gave it back and traded for another type of headphones 
Easy to program and works as advertised  I had a little bit of a problem getting my original Harmony One remote to transfer settings from old remote to the new one but when it did transfer everything was working 100%   A   
I ve been an Apple user for 15 years  I ve enjoyed all of their products and services  I chose this radio over the Pioneer CarPlay radios because Alpine s implementation of CarPlay was the purest and simplest  After having this radio for a few weeks  I can say there are 2 downsides  1  there is no CD player  not a big issue for me   and 2  I miss the tactile feel of a volume button  Alpine uses a touch screen like button for volume which forces you to look at the display to change the volume  my car lacks steering wheel controls   I love the Siri button  It makes everything so simple One of the main reasons I bought this stereo is the city of Austin  Texas implemented new laws which makes it illegal to hold your cell phone and to drive  The Siri integration allows me to make calls and send texts without touching my phone For those of you who have noticed this radios lack of Bluetooth or Wifi  just wait  There are a few a secrets which will be unlocked during a future firmware update  perhaps this summer  This should help justify its relatively high price  So far I am enjoying trying out all of the CarPlay compatible apps on my iPhone    Please note the associated photo is not mine  it was taken from a Reddit post
love this radio siri is awesome and text and phone calls are very clear
I have many portable chargers but have never seen one like this where I have a ac adapter and USB adapter in one vet convient and great
Great Fast 7200RPM HDD  The best one that Best Buy offers right now  Make sure to price match 
This was purchased for my sons replacement hard drive for his PS4  can t ask for a better amount of space or brand for the price 
This works great installed on tv in one state and watch from another state 
The overall feature set of these wireless nc headphones is what sold me on them and they were  100 less than Bose  The noise reduction is great  the sound fidelity and soundstage are excellent  still some small hiss like other active nc headphones but you don t really notice while listening to music   and the ability to adjust the amount of ambient noise you can hear in order to hear  talk with others via Ambient Aware settings is very convenient  I didn t have to take my headphones off while talking to flight attendant   The JBL app works great on my GS7 to tweak EQ settings as well  Not as light  comfortable  much more bulky on your ears  as Bose but their new wireless nc headphones have way too much bass for my taste  JBL s have better mids and highs too  and I didn t feel the  pressure  sensation on my ears with these JBL s like I did with the Bose either  Still very pleased with my purchase with over month of use  These are great to take a nap  listen to music  or hear the audio on a tablet while others are watching tv 
Able to hide all components in one cabinet and control them with one remote 
This is great because it turns on everything at once  The DVD player  cable box  TV and sound bar  Also has a help button that can fix something if it doesn t turn on  It is directional sensitive though  Need to make sure you are pointing it right at the TV and attached devices 
I purchased this remote needing a better solution to having 5 remotes  This product did not disappoint  The modes are great and make all my devices rin seamlessly 
The touch screen works great and programming is reallly easy  I got it on sale so it was worth the price  The only con is the battery life  If you keep the remote on the charger then yourre fine 
Was looking for a new family room remote to control tv tivo yamaha tuner  blueray player and apple tv all with the push of a single button The Logitech   Harmony Ultimate One did all this and has room for more 
I love the battery life on the megablast and being able to connect my Amazon account to use Alexa
Great sound  Looks great  Included mounting hardware is terrible though  Had to buy my own L brackets to mount perpendicular  Overall very happy though 
This is my second Harmony remote  I must say it is a great improvement  Works very well and I would definitely recommend it 
Great hi end head phones without completely breaking the bank  These are expensive at  400 but I don t see upgrading these and just can t justify the cost of the top of the line cans out there  The look and feel of these with the metal  leather  and magnets construction is fantastic  A little big for active use  but great for home  office  travel  I just use earbuds for exercise and wouldn t want to sweat up nice phones any way so the size isn t an issue for me 
I bought these to replace my stock speakers in the front doors of my 2014 Ford F 150  They fit and sound great  much better than the cheap paper factory speakers  Only complaint is that I had to buy the wiring adapter for my truck at a specialty store  but I blame Best Buy for that  not JBL
It didn t have graphic card with my 1st order   i exchanged it    it is great   i recommend this desktop gaming and office   
I went in to buy a  Beat  but the sales guy convinced me this was a better buy  I brought it home and my son totally agreed  Good shopping experience 
I drive a 2008 Porsche Cayman which has no option of connecting an iPhone to play music etc  which was the reason for looking in a lot of different options for my car and decided to go with the Alpine   7    Apple iPod  Ready   In Dash Deck   Black I love how Apple Car Play works in general  It feels like using your iPhone directly in your car  The hands free talking works great and the microphone is providing good sound to the person on the other end of the line There are a few things I want to mention that are useful to know before purchasing this system  It will only connect your phone via usb lightning cable  There is no bluetooth option available for your iphone which I would prefer  I would also like Apple Car Play to come out with an update that integrates Apple Music and the availability to search for songs and play them 
When I bought my HTNT5 I wanted to add speakers to the rear in my living room  These have worked perfectly  A little high on the price point but ultimately worth it  Sonys app left something to be desired but once I got the surround setup it has worked great  I haven t had any difficulties maintaining connectivity 
I was looking for something that would work with the surface pro and didn t tell wanna have to worry about compatibility issues  This works for me 
The keyboard makes a great addition to the already wonderful Surface Pro 4  It should be standard issue with the SP
works great  was perfect for a meeting and taking the minutes 
These Speakers were a great add on to the HTNT5 Sound bar  Once you get them linked and working The sound is amazing  The Suround sound needs to be relinked if you turn off the surround bar  I suggest using the app rather then having to do it through the remote and pressing buttons all the time  It doesn t seem to remember the devices if you turn off the Suround Sound Profile  Would be nice to be able to turn it on and off without having to Relink all the time
I originally considered just using my bluetooth keyboard instead of paying  160 for this because i thought it would be awful to use  But after purchasing this i was very surprised by how much i like typing on this keyboard  The key travel isn t very deep since it is so thin but i really enjoy the tactile feel and sound of it  The fingerprint scanner was the main reason i chose this version over the normal version and it works well most of the time  sometimes need to to be cleaned before it is able to read   I only have two gripes  One is that the model with the fingerprint scanner is only available in black and i really wanted the gray alcantara model  The second is the keys and scanner shows oils from your fingers a lot more that keyboards that i have owned in the past and gets tranferred onto the screen when closed 
The Geek Squad recommended this as they were helping to revamp my laptop  Not only it is running more smoothly but it is faster and runs smoothly  I highly recommend it 
I was hesitant because I thought this couldn t compare to a PCI Express analog  but I m relieved that it performs great 
The wonderful staff set me up with exactly what I needed  The product works great 
This was a pleasant surprise  I have not had any experience with USB wireless adapters  This one is fast and reliable  and was a breeze to set up 
Used this recharger on an all day hike  Worked like a champ and I never ran out of battery power while using Noom Walk to track my steps as well as Map My Walk 
Easy to set up and use  Helps to protect the computer too
Helped so much to maximize volumn for people w hearing loss
This is a great accessory for my tablet  Great purchase

Does its job  I can watch the tv anywhere I want  App should be better though
Good and basic  Great for watching tv away from home 
Great product for my office needs  Best used in smaller area 
I haven t had to use it too much but it is great in case of emergency or long trips with no charger
If you don t use CDs any more this product is good
It�s really good and want to recommend friend to buy it
The sound is so loud instantly fell in love only down sides are the charger cable is verrrry unique so you must take care of it and battery life is a bit low b  c of internet   Bluetooth usage other than that it�s great
This is a great pair of headphones    Could be a little louder but still a good product 
This is another great headunit buy alpine  All the features work as they should  I hope they provide updates in the future  Maybe wireless CarPlay

I love this bag  It carries well  Holds a lot of stuff for a small bag 
I was having such a hard time finding this in stores  I was so glad I finally did find them at Best Buy and best of all for such a great prize 
It is great has about 3 to 4 days of active use  the cord is braided
Just starting buying these for Surfaces  They work well 
Love not having to sign in just using a finger print makes it so much easier  Great product 
Love this thing    hard to setup but great support
One control makes my total system much easier to use 
Overall Great sound and the price wasn t too bad either
Paired with the Sony NT5 sound bar  this is the ultimate theater set up  for a fraction of the price of Sonos  What s better is I can move this speaker and use it anywhere I want for music listening  Highly recommended 
Plays a great beat  makes me want to dance on my feet 
Sound fantastic  They get loud  They look good  Yes  Buy them 
Speaker bumps  Bass is nice  good sound quality  Better than my last one and for half the price  Definitely worth it 
Speakers are very good Not very expensive sounds is good
They did the job right  work great with my camera 
This is a great keyboard  Better than my laptop  I highly recommend this product 
This portable speaker is great  great sound  and it is so small
This remote is amazing  It is super easy to set up and it is super easy to use I highly suggest getting one to anyone that has any sort of entertainment center
This was a replacement  Not puppy proof  I would highly recommend 
This Wi Fi works great we can run 7 item no problem with speed glad I did the up grade
Tried Bose of similar price   20 more   but Sony had better bass quality  and sound volume  it is water resistant and pairing is very easy  iPhone   Mac  Great price  great product 
Works fine Bluetooth works great  Little hard to figure the Bluetooth out at first but no problem after you get it
Works great in a second room and on the go  Definitely worth the money 
Works very good  Charge lasts long  Used in several cities  hotels    air ports  Secure 
works well  I need 50 charaters so  it does it s job making my computer wireless
Ive had almost every apple tablet made and finally am trying the Surface Pro 4  For the first time i found a keypad that fits my hands  But even better is that i can add fingerprint ID capabillity to the security of facial recognition  on starjup  and password just in case  Id have to go braindead to not be able to use this computer  further  it allows for full access for my wife and loved ones for critical information should something happen to me  morbid  sure  but a well thought out design none the less 
These are great speakers  with crisp tones and decent bass  Definitely recommend installing under an eave to direct bass for better resonation
LOVE this remote  So easy to use that my mom can now operate her electronics by herself  Mind you I had to do the initial install 
Got this for my 92 year old grandma as a gift  I was a little nervous she would have trouble using it  but to my surprise she figured it out 
when I saw the reviews on here that were nearly a full 4  4 stars from 41 different people  I bought a few pairs for my Saturn Ion   a HUGE upgrade from the factory speakers  very satisfied  if you need an affordable sound upgrade for your car   get 2 pairs while they re still on sale   best speakers for the price
fantastic device but big and bulky for a wifi usb device
i am using the gpx555 in a small commercial kitchen  it is a foregone conclusion that the acoustics are horrendous  moreover there are oven hoods  stoves  and hot and cold tables whooshing and rattling  machines spinning and making egregious screeching noises  fans blowing  buzzers doorbells and phones going off  and people shouting and cursing at each other and etc the gpx555 has pretty good overall sound reproduction quality and plenty of volume even in this less than ideal setting  the volume control is stepless and increments in single values from 0 50  of course somebody had to mash it all the way up within seconds of the thing being plugged in  with some kind of pantera or slipknot or ratm crap  it sounded very loud  very good  and there was no discernible clipping or distortion  this lasted only a few seconds as it was much too loud  which is a good thing   and we settled on 35 for the rest of night  as loud as possible while still being able to communicate using raised voices  which everyone has to do anyway to be understood irrespective of any superficial tertiary electronically engendered harmonic dissonance i was allocated a budget of 400usd and the only other unit i considered was the samsung mx js5000 for around 300usd because it had so many reviews  however again and again i heard people complaining about the lack of bass so i decided to go with the gpx555 because it had a dedicated 10 inch subwoofer the only space i have available is on top of one of the coolers about 8 feet above the ground  i know from past experience that subwoofer placement can have a significant effect on the amount of bass that is output but floor space is at a premium and even if there was a corner of the floor available the proprietary cords that connect the head unit to all three speakers preclude the use of any normal monster cable extension perhaps it is because the subwoofer is high above the ground and not near a corner  but i am really disapointed with the low frequency bass response  granted i didnt have very high expectations for an all in one shelf stereo priced at circa 380usd  but i was hopeful  read  naive  that the dedicated 10 inch subwoofer this unit touted which differentiated it from its peers would deliver some facsimile of accurate bass response unfortunately at least in my location and application the low end just isnt there at all  contrariwise  there is some weak muddy midrange and high range bass to be sure  but i know the music i like well enough to really miss the low thunderous bass hits that should drop  i tried out some 2pac only god can judge me now and wonda why they call u bitchsic  some stevie ray vaughan riviera paradise  little wing and chitlins con carne  some bob marley time will tell and some ratatat songs from the album classics all of these songs have some nice low frequency bass that hits you in the chest and rattles the walls and windows when it drops on a system with a capable subwoofer  but i did not hear any of the lowest bass while using this gpx555  by way of comparison another system i owned was comprised of some affordable recertified harman kardon separates i e  a 2 channel receiver for 150usd  two bookshelf speakers for 150usd and a 12 inch powered subwoofer for 150usd and while certainly not spectacular i could at least hear the lowest of the low bass  i am of the opinion that you really cant get a decent subwoofer for under 400 or 500usd so i had no delusions about that recertified stuff  but it was in my price range and whilst it didnt play the lowest notes very loud  they were definitely audible with the gpx555 i just didnt hear the notes from entire frequency ranges at the low end  i do not know the exact cutoff at the low end where it can no longer reproduce the notes  but if you have ever used winamp and played around with its 10 band equalizer  where the lowest slider is 70hz and the highest is 16khz then you may grasp that what i am speculating is that nothing below say 250hz or 180hz or somewhere around there is being reproduced for frame of reference i listen to most of my music on a pair of sennheiser hd650 headphones with lossless flac shn or wav source output through winamp and i always finetune winamps 10 band eq into a sort of V shape with the lowest and highest sliders almost at max and then each slider between those two progressively lower such that the slider for 1khz in the very middle is almost all the way down at the center of the V shape and what i can tell you is that the low notes in these songs i mentioned  those which are below the 180hz  2nd lowest  slider on the eq all hit hard and boomy and sound great on my headphones  and as such i anticipated hearing those notes from the 10inch subwoofer on the gpx555 but they just weren t there  i should point out that when using the gpx555 in this kitchen in addition to the sub optimal placement of the subwoofer  i am also not using a lossless audio source nor am i playing it through winamp and its 10 band eq everybody just puts on youtube videos which i believe are all manner of lossy  and that flash or html5 player or whatever it is has no equalizer that i am aware of  and of course the left and right audio composite patch cord running from the computer to the gpx 555 is not gold plated  low guage  or nitrogen purged etc etc ad nauseam ad infinitum  ergo these shortcomings are indubitably degrading the sound quality what i *have* done though  is to make sure that sonys bass boost  which on this unit they call bass bazuka or some inane crap  is turned on  and it does in fact make a very noticeable difference   when it is off there is absolutely no low end at all  when it is on there is a decentish   amount of muddy midrange and high range bass this unit also has a dedicated control to adjust the level of the subwoofer itself  from 0 10db and i have this as high as it will go  there are also around 10 built in eq presets available which i have tried in an effort to get the bass to hit  you know that feeling you get in your chest when the bass drops  but i still am not hearing the lowest notes it also has a custom eq setting which consists of only three bands that are not labeled with their numerical hz value  only low mid and high  i have manually set this as close as possible to the V shape i use in winamp with the low and high at max and the mids near minimum and this is the configuration i used to test the songs i mentioned as far as build quality goes the sony gpx 555 is very plasticky and extremely lightweight for its size  now maybe headunit and speaker technology has changed since the time i picked up that hk stuff  but i was surprised at how light the speakers and headunit were considering their size and cost  maybe the weight of the magnet is no longer a necessary and sufficient variable to solve the equation for quality all of the controls on this thing are ridiculously oversized  chintzy and not particularly tactile or sturdy feeling  i guess you could say they are all soft touch type buttons that have a lot of give it has a decent size display with graphics that look like something out of an alpine car audio headunit from 1995  the volume nob is the size of a grapefruit for some unknown reason  much too big  the face of the headunit and the cone of each speaker and the subwoofer all have led lighting the color and pattern of which can be changed or disabled entirely  honestly i would prefer it if sony had reallocated the costs accrued by this gimmicky nonessential lightshow into higher quality audio components on the headunit and speakers in an effort to provide better audio quality at the same cost one of the selling points for us was that this unit was bluetooth and near field communication capable and somebody figured out how to get their phone to talk to it pretty easily so now they can control basically all the settings and choose the music at the cost of their data plan  it also comes with a small remote that is seemingly bereft of a mute button but replete with two aaa batteries as stated previously the speaker wires are a  too short  i e  6ft maybe idk  b  have no speaker posts and c  use a proprietary connector that looks more like an ethernet jack than any else something else i noticed  and again maybe this is just the way speakers have evolved  is that the actual woofer cones on the speakers and subwoofer do not move at all when music is playing  the cones on every other set of speakers i have owned move in and out in time with the notes and the distance traveled increases in direct proportion to the volume level all in all i would say that if you dont care about low frequency bass  assuming that my inability to properly locate the subwoofer on the floor in a corner is not entirely responsible  then you would be pretty happy with this unit because it does sound reasonably nice and has plenty of volume  pretty flashing lights  bluetooth  eq presets and a  rudimentary  custom eq  and yes it looks sleek and black and shiny and sexy from the front  the particle board from the rear is a little disconcerting  notwithstanding the veracity of that antiquated adage re breaking speakers in effects an amelioration of thier phonic capabilities  headphone freaks swear by this but i didnt notice anything change with mine  i will be unequivocally verklempt if  after a few weeks of 15 hour per day usage  i throw on some aphex twin selected ambient works and am magically blown away by the earth shattering low frequency bass drops vis a vis richard d  james s irrefuteably gekkenhuis genius  we are the music makers  and we are the dreamers of the dreams  all of these moments will be lost  like tears in rain  godspeed 
My father has over 6 remotes to control all the devices at home  This unifies them into one and it is easy to use  You can change the language and personalize icons  commands  etc  You can add the hub to have reach past cabinets and control Bluetooth devices  but he did not need that 
Wasn t too surprised at the sound they put out  but its much better than stock  If I had the chance I would go back and spend a bit more  especially if they are going in the front  I plan on upgrading them when I have money 
Great speakers  I was just WoW when turned on after a simple install  Sound quality is natural and clear  This is not for a Boom system     this is quality not quantity  Good luck 
Got it on sale for a great price gave it to my mom to use for her alexa dot works just fine 
Highly recommend this product for those who want to see cable tv from their mobile or tablet device 
This keyboard is necessary for the device  It should have come free with the device 
The system is very slow for some reasons  It works well for the money spent  however  I bought a Sony many years ago and the design was more solid and the aesthetics was much more pleasing  This system looks very plastic and cheap and significantly slow in processing inputs  I am not particularly impressed with the wattage of the speakers as I was more interested in the purity of the sound not how loud it can go  Sony should stop competing with the Panasonics and rather try to produce quality materials like Bose 
Good TV for that spare bedroom or game room but not as your main TV 
Nothing fancy  but works well  Does not play audio cds however  If that is important to you then this is not for you 
Good product  easy to setup  battery life isn t amazing but not bad either 
I recieved this XB30  in exchange for my honest review   Not impressed with the sound from this bluetooth speaker  It has a Bassy   Dull sound to it  For 150 00  it Lacks Highs badly    For example  I have a 40 00 Phillips bluetooth speaker   SBT300   that plays Clearer than this Sony  Also  the 40 00 Phillips  is 3x larger than this SRS XB30 Sony  While the Sony has decent Bass  it truely lacks High frequencies  Highs  come across muddy If you like Bass  and leds  this bluetooth speaker module is for you  If you like clear high frequencies  as I do  I reccommend skipping this  Id rather have better performing Speakers  vs the flashing and color changing leds I do like that rhis has a rechargable battery  built in  You can also plug your phone or mp3 player directly into this for audio  via 3 5mm adapter  As well as charging  via supplied usb rear input 
I bought these at half price and they sound good  but not great  My Beats solo 3 sound better

I like it  but the KB needs to be backlit  Can t use unless there is enough light
The UE Megablast is the newest arrival to the UE lineup to offer fantastically crisp and clear audio with strong bass response  with the new addition being the Amazon Alexa voice assistant  With a sleek cylindrical design  waterproofing that allows the speaker to be submersible  and omnidirectional speaker output  the UE Megablast aims to be the only speaker that you need in the home  at the pool  at the party  and everywhere in between  What�s In the Box? A box with a lot of funky and groovy art  you�ll know what I mean when you slide off the tame looking cover  UE Megablast speaker Quick Start Guide Micro USB cable USB ChargerAppearance and Build Quality  The all cylindrical design looks very similar to an oversize beer can with a rugged  rubberized exterior shell to handle all the scrapes  bruising  and drops that will occur over its lifetime  The speaker is covered in a hard  fabric like grill to allow the audio to pass through the two 25mm tweeters  two 55mm drivers  and two 85mm x 50mm passive radiators  all the while keeping dust  moisture  and water from seeping into the interior  On the bottom of the speaker is a circular rubber cover protecting the micro usb port for charging  There is also a removable D ring underneath the speaker  I assume this D ring is for hanging the speaker  Up top is the power button and another much smaller button to enable Bluetooth pairing  The very oversized      buttons are located along the sides of the cylinder  The button labels for   and � are huge  you�d have to be blind not to notice them  And maybe it is just me  but they do have the visual appearance of resembling a religious cross  Features  Rugged Design � Take the speaker anywhere indoors and outdoors  but of course don�t subject it to extreme heat or cold   Omnidirectional sound Up to 16 hrs battery life � more than enough for a full day of partying assuming you get 8 hrs of sleep to round out a 24 hr day  It will take up to 3 hrs to recharge a fully discharged battery   IP67 rating � This means this speaker goes beyond simply being cowardly splash proof  but boldly insists on being dunked under water in approximately 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes  I was too afraid to put this to the test  since I did not want to ruin a  300 speaker  I�ll take UE at their word  Strong Bluetooth connection  I didn�t experience any Bluetooth stuttering or disconnections  In fact  UE boasts that the Bluetooth range is up to 150 feet   Wifi music streaming from IHeartRadio  Amazon Prime Music  and TuneIn Radio through Amazon Alexa  Pandora and Deezer are purportedly to be included in the future   Integrated Amazon Alexa voice assistant  This may or may not be important to you depending on whether or not you are already subscribed to one of the two dominant voice assistant ecosystems  Amazon Alexa  Google Assistant  presently available in the market  Features that are Missing  Equally important to the features  aka �the selling points�  are the features that are missing in the UE Megablast which are offered by some of the competitors in the portable Bluetooth speaker market  No NFC connection   No 3 5mm audio jack  I am disappointed  but not surprised  Would have been great if UE included a 3 5mm jack since wired audio quality is still better than Bluetooth transmission audio quality   You cannot connect two or more UE Megablasts together or to other speakers in the UE lineup via Bluetooth in a party mode to have multiple speakers playing the same music simultaneously  Not sure why UE took this feature off the table  Just imagine how loud your party could get if you could connect them together  Audio Quality  I was impressed by the audio output of the speakers  The omnidirectional  aka 360 degree  sound meant that there are no fading  audio dead spots as I moved about my room  The UE Megablast can get really loud to the point that your neighbors will be knocking on your door to turn it down  The mid range representing vocals and speech is very crisp and clear  The highs are equally well represented  Bass kicks in strong without overpowering the high and midrange frequencies  This means that when you�re listening to music with strong bass  you can still clearly hear the vocals  And if you choose to watch a movie using the UE Megablast  you can clearly hear the bass response from action sequences  but wouldn�t have to adjust equalizers to hear dialogue  Amazon Alexa Voice Assistant  I�m not going to go too much into this  You are initially asked to connect to Amazon Alexa when you first set up the speaker through the Ultimate Ears app available through the Google Play Store or Apple App store  The microphone does a fine job of picking up audio across my room and I�m able to ask Alexa questions and give it commands  Alexa will only work if the speaker is connected through the wifi network  It will not work on a Bluetooth only connection If you find yourself desiring some privacy  you have two options to turn off the microphone from listening to your conversation  First method is to open the Ultimate Ears app  tap on the microphone icon  and tap �off� to disable the microphones  A tone will be emitted and a small red light will illuminate at the top of the speaker to indicate that the microphones have been turned off  The second method is to use the speaker controls  On the speaker  press the volume down � � � and the Bluetooth button simultaneously  You will hear a tone and see the red light at the top of the speaker  This indicates that the microphone has been turned off  To turn them back on  press the same buttons again  Finally  one thing to take note  UE did a poor job with the location for the micro usb charging port  The port is located at the bottom base of the speaker  That means when you are charging it  you will have to place the speaker on its side horizontally  which means it has a strong chance of rolling off your table  Or you can place the speaker upside down  with the power button on the bottom  The only other alternative is to purchase the charging dock which will allow you to charge the speaker in the upright position  Conclusion  Do I recommend the UE Megablast? Given its very good audio quality and sleek  rugged build quality  I totally believe it is a sound choice  pun intended  and should be on your short list  However  given that some of the features are noticeably missing which were found in the previous UE lineup  eg  Megaboom  at a lower price point  you will need to really ask yourself if the addition of the Alexa assistant is worth the tradeoff 
Theyre good  fast and doing exactly like they should  The first one had a hardware fault at about 17 20 days  I have 4 sticks all working well 
Does good job with normal tv  dvd  vcr  media storage  etc  Will turn on  off Roku but does not handle the misc functions  Still have to use Roku remote for that 
This thing is a pain in the but to setup  I love it  but it s awkward setup system leaves more to be desired Pros Works with all my devices so far  except ps4 Good rangeVery customizable Cons Lags like crazy on Roku  Like almost an entire second after each press  I can t seem to fix it Setup is clunky  Can t change keys on device  you have to do this on the computer every time  Seems like one a device is added you should be able to customize on the fly 
very good but sometimes  can t connect to the wifi  i have to reboot
not to bad for the price  you have to be pretty close to the router though to get a great signal
Great for wireless sound and noise cancelling  Heavier than beats and it takes some adjustment to the weight 
Easy to setup and connect to existing network  I did disconnect and reconnect multiple times but seems stable now  On the upper end of adaptors but overall everything works good 
Much better radio than my previous one  Programmable for your area  and has a good loud alert 
I needed something to have outside by the pool and in the heat so I decided to do this one because it was on sale  So far so good I barely have to turn it up for it to be loud and works through all the splashes  Wish it had skip and rewind buttons on the actual unit but my phone is never too far 
This Motorola Pet Scout66 Wi Fi HD Pet Monitoring Camera gives you a good deal for your money right now with everything being free  To begin with the nicely compact Video Camera will give you a pretty good picture similar to HD with it s 720p screen  The camera also has digital zoom  infrared night vision which provided a pretty good picture in a completely black room and even gives you room temperature display and alerts The two way communication provides ample sound  It s nice when you can both hear what is going on in a room as well as speak to whoever is in the room  Motorola is calling this a pet video camera  but in actuality  this would make a great security camera as well  Can you imagine pointing this inside your door  seeing a burglar and speaking to them I m sure when you inform them that the police are on the way  they won t hang around too long To use this Wi Fi video camera  all you need is a Smartphone or Tablet  and if you want to be able to view also on your PC  you will need at least Windows 7 or Mac OS 10 7  along with Chrome 24  Internet Explorer 9  Safari 6 or Java 7  I have Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 9 and can view everything perfectly  There is a Quick Set Up that literally anyone can do in a couple of minutes  You simply plug the camera in  get your Smartphone or Tablet and download the Hubble for Motorola Monitors App from either the App Store for iOS devices or from the Google Play Store for Android devices  Run the Hubble for the App on your Smartphone or Tablet  follow the instructions to create your account  then log in and you are ready to access your live camera stream The set up is really a breeze  but should you have any problems  there is a really thorough User s Guide  and if you need more help  there is an 888 number for a live customer service rep to help you  I had a problem with the camera connection  and found the easy fix in the User s Guide  My LED on the camera was slow blinking  but when the guide said to move it closer to the router  it worked perfectly The important thing I have to tell anyone setting up your App account for this camera is to read everything during set up  I found out while reading that while there is now FREE motion and detection and Alert and FREE In App Video Recording  it will not always be free in the future  I read that the still photos from the camera will always be free  but the videos will not  Also  as with all things from the internet floating free in space that can be stolen  the photos and videos streaming out there are encrypted for security and can only be accessed through your password  so they are as safe as they can be  But  it seems as though it wouldn t be a bad idea to turn off your camera when you are home though for your own privacy All in all this is a nicely priced Wi Fi Video camera with a good picture and sound  and with everything being pretty secure with it s encrypted pictures and your password protection  it s giving you a good deal  but I would love to know when the FREE motion detection and alert and FREE video recording will change to NOT FREE  what will it cost me then This is a good 4 Star Camera  as my still photos will always be free  but if I should want the video of a burglar robbing my home  how much will that cost me Until I know the future costs of the video recordings  this camera is only 3 Stars 
Good resolution   good performance overall
Got this for my daughter for first set of headphones  Easy to use and fit great on her 
Works as expected  Using 2 in raid 1  Silent  fast  and reasonable cool 
This is the third Bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers  However the other two have price points higher than this Sony XB30 with a  149 99 MSRP  one is  50 higher and the other is  100 higher  The Sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear  the back one is for a passive radiator   The unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece  The front grille is surrounded by a light bar that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes  none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played  The light show variations cannot be accessed directly from the speakers built in controls  you have to make changes from the SongPal app  which is free   but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker  The jacks for power  audio in  and USB connection  to charge your phone from the speaker  are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is IPX5 rated for water resistance  Note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromised The Extra Bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it  leaves the speaker sounding kind of tinny or thin when it is turned off  I did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from iTunes via my iPhone 6 and when connected with a cable to an iPod Classic playing Apple Lossless files  The SongPal app has a rudimentary three band graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass  midrange and treble from flat to  10 or  10 with three sliders  The bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content I listened to  but the treble control had virtually no effect that I could tell Two features I was not able to try out were the Wireless Party Chain since I have only one Sony speaker and the LDAC audio technology which is a higher quality Bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary Sony technology available on their ZX2 High Resolution Audio Walkman and Xperia smartphones I realize I am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age  but I am a little confused by the combination of the multicolored line light and flashing strobe that would have probably appealed to the 12 year old me along with the LDAC technology that comes in a  1200 hi res music player that the 60 year old me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing  I would expect someone with a high resolution  audiophile quality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than this The XB30 has a built in microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speaker  mic  Sound quality was far superior to the iPhones speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation  to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices   This feature helps the XB30 earn a place on your work desk I think the XB 30 represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other Bluetooth speakers I am familiar with  however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing  at least to me  Sound quality can be a rather subjective matter  and to be fair I was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a LDAC capable device  There are many other players at this price level  so I suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision

great product that is value priced and very competitive against other market sources
Good value smaller TV for the price nice picture and good quality
I purchased this primarily for the hands free bluetooth interface  It fills the need if you aren t looking for premium audio 
Needed more memiry for my new computer and this filled the bill
I m sure there are over the ear headphones that are better than these with better base response  but for the price  these have good sound and are an excellent value  They are on ear  but the cushion is nice and soft  I can wear them for longer extended periods and my ears don t get irritated  Plus they are smaller and more light weight than most over the ear almost like they are not there  Noise cancelling is good as I wear them at work and can barely hear nearby conversations  I have yet to have any issues with the Bluetooth pairing on iDevices  Android  or computers  with the exception of a Sony PS4   Unfortunately  Sony only accepts a very limited  proprietary Sony headphones for their device   These headphones give you built in voice feedback telling you  Power on   or  Power off    Device connected    Battery high  low   etc   Additionally you can control some playback functions  volume  and they can act as a wireless phone headset  They come with an optional audio cord  a charging cable  and a pouch to carry it all in  With these you get good sound  decent noise cancelling  corded and cordless connectivity  and they are small and lightweight  all at a very affordable price 
Used 1 stick in each of my mining rigs  Decent price and could use 1 stick in each rig 
I would definitely recommend this product to upgrade your computer 
Good remote overall  Must use computer with internet connection to program  Poor battery life between charges 
Compatible with all of my devices  even some older equipment  For some reason  Apple TV was NOT one of the devices to choose from  I was able to set it up a generic device though I do miss having the channel numbers  0 9  as buttons  but all in all  good remote 
It was more difficult getting the various models of TV  receiver  etc  than entering the information  Looking forward to long term usage 
I was a little disappointed it did not come with everything we needed  We bought it to replace another that had started giving us trouble  so we had all the RFID transponders  This one has never worked as well as the first  It will not turn on all the devises at once  We have to go to the  help menu  to finally get all the devises on 
Love the flexibility of the remote  Dislike the touchscreen  it is super sensitive if you accidently brush it  you end up redirected 
Microsoft did a phenomenal job creating a Type Cover that has decent key travel and a good track pad  The fingerprint sensor works well and makes it easier to quickly get into the OS 
Good price for a 50 inch TV  Bright  vibrant colors  and clear display  Exactly the high quality you d expect from Samsung electronics My only  minor  issues   Every time I turn TV on  or it gets automatically turned on because a connected HDMI device is activated  cool feature btw   there is this annoying pop up menu for selecting a built in TV app or something  I never use this  and I either have to wait for the menu to disappear after several seconds or manually close the menu myself by pressing RETURN on the remote  I d rather this menu never pop up at all   The TV has built in Wi Fi  and apps   which is nice  but during Wi Fi setup  there is a completely irrational password length limit that makes no sense whatsoever  My Wi Fi network has a long password  over 32 characters  don t ask   and I can t connect to it on this TV because the password entry field has a hard limit for the length of characters you can type  I dunno the exact limit  but it s obviously less than 32 characters  Why this is a thing bamboozles me as they should have just followed the specification on what the maximum password length is for Wi Fi connections  but whatever I don t use my TV for Wi Fi anyway  so it s a minor issue  I have a connected Fire TV for streaming  and at least THAT device allows for 32 length Wi Fi network passwords  
Great TV  good picture  etc  BUT A WORD OF WARNING  and it may not be a big deal for everyone  however  In trying to connect the TV to my network and entering password  the  smart  tv is telling me the wifi password is incorrect  I know the password  confirmed it many times  After calling customer service  they asked if my password had any unique characters  it does  and they told me the TV will not allow for special characters in a password to be able to connect  This is a huge inconvenience  going to have to change every device in my house for this TV   not too mention a matter of security  the more random numbers and characters the better   I am shocked that Samsung knows this and won t make any kind of change  I almost want to return the TV just based on that fact and the fact that security should be paramount to any company that deals with internet and privacy 
Good TV with excellent color and WiFi works good  Sound is not quite up to my expectation  hence only 4 stars 
Good TV and very easy set up  Didn�t like the stand   think it was for a larger model butit was an �open box   excellent�?  Center swivel stand  foot would be better but I ended up buying one 
as always samsung tv s are very good products and long lasting
Haven t had any problems with it  Works well  Good for the price
I really like the tv but the base is so wide I had to rearrange my furniture 
Not being able to use a universal remote  X1 digital remote  to control the TV kinda sucks
God Tv                                                 
Reliable tv  Perfect size for my kids room  Samsung is amazing  
this is a good tv sound is good picture quality is alright could have a little more color I like it 
Tv meets my needs  Use antenna and Netflix only  Good tv 
Very good picture  Easy to set up the base  Control buttons on tv are easy to use 
Easy setup Good tv for smaller room  very good picture 
Very good TV for the price  Nice upgrade from tube type 
Very happy with purchase   it s the perfect size for my bedroom 
This isn t a carry all of your gear type of bag but perfect for travel  The bag opens from the inside for added security and that s a nice bonus 
Works well to watch the dog in his pen  Would be happy if it was in color consistently 
Even though they say its great  its not so good because you still have dead zones   more than you think   and you ALWAYS have to lug this thing around    its not very small so it doesn t fit in your pocket so good   it bulges out and is just inconvenient  They should make it so it can fit in your wallet like a credit card so you can carry it all the time   yes   it does get forgotten on the charger when i leave the house    Oh and the screen gets cracked VERY EASILY   I just bought this thing and already its cracked   i have for 2 more years   can t imagine how times it will crack   make sure you get a warrenty on it 
For what we are needing for our entertainment system  it is working well  Would probably give it a 4 5 if I could 
I use this for my old video camera and they do the job well  I love that I can still buy tapes for the camera 
Inexpensive tapes if you have a DVC camcorder  Good quality 
It s a good system for the house to entertain  It s loud enough for a house party or just to relax listening to music  The wire connections are a bit short and are not detachable and as such the speakers have to be close to the system  Blue tooth technology make it easy to listen to your favourite music on your iPod or phone or other device  The volume is kind of low when the phono  tune in is utilized  I attach my turntable to the system to listen to my old vinyl records   Overall  it is a good buy 
Good speakers for my application and situation  Did not need to shake down the house  Good quality sound 
Nice system with good components  It has decent graphics capability 
This is a pretty good speaker for the price  I use it when I take showers and it s loud and clear 
I bought two ZR7 speakers to pair with my HTNT5 sound bar  They are very nice speakers that function very well as surrounds  The Sony app that sets up surrounds and updates the software on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired  but the speakers are very good to pair with the Sony soundbar
I bought this to upgrade my MacBook Pro  So far so good 
Have installed it on my Honda Accord 2001 and haven t gotten anything problematic with it  Would definitely recommend it  My head unit is still factory one so I couldn t really enjoy it 
This PNY Anarchy DDR4 memory kit gives your desktop a boost  operating at 2400MHz for fast multitasking and browsing About cheaper than those famous big brand but still works good
Good quality with 10 Mbps internet connection speed  Quality is dependent on network speed  Good product for the price
Bought specifically for usage when I am at another location without TV  don t want to spend the money   Combined it with a Roku at the remote location and works well  No need to spend the extra money for TV service  Only draw back was that it is HTMI only  So you would need to make sure your cable and TV has HTMI slots 
I used these to store files by subject not all in one
My old Netgear AC1200 wireless adapter wasn t getting the speed  i decided to try the Netgear AC1900 it gave me faster speed with no other network chances  i have it hooked to a laptop
Been wanting to install some speakers on my patio for a while  and picked these up from Magnolia  BestBuy on sale a couple months ago  They sound great and were pretty easy to install  I already had speaker wire run to the patio   It does not come with mounting hardware  so you have to pick up some screws and  or anchors from a hardware store  but the instructions does recommend what to get and how to install based on the type of wall to which you are mounting the speakers  The bracket separates from the speaker and is mounted to the wall first  The bracket is lightweight and easy to handle  so installing was a breeze  Then you attach the speakers to the bracket which was also very easy  I also like that the speakers can be tilted to optimally direct the sound 
Nice fit and finish  at low volume there is some noticeable distortion with the bass but overall a decent speaker with lots of features 
We got these on clearance and work exactly how we want them  Great bargain 
These are good speakers for the price  They sound great
Replaced factory speakers in Mustang and produces much clearer sound and better bass with the new radio I had installed 
I am not into car speakers at all but my front speakers went out in my car so I was looking for something with good sound quality that would not cost me a fortune  I like the Alpine speakers the best because I like a lot of bass when listening to music and it seems these had the best bass quality without paying an arm and leg for it  I have had them for little over a month now and I am pleasantly pleased with them  If you are big into car audio  you would probably want something better  but these are fine for me and my Pontiac G6 
Bought the speakers to replace the speakers in my car  They fit perfect and sound good too
Good speakers  very attractive  Excellent sound  It would be nice if they would supply them with the mounting kit for a wall 
I have these speakers as part of my living room 5 1 set up  I have used the same speakers for all 5 channels  So far i am happy with the purchase  The speakers sound good when paired with a receiver  I have played music on high volume and these really rocked the house 
Nice and loud good base I have no complaints with these speakers  
The speakers look great on the ceiling and sound great The only problem I am experiencing is that they are connected as  Speaker B  to provide a multi room stereo sound however I cannot control their volume separately  so they sound a bit quieter than I want them to  but when I play them separately they sound great 
We put these speakers into a Chevrolet Silverado truck  Definitely made a difference  Good sound for the money 
easy to set up and good sound  For the money you can t beat it 
Good after market speakers and the sound is noticeable 
Good sounding speakers  Worth paying the extra few bucks for better sound
Got these for my sons focus  They are a lot betters than the ones that were in there 
Really good speakers and a good price  the are loud and easy install
I love my Sony Speaker  It was easy to pair my iphone to the speaker  The sound quality is great  The bass is awesome  LED light is fun to use but can only be used with the Sony Music Center app so you have to download the Sony Music Center app  You can also change the bass 
Good speaker for my purposes  Sound quality good for price point  Wish speakers could be paired with each other for stereo effect  Just not available with speakers at this price range 
I bought the Sony speaker specifically for its ability to be used with Chromecast Audio  While it does work and can be added to groups it does take about 30 seconds after turned on to actually show up on my android phone or ipad  Google Play Music  to actually show up  Also it seems to lose connection from time to time  but this could also be an issue with my network or that I have 5 Chromecast Audio s  Although I have a top class Orbi Router and my wifi signal shows as strong   I ve looked into google to see if there is a limit to the amount of Chromecast Audio s or simply Chromecasts that can be allowed and have not found a limit  Aside from the infrequent connection issues which I ve troubleshoot extensively the speak sounds good  It seems to hold a charge fairly well and produces enough sound to fill a small room  I would recommend this little speaker but only if you are trying to use it for Chromecast audio  That said  you could easily find a speaker that is just as loud for a good bit less  otherwise  its your best bet for built in Chromecast audio  I also would note that I find the Sony  Hi Res  is a bit of a gimmick  Unless you have a very specific Sony audio product that includes this feature you will likely never get any use out of this anytime soon  I have a various android devices including the google pixel phone as well as an iPad Pro and neither support it  *Although it is said that in the Android O update  post nougat  
I have been using it for about a week now so not sure about the  gets better with time   part of the product It surely is a really good speaker  the sound quality is really great and you can use it outdoors as well as it is very rugged and waterproof  Given its small size  it really packs a punch  Blasting 360� intensely rich sound with stunning clarity and deep  heart pounding bass  The Wi Fi  Bluetooth work well and I didnt face any connectivity issues  I have used amazon alexa on my own as well and this built in one is not as good as the original alexa  Voice commands were had to be repeated 3 4 times  Hopefully with time it will learn to recognise 
I tried out a bunch of speakers in the store before going with this one  It seemed to have the most bang for the buck for a wireless and bluetooth speaker  In the end  I brought it back  I found that it lacked definition and was a bit too heavy on the bass side when you engaged the bass boost and it was too thin when it wasn t engaged  I bought a Yamaha WX 030 instead  For me  I did not need the portable  battery powered option and the Yamaha had a far superior sound and a lot of features for about the same price 
got this for a good friend of mine and the speaker works amazing  definitely a good purchase 
These speakers sound great and the installation at Best Buy was Quick and painless 
My wife bought me this speaker as a gift for my office  Love it
This bluetooth speaker is a good choice for meetings to listen to music on other devices  It is portable and easy to carry 
Great lights which are always on when using and good for indoors    Might not give good volume outdoors   
Bought this speaker for the garden as the weather is getting nicer  Paired to our home network with no problems as well as two other devices via Bluetooth  NFC   For some reason my Sony Vaio laptop can not find it via Bluetooth but this is not a massive problem and I ll troubleshoot to see if that can be fixed Sounds really good for it s small size  but loses a star because I would of liked to have seen it designed with an LED display  which I knew it did not have before buying 
The only downside is the short distance that you have to maintain between the music source a the speaker 
good sound  we have two  I like the lights off feature and the add bass 
I think it could be a little better but you get what you pay for  Bluetooth is hard to connect to at time but it works well 
I m not very demanding with this sort of item  not being an audiophile and all  and I wasn t expecting greatness in this price range  However  I was pleasantly surprised  This speaker isn t going to compete with one costing 10 times as much  but from my point of view  it provides perfectly acceptable sound  Good battery life too 
It was a great sounding little speaker  Maybe to many features for the average bluetooth buyer  But If your into HIFI this speaker is for you
This speaker was easy to set up and sounds great  Good for a pseudo technophobe like me 
Works great  I use it when grilling outside  I can also answer calls on it if they ring in 
Nice little speaker that packs a punch and isn t bulky or heavy
Very easy setup  Good sound  easy to connect to other speakers  and pretty good range  about 100 feet without obstructions 
this bag is fitting my camera plus 3 lenses and accessories  good for trips when you need all you stuff together 
Sony makes great sounding speakers  but the Songpal app needs update
Great for a room  I prefer a bit more base but it has a good sound clarity and battery life   Connects many devices without having to remove any  Long distance connection
My husband bought these to replace the stock speakers in my Dodge Durango  They sound good with my stock stereo 
my first Yamaha speakers and i m not disappointed  if you plan to install them in a wall beware that even if the wall has a full 2X4 it won t fit  i had to make a box of sorts to add depth so they fit   plan ahead
Good sounding speaker that projects sound clearly outside  My only observation is that the speaker is larger than most which could make it difficult to adjust unless one carefully plans its placement in advance 
I was looking for some quality Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones for my upcoming trip overseas  These are comfortable  fairly easy to set up  and have good rich sound  The app you download for your Bluetooth Source device gives you quite a bit of sound quality control  They fold up nicely and fit into a pouch which they provided 
Working well so far  Good sound  A little complicated to use  especially with Bluetooth 
The speakers sound good  clear and strong  Hope they last 
Good sound that will fill a small room  Not as bass heavy as Bose Soundlink  sound a little distorted at max volume  Great features when using Songpal app  allows for connection to Wi Fi or Bluetooth  I have occasional issues trying to reconnect to the speaker from a computer or phone via Bluetooth

I ve had the speaker for a couple of days and the sound is impressive  It does not have as much base as other speakers I own such as HK Onyx2 or Nyne Bass  but the mids and highs are very good  I love that it is waterproof so using it out on our patio is a nice bonus  This is the first product I ve owned with Alexa assistant so I m still figuring out all its capabilities  but so far it is impressive  Honestly  I think its a bit overpriced at  299 
Comfortable and good sounding headphones with good battery life  Not completely noise cancelling though 
I purchased these headphones from the BestBuy Canada website and am very satisfied with their performance and ease of use  I have been using them for ten months and they still perform flawlessly  Easy to pair with more than one device  Listen to movie audio on my laptop and take and make calls on my phone at the same time  Sound quality is good for my purposes  My only complaint is that they need to be placed on the head just right or they will fall off if I dip my chin just a little bit 
The output of this Bluetooth speaker is great  however  the battery life is terrible  Sony claims that it has a 24 hour battery life  I ve yet to get a full 12 hours from it without recharging 
Within 30 days power button failed  exchanged and they sound great     But concerned about future quality issues
This sound system was bought to add more volume to a TV  I was very satisfied with the way it increased it  The sound is very good and it was very easy to set up 
NOT BAD  NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT LOUDER BUT NOT TO BAD
They have a good sound quality but they were so tight around my ears that my ears were in pain after an hour of using the headphones  
This is a great speaker  Its sound quality is great and it can get up pretty loud 
This speaker has good sound quality but NO remote control  Remote control makes it very convenient to pause  eskip a song  etc  Users might have been expected to perform these tasks from the device the being connected to the speaker  But remote control would have been more convenient and I would have rated it 5 star  EXCELLENT  
Have always liked and used Alpine products good clean sound  many other speakers out there  Alpine is no doubt in the top three 
I wanted the Bluetooth audio feature  My phone was very easy to pair  The sound quality is good 
Easy to replace old radio on sail boat and sounds great  Bluetooth interface to iPhone simple to set up 
Just what I was looking for my small workroom  Good sound but does not take up a lot of room  I can use it for both my cds and mp3 disks 
This speaker has better sound than expected  For being this little and on the lower end of the price  it s a pretty decent speaker 
Very easy to install  Looks very nice and sound clean
Good sound just don t push it to hard will get some distortion  I would recommend these speakers 
I bought it for work and it is better than my bose 
purchased as a gift and then bought a set for myself
The Sony   HG1 Hi Res Portable Wireless Speaker provides a nice option for listening to HD  24 bit 96  192mHz  audio files  I use it with my Walkman NWZ A17  Only 4 stars because to get full hi res quality  you have to order an optional proprietary cable not available in the USA  Ordering the cable from Japan takes several weeks  Sony should offer more convenient support for it s products 
Overall a good speaker for the price  It would be better with a bass boost 
I use this thing on the river and it has good sound for being out in thebipen like that  Im very happy with it  The long battery life is great
the noise canceling worked great with bluetooth but if you want to plug in your phone or ipod it doesnt work  a mystery to me why they couldnt make it available both ways as other manufacturers did
I was looking for a wireless over the ear headphone with a high quality sound rendering then I went to try a few at local Best Buy store  I tried nearly all models available in demo to find that the JBL Everest Elite 700 had the best sound to my ears  As the in store demo songs are not of my taste  they are all chosen for the bumps  beats  oohmph and the voiceless shouting singers    I used my iPod to get some decent music and the JBL was the only one to sound natural to me with no overwhelming basses and highs  The mids were average  it sounds like something is missing in the mids   The ANC is the most annoying thing in these wireless headphones as it muffles a lot the music but a good point for this model is that the ANC is not as strong as the Bose quiet  I could not cope the white noise of the Bose models  and best of all  it is possible do disable it via the JBL app or the press of the smart button once programmed Another drawback is the weight of this thing  it is very heavy for a headphone and the ear cups are too small which brings some discomfort on the long run I do not know if my headphone has an issue but I could notice very strong and annoying scratch noises when using the headphone outdoors with ANC on while weather was a bit windy  Disabling ANC removed the issue The JBL app is a must  it is easy to use and most settings are available at hand  trutone setup  noise cancel  ambient awareness power and balance and the jewel    the EQ settings  4 default settings are available  Off  Jazz  Vocal  Bass   the possibility to create our own EQ settings The smart button can be programmed to act as ANC on  off or ambiant awareness power via the app which is very convenient The app provides also the possibility to upgrade the firmware of the headphone via bluetooth which is convenient even though I wished JBL discarded some information about the upgrade itself  what does it fix  bring? Regarding the pouch provided  I wished JBL gave some information as I discovered by accident that the headphone can be folded inward to fit the pouch 
I wanted a small unit that had great sound  This was much bigger than I was expecting  my fault for not checking measurements   Sound was great but unit is cheaply made  all plastic  CD player door finicky 
Good but didn t fit a 2015 Subaru Impreza I had the end up going with the kenwoods they fit perfect
This is a very good headphone  However  after wearing for about an hour  they start to hurt your head if you wear glasses  Good sound reproduction and noise canceling  Other than the glasses issue  highly recommend 
It packs a punch and sounds   looks good  Splash proof design is useful in the kitchen  However  i have experienced difficulty with Bluetooth connectivity using iPhone but not the iPod 
The app is excellent  Can adjust the sounds from app  But I wanted to use them for gym also  They do get a little warm with time  Fit is good  Sound is good after some adjusting from app  Battery life as advertised  Noise canceling is ok  But at price point prefer the Bose QC35 and Sennheiser Momentun 2  The app for this one better tho  Sound is good 
The sound on this speaker is good for Bluetooth  In addition  the lights that blink and change colors make it really fun
Great sound for the money  good for outside activities battery last for long time even when using the USB port to keep your phone charge
Good value Balancing sound quality and priceNot as crisp and clear as BoseBut better than JBL
The Sony XB30 has good sound for a small portable speaker 
Good sound and bass system for price  Lights are entertaining for kids
Good sounds and I also love all the options for the color display for the party features 
I ve tried a few other headphones and the one thing I like about these is the range in which you can leave the area and still receive a signal for sound  Others went away within 10 ft 
My son plays music to liking and doesn t disturd the rest of household 
Speaker overall is great looking  I enjoy the little light show it gives 
Affordability is good  Good sound  Well built  Great features
good price  sound better than what i had   they sound amazing
I live in an apartment  Great sound strong sub woofer  Sony remote is quality 
It s a nice little unit  portable easy to use and quality of sound is good
The speakers were a great replacement for the old bose and the sound is better
They have a nice fit and the sound is great  Money well spent 
This gadget is perfect to use in an apartment  It sounds great and can be used with any smartphone  I can also plug a USB drive with my favorite songs 
The Sony XB30 Portable Bluetooth Speaker is very good
Ultimate One  a very good remote  pricey  but does everything you d want in a remote and then some  Very easy to set up if you have all your product info  This remote does not include the hub  nor can you control Wii  It will let you input the Wii and turn on  off appropriate equipment but that s it  This one has a sleep timer which my old Harmony One didn t have  It s a nice feature  It s smaller than the Harmony One but feels good in hand  One issue is that without a number pad it s hard to use the remote without looking at it  It has a virtual keypad  The tactile keys are excellent and you can really feel when you press a key  All in all  it s very good  worked flawlessly the first time after set up  I may have wanted the hub so I could control everything from my IPAD  but it wasn t a deal breaker and you can always buy the hub separately  The set up program gives you an upgrade option if you buy the hub separately 
I have used several of the older Slingboxes and all have worked well but the Slingbox M2 is a great improvement  The wifi addition is a big plus 
This wall mount was an easy installment for my 60in TV  Comes with different sized screws and extenders to attach to the back of different TVs  Can be done with 1 person  but 2 people is the way to go 
Good noise cancelling and like the fact that they are wireless but can also be wired if needed  Price is reasonable  too 
Needed new router and found this one to be very affordable and easy to install  It has functioned well since installation 
it does what it is designed to do very well for    
I had a harmony 880 for almost 6 years till it broke last month  Then i purchased the  Harmony home control   That device was totally useless in its programming and user friendliness  all you could do was turn some devices on and off and adjust volume  thats it  Everything else you and to do through the app   which is a bigger disaster  Then I purchased this device  the Logitech Harmony ultimate one  It was easy to program  and wait you can control individual devices from the remote itself  Say you are listening to some music and want to change the sound settings on your receiver  all you have to do is navigate on the onscreen remote and change dolby surround to say  hall in vienna  or something  The same activity on the  logitech harmony home  is not possible and you will have to use the phone app to make the change I also like the favorite channels listed on screen and can easily toggle between channels  I really don t care that the number screen is the second or third swipe screen on the device since i rarely use it and the 50 listed favorites channels can pretty much get me what i watch Also there is a gripe that the fwd and rewind buttons are on the top of the device  That has not bothered me much at all  it takes some time getting used to but not a deal breaker 
This replacement charger is working well so far no complaints
Good product works just as well as the radio  Clear
Took me awhile to figure out how to copy all my old setup info from my old remote  The only thing that doesn t work right is the  Smart TV  setting  I have to resort to using my Samsung remote to get to the Smart hub Really upset that Logitech does not offer free telephone support  Must pay even on a new product  That s ok though because I would have to talk with someone in Pakistan anyway   
Just waiting to see if it lasts longer than the last remote  So far it seems like a good remote  The last logitech remote cradle died and logitech doesn t sell replacement cradles 
This is just a fancy all in one remote sometimes it act up and won t shut a few things off  So I returned it and stuck with my Xfinity X1 remote 
The good 1   does what you program it to  for the most part 2   good battery life3   small  lightweight and fits easily in the handThe bad 1   frequently requires multiple tries via help function or controlling devices one by one manually via devices menu to set up an activity2   can t control some devices  like Amazon Fire TV Stick     at all or some just not well  Apple TV Bottom line a good universal remote that will sometimes get it wrong
Handles a wide variety of device combinations  Touch screen controls may be accidentally selected  use locking feature to minimize bad effects   It is wise to include all available devices in each selection to allow continued operations on one device when switching to view another 
Good remote but it s very pricey for what it does  It s a basic universal remote with a touch screen  That s all  Takes some time to switch between the remote menus for each device  Getting a basic universal remote probably would ve been faster 
Remote was bought to replace an old harmony remote  it works well and has good features  The only complaint is that it is smaller than my old one and the push buttons are very close together making it easy to press the wrong button 
This remote was an upgrade for me from my original 650 Harmony  They interface is better than the originals  but the IR beam doesn t seem to be as wide  You have to be pointing right at the device to get a response  This remote does have a second IR blaster  but it s on the bottom for when you re using the touch screen  Other than that  great remote that really lives up to the Harmony name  The charger is quick and the battery lasts at least a week with normal use  Very much worth the price 
This is a upgrade remote from the harmony 650 I ve had for years  Remote is smaller than the 650 and easy to use ONCE it s been programed  Programing could be better if Logitech web programming didn t crash as much as it does  Frustrating  Sticker price shock still at  150  In all  I like the remote better than the 650 with all its new features 
Not bad   Could be better  Takes to long to program TVS and other devices  But still I think it should be cheaper  Way to much to spend money and time on this device 
big improvement from previous logitech harmony remotes 
difficult to set up  Other than that it works great
Easy set up and works great  For some it might be a little daunting with all of the functionality however once learned it will take the place of all other remotes 
Good remote but seems to struggle remembering how to switch modes on certain devices  Then again  I only had one day to work with it before I left for an extended trip so maybe when I m able to fine tune it I might see better results 
Good remote  After some use really easy to use  Had every device I have in its database  Alittle pricey though 
Great remove  Just a bit different from the 650  The touch screen is just a bit too sensitive  But as a whole it works very well  
I had no problems setting it up  except for my Boston acoustics sound bar which didn t come with a remote  It s a good remote but over priced in my opinion  I really do like it 
Love how to connects to most of my home products  Lutron light switches  Philips hue  nest products  and insteon products  Just wish it were easier to control a single device when that device didn t receive the IR signal it should have 
Overall this is a good remote  The IR transmitter is very strong  But it s easy to hit the wrong button on the touch screen  I don t like that the off button is so close to rewind as well 
This remote works for all of my needs  The only thing i don t like is the placement of the top buttons 
Works well  no to difficult to set up  didn t give it 5 stars because it s a bit pricey
I love everything about this Logitech Remote EXCEPT that the number pad is impossible to get to  Other than that it s ease of use is great for my 4 and 8 yr olds  Definitely recommend if you have children 
It was really easy to setup  I did not experience the tough setup reported by others 
We had a Logitech 1100 before this one and we loved it so when I stopped working we knew we had to get this one
The Good  Great song choices   Nice collection of Old and New Songs  My favorite Coffe House    Blend    Jazz   Easy setup for Favorite Channel  Simple to navigate with remote   I connect it with my Onkyo AVR Receiver  so sound quality gets bumped up   Great for Stereo listening The Bad   Music quality will depend on your Speakers   Will need a mini amp for quality bump up   Signal may be an issue if you dont have a open space   given signal cable is small   Low signal impacts Sound Quality 
Excellent reception  Easy to read display  Easy to operate 
I like this receiver but I wish it had a color display like the other model I looked at but got this one since it was cheaper and came with a  30 prepaid card to get 6 months for free 
Work well  no issues with post screen or problems two months out  Was the best deal at time  and was comparable to others at hogher price points at other stores 
This addition of ram doubled the speed of my laptop
Bought this to add some ram to my pc  I cant really comment on whether its better than other rams out there  I just know it does its job  now my pc has 24 ram
Looks cool  really fast and preforms exactly as expected 
Solid RAM for the price  you definetly get what you pay for
Easy to install  my bios recognized it with no problem 
Not much you can say about ram  I built a new computer and my system posted without any trouble  I went with two of these kits for a total of 32gb ram and its performing exactly as I need and expect it to  Cannot go wrong with PNY 
Good midrange radio  I needed Bluetooth in my car  and this definitely filled the need  Android compatible  I haven t tried apps for the phone yet  since I can control my media player via bluetooth already  Radio works fine  the bluetooth calling works fine  Overall a great Single DIM feature filled radio if you don t need a CD player or GPS  If I had to give it a con  I would say a case for the removable cover would ve been nice  but that s just me being picky  Also read the instrucitions  the  Pause  Play  button is actually labeled as something else for Bluetooth  You may also need to boost the volume for bluetooth specifically  there is a way to do this in the settings  Just spend like 10 15 minutes in your car going through the instructions and playing with the settings 
Instalation was very easy  Very easy to operate  No cd  but no big deal  no one uses cd anyways 
It is a very good radio  The bluetooth hands free phone feature works extremely well  The only gripe I have is that the clock only shows the time when the radio is turned off  I usually know what station I am tuned to  but would like to have the option of a time display all  or at least most  of the time 
This is a good deal and I will buy another one cause I need it
I have tried out a bunch of bluetooth speakers over time  As just a speaker this one is pretty good quality  As far as taking the place of my Alexa it is not up to mustard Get it for a quality portable speaker  and use the Amazon features just as a bonus The speaker was easy to get started out of the box  Mine also came with a wireless charging pad  great feature to add to the purchase   It connected easy with my phone to play music etc  I had issues getting Alexa up and running at first but that may have been a wifi connection issue  You will be required to use the app for the speaker to connect  The connection is good  and sound quality is good  One thing I noticed with this brand of speaker before  and this one  the volume up  down controls are slow to respond and lead to over adjusting the volume before it catches up  This is because it s controlling the phone  device volume it s connected to wirelessly and I guess there s a lag  There are only 4 buttons  volume up  down  power  and sync  All self explanatory  The speaker is a little heavy  so while portable  you probably don t want to carry it around  I suggest taking it where you want and sitting in on a table The charging pad is great  You simply need to replace the screw in hook on the bottom of the speaker with a metal one provided with the base  Then you plug in the base w   provided cord from the speaker  micro USB   Just sit the speaker on top of the prongs on the base and it charges wirelessly and automatically  also it will turn on automatically  so if you don t want it on you ll have to turn it back off  The only other items to check are the Alexa features  I already have one so if you do too  make sure you keep them in separate rooms  Otherwise they will both play the same thing at the same time when you activate them  The main difference I notice with this speaker Alexa ability vs my original one  is this is a speaker first  so it is connecting to a device to play music from there primarily  When I tried to access online amazon stations it would not do so and would pull from my Google Play phone radio stations instead  This may be an issue with my Amazon music account that doesn t allow additional devices without changing plans  So if you want full function and this is not your only Amazon Alexa device you may have to change your account  plan settings to add a speaker  If this is your only Alexa device then it may work as expected Size and shape it is about the same as my Amazon Alexa in size  shape and weight  There is no volume spin control  only up  down buttons Great speaker  okay Alexa  volume adjustments could be a little more responsive 
Buttons could be laid out better  Play  stop  pause  and forward  reverse are all at the top  Rest of the buttons are at the bottom  Need to constantly change hand positions on the remote to control the TV for this reason  Other than that it has worked very reliably  Need to plug it in to charge it about every other day 
We wanted a mid size TV for our sun room and didn�t want to spend a ton  So far we are really pleased  Tip  it defaults to energy saving mode  which is a little dark  Overall quite happy 
These are good quality tapes that we carry all the time when on vacation for our video recorder 
These tapes allow very good quality recordings for a reasonable price 
Very good speakers  I am using them in my Travel Trailer to replace the original roof speakers that came with the trailer  They are performing very well  and have great sound quality  Good deal 
I ve used this commuting on the train    bus and have my laptop messenger bag and a back pack I carry with me  It s so nice to not have to worry about wires when putting all that on and off  The sound quality is really good as well  My only complaint is that after 60 minutes or so it does start to get uncomfortable  not unbearably so  but I do wish it had a softer plastic for the earpiece  It s easy to pair up with a blue tooth device  I use it with my cell phone and tablet 
Little bit of a learning curve   but controls are intuitive once learned  The features make up for the slightly less than audiophile sound  Great overall headphones
Connects easily to any wireless device  High quality sound  Even pairs with a second unit for stereo sound 
Purchased 2 of the Sony XB30 for a house warming and the sound quality and battery was better than expected  Syncing the 2 to my Ipod was simple with no disconnection issues  I also take my XB30 with me to the beach and occasionally on group hike trails 
I purchased this for my home theater and was pleased with the quality  The product appears well made and the sound is crisp  There is obviously bigger systems out there  but for the price  approx   150   you can t beat it 
Present for a loved one who loved the quality sounds  Affordable price 
Good quality product and sound performance  Price is a little high 
These speakers are very impressive  they are a large improvement over stock making them a great value  Very quick and easy installment 
this is a very decent mid range speaker for the price 
It s a much better deal to get the multi pack than to get a single tape at a time  Comes out to be about one third of the cost per tape 
Bought this because I dodnt want to spend over a  100 for some wireless headphones  I have been pleased with the headphones sound an quality 
I bought this for our VW bug  Can use it with your IPOD
This was good for the price  Video quality was very good on my iPhone with the app but the quality when using airplay to my apple TV wasn t as good  Overall for me it did the job while on vacation out of state I was able to get my local sports channels to watch my teams 
Works well and plays pretty loud  Also cool lights that follow the beat of your music 
Excellent sound  water proof  portable  blue tooth  with aux and usb cord  and rechargeable
Good quality film for a great price  Will buy again
I was very impressed with the quality of the product 
Purchased for my husband because he drives trucks  It serves the purpose 
Good Products  When attempting to get a refund for the difference on a sale it was a hassle and did not work out but I am super happy with the device 
Works good  Verizon is ripping me on the data usage though  So I won t have this long 
This remote eliminated 5 remotes on my coffee table  It was easy to set up once you understood how it worked  It works very well as long as you point the remote towards all the equipment  The equipment must all be in the same mode  off  to synchronize the remote 
Have a SONY mini DVI camera which I really like but hadn t used for awhile  I needed blank tapes  as I got into a video project that didn t require HD  I was worried that they would be unavailable  as the technology has moved on  Checked Best Buy on line and they showed them  but said they should be available in stores  as well  I checked my main store  and sure enough  there they were  They did exactly what I needed  but I ran out and went back for more  Of course  they were there  Good product  Good service on the part of Best Buy 
The Slingbox M2 is a good product and I am relatviely happy with my purchase  The only complaint I have about this product is that when I am using my Slingbox  the tv that the box is connected to  in my house  will only play what I am watching on whatever device I am using my Slingbox account on i e  computer  Iphone  etc  So when I am watching the game on the road  my family is watching the game at the house 
Very good product  great sound  very easy to setup 
Wanted a mount that would keep the TV as close to the wall as possible  but previous experience had taught me that accessability to the back of the TV would always be needed  This mount allows a very close to the wall mount  but allows me to pull it out for nice access to the back for wire changes as accessory products come and go 
Call myself an audiophile  but I m really just someone who LOVEs all kinds of music across genres and ages  I ve always enjoyed the peaceful isolation of headphones and evolving stereo  With Bluetooth causing less distortion to sound and improved noise cancelling   ambient technology for wireless headphones  I decided time to upgrade and look at the usual suspects  Sony did have a great  great product at 175 but forgive me as I forgotten the number  m770?   Perfect for young teems and college kids getting into music but may misplace    Given their merger with HK  along with their tremendous royalty and resources     an already established mid range brand at JBL  I felt they couldn t miss  Admittedly  their noice cancelling is truly superb and a leader  Yet  I feel their R D placed such focus on this mastery that they forgot it s the music we care about   Very limited range  distorted highs  and embarrassing lows That said  it s not my nature to bash someone s work  and I d simply suggest this headphone for someone who just needs a well built set for traveling and little less cost  Their well built feel and cuffs are so that your flying companion wont a hear a thing  or simply leave the music off and enjoy that you r not hear those screaming children  Hope JBL figures it out  there s an opportunity between overpriced Beats  which have made vast improvement to sound quality but not reputation  and Magnolia line products like Sessenhieser  Ok  I am impatient and embarraseed    I bought the TOL Beats Pro for 379 for a month until I can sell them and splurge for the Sennsenhiers coming out in Jan with supposed unheard quality    and costs     It s an investment  For the BEATS  I have to admit they have wide hz range  gold drives   3ohms  and clear vocals  Never thought I d say that  I d only recommend themto the right person  They seem durable  too  But  music deserves to be heard in its best form  sorry JBL 
This is my second pair of these headphones  I bought the first ones last year  they must have changed the manufacturing because they didn t sound as great as my first pair do 
I like the head unit and knew what its capabilities were prior to purchasing so I am not as disappointed as some may be if they do not do their research before purchasing  This unit has no CD player  no Bluetooth  and does not work with Android  I have an iPhone and was only interested in FM radio and Apple CarPlay so for me  this is a good purchase 
Overall this is a nice pet  baby monitor with good features  The product comes as a camera that streams video through your Android or iphone  ipad  I plan to use it as a baby monitor and think it will serve the purpose well  with one or two reservations stated at the end of this review First the good 1  Setup was pretty easy and was clearly guided by the included manual  Basically setup involves plugging in and turning on the camera  downloading the Motorola app  in my case from the Apple App Store   creating an account  and synching the device  It all worked pretty smoothly and Motorola deserves credit for that 2  I like the monitor interface  instead of having to keep track of a little camera monitor  you view the picture on your iphone or ipad  which is much more handy  To view the camera  simply click on the app you downloaded and the picture pops up right away  The app is simple and easy to use 3  The camera has some nice features  such as temperature display  and alerts   motion detection  a two way microphone  speaker for communication  photo  video capture  and night vision  all of which seem to work well But I have a few reservations about its features  particularly for the iPhone  iPad 1  For some reason  the software on the Motorola app seems to differ between the Android and the iPhone  The Android apparently lets you capture photos and video both  but the iPhone app only lets you capture photos    no video  That being said  my iPhone app still records video *if the motion detection feature is on*  but this gives me less control over when the video starts and stops Read more

Wish you can download number for channel changing vs icons
installer was professional  informative  and quick
Bought this for my son he loves it  It took a couple drops and is still functioning great  The sound is good  Very light  Good quality product 
Good quality but could be better   Overall I m happy with my purchase   
Great sounding speaker for the price  I definitely would recommend 
This works like a charm  Only one downside is the battery life which is too short 
The way it is designed to access it you have to take the pack off  The zipper and access is on the inside  Seems to be well made just not the right design for me 
The headphones are pretty comfortable  The Bose ones are more comfortable  I am not sure the headphones are worth the     
Good product but a little hard to figure out how to switch between devices
Had problems setting up   but after that the system works good 
Not the easiest setup but provides good viewing angles 
Overall  this is a nice product with good battery life  The only reason I did give it five stars is you have to adjust the equalizer depending on the volume you re listening your music at 
Product works great and easy to get setup  Apps wouldn�t load when it was first setup but after updating the software all was good 
The Ram is a great upgrade for my early 2011 MacBook Pro    but the rated MHz  Is only 1066    it would have been nice to find 1333mhz ram but This does the job just fine  
There are a few things that I would probably like to be different  but overall it is Ok 
This is a good product but it would even be better if there was voice activation on it 
This looks good on my celling  Flushes very well with the celling 
This was a very simple install  product is great  
Very easy to install nice look great sound quality
Wish the form factor was smaller or battery larger
Works grea  t I like it I would recommend a friend to buy it
great product so far  i would recommend this product to anyone
Happy with the weather alert radio  easy to set up and program Appears to be reliable with notifications  This was a replacement for the one we bought 12 years ago   and the price hasn t changed 
I am very satisfied with this product  The sound is great 
IT TAKES TIME TO GET USED TO BUT IS A GOOD PRODUCT
Just was not the right fit for the computer even thought it said it was
My 6 year old son love this product for his music 
Product is great  I just wish spend money on new camera instead 
Product works as advertised  I ll have to wait and see about durability 
Purchased two for my office  Meets all of our expectations 
Quality product with good support would recommend to a friend
The memory works great in my iMac  No problems with installation  Very good instructions 
This is a good headphone for the price you pay  Love it  
Worked right out of package  Easy to install and OS recognized right away 
Works just as described  sounds good  Good quality
For the price its worth the money and if you add a subwoofer the sound is very good would recommend to anyone
bought TV to put on antenna and plan to get a fire stick and see if I like it tired of the cable companies
Looking forward to the versatility this small speaker provides 
It s great for yoga use  My wife users it all the time  The Bluetooth works well and produces good sound 
Works well  charge stays good for a while  good buy
I was excited to find Samsung made a portable battery  IT takes forever to charge  I leave it hooked up overnight  It does get my phone up to 85% when it is about to die  I don t like that the instructions say overtime it will stop working  There is no set date  For the price paid  I would expect it to last for a while  So far so good
Pros  The picture is great  and its system menus are easy to navigate Cons  The TV speakers are absolute garbage  I ve owned several TVs ranging from very expensive to very cheap  some of them Samsungs  but this particular TV has the worst speakers I ve ever had the displeasure of hearing  No matter what settings I use  there is a ton of feedback  even on voices  Typically  you ll get feedback on some really low or high frequencies when not using an external sound system  but this TV gives feedback while listening to ordinary dialogue on Seinfeld with the volume only at 20   
Got the m2 and happy with picture  not HD quality but ok for what I wanted it for 
works well sounds good  was easy to figure out how to use iam satisfied with it
Good Performance Ram  No issues  Would purchase again 
Great features  It does control my components well  Does take some time and knowledge to set up using computer and Logitech web site 
Need a single solution to handle my entertainment center in my office  Longer to program than I thought it would take but overall once I learned the controls and programmed it the system became very easy to use 
Camera picture quality is okay for the price  Being able to access it by phone or computer to see what s going on  is nice  Sometimes the server will kick me out  and I have to reconnect  but overall is pretty nice for the price 
When I first went looking for a small desktop Bluetooth speaker system I came across this one  people gave it great reviews for being so small so I made with the purchase when I received it I inspected the whole thing  I found a minor problem one of the buttons was smashed into the unit for the power button  station button for radio but everything else worked and I was impressed with the sound for the bones I shelled out customer service rep may seem a little edgy but they did what I asked and shipped me a new one and I love it  It s funny the price was crossed out and a significantly lower price was advertised   it s worth the lower price value just not what they had crossed out at the top 
Used for outdoor listening  Has plenty of power with good clarity
First of all let me say I never write reviews   good or bad  This product is so poorly thought out and overpriced that I was compelled to write this  Let me start by saying that I have used harmony remotes in the past and was completely satisfied with them  I thought my old Harmony One was a fantastic unit until I stepped on it and cracked the glass  That was that  Then I bought this new Harmony One expecting another great product  Aside from the fact that it was a new model of the Harmony One  I was drawn in by the new touch screen  smaller size and new design  The old one used hard buttons  Big mistake  I allowed myself to be sucked in  So  what s wrong with it First  the touch screen is way too sensitive  It seems to be activated simply by having a finger near the screen without  not by touching it  Secondly  the actual physical buttons are placed above the touch screen  making it very easy to change the channel or the function accidentally  Third  it s infrared beam  I don t even use the IR  is very focused and frequently does not control all components for a particular function  say watch TV  in sync  I could go on and on  but I think you get the idea  This thing costs between 300 and 400 dollars to boot  Well  the story has a happy ending  I recently found the old model Harmony One on Amazon for a pretty penny  but I have a lot of components in my system and this remote controls them all perfectly  One final word  Do Not Buy This Product  It is junk  You would be better off giving your hard earned money to charity  There  I finally got it off my chest  Live and be well 
Bought new unit after my original sling box died  First one I bought had an issue completing the setup  not uncommon looking on the web   The second box had no issues and works fine 
Has been working just as well as the more expensive models  Does not use HDMI  but uses component  The WiFi is working perfectly 
This product is only good to use if the main TV is never used  It will change the channel on the main TV  There is nothing too great about this  Off to college and you want to keep your room cable then maybe this fits you  Honestly you are off to college you should save your parents a few bucks and let them cancel your service 
Lack of ssd is negitive  All other components are good 
Works for my house size      Simple and sweet in Bose home theater packages 
I bought the Nighthawk WiFi Adapter in order to back my office computers direct cable connection  which sometimes has connection issues  This WiFi adapter works pretty well considering that the modem is located downstairs and in another part of the house  My direct  hard wired  connection usually yields around 300 350 mps  while the Nighthawk WiFi adapter is yielding around 200 mps  which is not that bad  This particular adapter should work well for all of the computers in my house because I have a relatively fast internet connection speed to start with  However  for those who are connecting at around 50 mps  I think you d need to be relatively close to the modem for it to work properly 
Does good job combining 4 different remotes just for home theater 
Found this mouse comfortable although it was a bit large for my medium sized hands  rubber sides may wear down eventually  but still a good bargain compared to other mice from different companies 
Seems to be a good mount so far  it is a little too expensive for the quality of build that it is  Does the job though
A good overall TV mount for large screen TV s with average expertise  handyman skills 
Good mount for a 40 inch flat Samsung Smart TV  Easy to install the mount on the wall and easy to  hang  the TV from the mount  No particular problems were discerned during the installation 
Mount itself is great quality but did not work for us  the backing did not allow for us to use with our tv due to the plug outlet location  Unfortunately  my new took a couple weeks to arrive and by then I could not return  exchange this mount either 
Very good battery for powering your electronics on the go  It does take a few hours to charge  and I do recommend that you use all of the charge before recharging  but it is great to have for additional power
TV is perfect for a midsize apartment when the watcher prefers to use it to stream online TV shows  movies  etc  Easy connectivity and very light 
This is a great buy  The sound is excellent for the money spent 
I have an older iMac and need to updgrade the memory  Luckily my loca Best Buy had this and it works great 
Be sure that your computer has available memory expansion slots 
This is certainly not the fastest memory out there  but after having a different brand of memory not boot my system  this did the trick and just worked  I think I m going to have to buy a second set to boost up my gaming rig even more  Fairly priced too 
memory works well  does run a little hotter than some other options
Best buy was having a sale  like when they have this kind of sale  good price
Used to increase my PCs ram to 32  and I couldn t be happier 
works as advertised
This proved to be too difficult for me to set up My friend  a high tech person  also could not figure it out I wanted something easy to use for my sister  who has dementia I think I have dementia after trying to set it up    
This was an easy hook up with the iPhone and stays linked without issues and has a decent sound for the value paid 
looks good but has some issues over price will not work with Bluetooth device s also they made it way to complicated to program device s
It s pretty good  This is probably the 5th Logitech universal remote I ve owned  I ve had 600 series  640   720  Harmony One  and two Harmony Ultimate Ones  Logitech has a long tradition of crappy hardware  Many of my remotes have developed intermittent contact with their charging stations  making annoying beeps and not recharging  this one finally is better  The remote sits securely in the cradle  The ergonomincs are just mediocre  Hard to hit the right buttons with one hand  And I don t yet get all the screen shortcuts  But as always Logitech s device database is extraordinary  That s the real value 
The speaker quality is not great  but it is useful when showering shaving and other utility purposes 
Pros Nice speaker for the price Looks good and gets pretty loud  Cons Beeps every time you adjust the volume Had trouble getting a device synced to it  another device hooked up right away  Not sure what the trouble was 
Great product  just doesn t seem to work every time    Sometimes  not often  it doesn t prompt me to swipe my finger  almost like I don t have a fingerprint reader 
I m glad I purchased the keyboard cover  It attaches easily to computer  Have been using 6 months   have had one incident where it became disassociated from computer  Had to look up problem   do double reboot which reassociated it  Glad to have it but wish numbers were not just along top of keyboard 
Good Keyboard and addition to the Surface Pro platform if you desire fingerprint scanner access  For my use the Surface Pro Keyboard without fingerprint scanner works just fine 
I wish it worked seperate from tablet by the way of Bluetooth connection 
I ve only had this a few weeks  but     Feels solid  good tactile feel for my typing needs  good key layout  Backlight works great  although it doesn t turn off automatically when not needed  i e  in a well lit room   Fingerprint sensor seems to work as advertised  Touchpad works nicely  Somewhat pricey  but it works great  Wish it came in colors other than black 
Works very well  Only thing I don t like is the keyboard has some give to it  Not the keys  but the actual beybpard  When you type is pushes down  so the keyboard doesn t stay flat  Guess its an issue because of how thin it is 
I don t use the fingerprint  but now have the option  I like the lighted keys and the responsiveness of the keys 
Good item but if it is not discount  I will not buy it 
Need a pocket sized external battery for your cell? This is one 
This item is very good and The brand is reliable and easy to use 
i think alpine puts out a good product i have no complaints
Works with a lot of different equipment  but acts crazy alot of the time  If you turn on the tv with the oem remote  the Harmony won t turn it off when you hit the off button  still have to keep all of my old remotes close by because the harmony does t have all the functions on it  Also the battery runs down fast  If it wasn t free with my projector purchase   I would have taken it back 
Good idea  very poor performance  It appears to be programmed correctly but cannot select the correct input to the TV  The sync function  which syncs the remote to the settings saved online freezes up  It is much easier to use the individual remotes than to try to get this to work  I would not recommend to anyone 
The remote is a great idea and Logitech has definitely taken time to make setup as simple as possible  but the touch screen interface isn t very responsive and the programming is a lot of trial and error with manual configuration still needed  Once it works though  it s great 
It s a good PC I would recommend this to a Friend 
Good hotspot  Verizon definitely has the best wifi
No problems yet  With Sprint I had 20 connection problem s a day  So far so good 
Great alternative to 4G integrated device  Easy to set up 
Good quality wireless headphones  Better than those overpriced beats 
Good headset for the price  plus no wires  its just good
Good quality headset for the price  plus no wires  
Overall good headphones  Noise canceling could be better
Bought this for my 11 yr old because she broke 3 pairs of ones that had the wires within 2 months  They on do the job well  They stay charged forever  She didn t like the fit on the ear when she 1st put them on but with the sound on she says she doesn t feel them  They do slip down her head often which is the only downfall I would day 
I really love using the bluetooth feature of the headphones  It s awesome to be able to listen to music at the office without disrupting anyone  and can still get up and walk around without having to take them on and off constantly  They are also nice for exercising because I have trouble keeping earbuds in my ears  so the over the head style is great for me  Also  the sound quality is quite good for the price  I haven t tested out a phone call on them yet  but hope to do that soon 
Good headphones  except they re just a hair to small for my big head  At first i thought it could be doable but after a couple hours i could feel them pressing on the top of my head and earlobes  didn t feel like i had a good seal  Had to return them for Bose instead Too bad  i really like the sound 
These were certainly good headphones and the noise cancelling was awesome  Only problem with Bluetooth Noise Canceling headphones is that they can be a bit large  clunky  I ended up returning these and went with the slightly more expensive Samsung Level Over headphones  Excellent quality and they were a bit smaller 
I really liked these headphones  they are a step above beats in sound quality and noise cancelation  The app that goes with it is awesome and really takes these headphones to the next level  I think for the price they could have put them a hard protective case instead of the fabric one  However after wearing these a few times they were to big on my head so I traded then in for bose 
My daughter bought these for herself  She listens to audio books and music  She likes the noise cancelling and the good sound  She s not one to listen at loud levels  so I can t address how good it is at loud levels but it is great at normal levels  She s sensitive to touch  so she had to have something super comfortable and these are perfect  They go completely around the ear 
This is my third pair of BT headphone  headset that I ve owned  Cardo S2  LG Tone   All 3 pairs of headphone are different type of wear so it is hard to compare how comfortable it is  That said this headphone  headset is remarkably light  I understand why some people commented that their ear get sweaty as my ear definitely felt hotter with the headphone on  Still I have this headphone on during my 90 minutes commute and it was comfortable enough In terms of audio quality  not being an audiophile  I am happy with the sound  I can hear the lyrics   melody clearly and the sound is comparable to the other BT headphones that I ve owned  The call quality was clear and both myself and the caller have no problem hearing each other  The only complaint that I have is that occasionally while on BT  I would get a hiccup during a song where it would pause for a second  I suppose that is an inherent problem with BT and signal interference but I did not have that problem with my other BT headphones The biggest selling point for me is the fact that I can connect the included 3 5mm cable to make the headset a wired headphone  It has always been a gripe to me that you would spend some money on a BT headphone that will become useless once the rechargeable battery is dead  Now that is no longer an issue  The only thing is that the included cable will not allow you to use the mic on the headphone to make calls  However   MEElectronics sells a replacement 3 5mm cable that includes an in line remote with microphone in case you want to use this headphone as a wired headset also 
Good head unit for the money  Typical Sony  PITA to work the controls  but once you do it a few times it gets easier  Be aware  only has front and sub RCA outs  no rear outs WTF Had to use a line out converter to make rear RCA outs to connect to an amp  Sounds good though 
Definitely would purchase again  Great for gaming 
I purchased this as an upgrade to the Harmony One that I had  Over time the Harmony Ones keys were starting to stick  common fate when you have kids even older ones like mine   This was a great upgrade  This remote charges vertically which reduces the amount of space it needs on my couch side table  Plus we can add all our favorite channels and the remote shows the channel logos right on the screen Setting it up was a breeze  Supply the model numbers of the devices and it all works as I wanted the very first time 
Good bag if you don t plan on carrying alot  Storage for a couple lenses and the camera  Maybe a flash 
Really nice and functions as it s advertised but programming can take a considerable amount of time and getting use to
Good for us to see Movies at Home with my Family in my day off and i can see Movies anywhere if i am not at Home
My unix computer is on 24x7 for years at a time  so I wanted a non windows drive that would last for at least 3 years  My previous drive was an enterprise class drive for unix and it was born in 2007  so about 10 years  This drive is a not very much more expensive   20?  but advertised to have the stamina  I purchased a pair of them for a btrfs mirror a couple of months ago and they are still running  They are quieter than my previous drives  too  At this point  i would recommend them 
Good for the price  but slips off of your head if you bend over 
Good sound and quality just wish it was louder but good overall
The sound could be louder but overall good product 
2 TB for the price of  84 99 It was a great deal during this time but price might have went up  2 TB is decent amount of space  If you do a lot of video editing and Fraps recording  I would suggest you get a bigger space  I d say a 4TB 
It was my first Bluetooth headphone   So I can t compare with other Bluetooth headphones but when compared to my other headphones   100 to  200   it is as good as my others  Relatively good sound quality  good size  long battery life  easy connection  My only not so great is   it takes some time to charge using usb devices  I would like to recommend to friends who are looking for a BT headphone 
It�s spacious and practical for the price  It�s cheaper than other places 
The sound is pretty good and it fits just about anywhere 
I needed to replace my stock speakers  So went ands got these and installed them in no time
Pretty good player for the money  Does what I need it to do 
Great replacement for VW Jetta rear door speakers 
I would recommend for quick charge  Very light weight and nice to put in brief case
I wish the ear pieces were a bit bigger in the indent but overall these work great  12 hour plane to Romania and they blocked out what I needed not to hear 
good quality for price  good looking not space age
it works beautifully with my cellphone  but when i connect to my Asus ROG  it cuts in and out with videos and when i talk on skype my friends tell me that it sounds fine  could just be my laptop  but i think this is a great product 
It s good for my camera  it s great for memory to watch the kids to grow up and see their self as kids
Good miniDV Tapes  not much else to say about them 
Works well pleased with the memory and price  Now I have 32 Gigs for my computer  Sweet       
I got this strictly for Apple CarPlay and I love being able to use it with my iPhone 
I love this iten the sound quality and the lights makes any get together awsome
Great bracket  I first felt it was somewhat pricey  but after it was installed and the 65  TV mounted  it was very secure  hence well worth the money 
I am using the headphones as a monitor for work I am doing in GarageBand  I am editing my bands practice digital recordings and was looking for phones that would not color the sound  These are very good 
I like the feel of this keyboard above many that I ve used  and I love the magnetic connector  Also offers great protection for the display 
We have used various wireless adapters on our computers upstairs  they do not have built in wireless capability  but they don t work very good  They lose connection and are slow  We have a Nighthawk modem  router downstairs so I decided to try the adapter  Wow what a difference it has made  Connection is good and pages now load fast  Very happy with the Nighthawk adapter  A word of warning though   it states it has a very strong magnetic base so I would not recommend placing it to close to the computer  Ours is on a bookshelf next to the computer  Also it was a lot larger than I expected 
Excellent expansion to expand my pcs memory from 16 GB to 32 GB  I probably didn t need it  but I really do love it 
We re using this box to forward television from across the Pacific ocean to our house in Minnesota  It works fine  but with some caveats The specific country we re forwarding from isn t in the pre defined list of countries the Slingbox supports  so we had to do some googling to find a compatible on screen  remote  for the cable box there  The other downside is that we can t reliably get the best quality video that the box supports  That s not a problem with the Slingbox  just an issue with the internet  Both the sending location and our house have internet packages that should easily support the highest quality  So keep in mind that the connection isn t entirely in your power to fix 
Very easy setup  setting options to customize for your location  reduce alerts from outside your area  Compact size
Really do a good job with active noise cancellation and sound is good  A little bulky on my head though  but wireless is only way to go 
So far to date I haven t had any problems with these drives right out of the box  They ve outlasted my hardware I installed them in and enjoyed the performance 
Drive works well but it is NOT designed to be a desktop hard drive this drive is designed for NAS boxes  It will work in a desktop drive but windows may report errors due to the way the HDD is designed 
Good doesnt breaks easily
good but not great feel like at times the buttons don t always work
The technology is clearly advanced  all my devices are controlled by the Logitech Harmony Ultimate One  Had a brief delay with setup which did not like my small Atom processor  Setup was unique and fast  thought I would have a problem with my Bose Cinemate  where I could not locate a model number but the Logitech had no problems locating  I would recommend this product 
This device works pretty good  I have it located at the other end of our home from the router and have no real problems  It didn t get 5 stars because it s a Netgear product and is replacing a Netgear extender that crapped out after less than 2 years  Their brand is not quality 
I am confident that this is a great device  yet it did not service and real estate of 5 people  It may work better for individual usage 
Been very pleased with my purchase  No issues with setup or operation 
GOOD MATERIAL AND WELL MADE CAMERA BAG  I USE IT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I SHOOT OUTDOOR  THIS BAG DELIVERS  ERGONOMICAL AND FASHIONABLE 
Really enjoy this new deck  it kinda sucks that there is no keyboard feature for text messages  but other than that love all the features  Hopefully with time more apps jump on the apple CarPlay band wagon so they can be used through the deck interface 
Purchased these for a flight over seas  and they worked great 
The RAM chips we competitively priced and are performing well 
Great value   very good quality   good sound  functionality  easy to setup and use 
I like em good sound and good price  Local shop installed all four speakers for 100 bucks  I like em 
Very affordable memory upgrade  Used this to upgrade my 2011 MacBook pro 13  from 4GB to 8GB  Big difference  boots quicker  runs snappier with much less lag  Next will be an SSD drive  Was very easy to install  online tutorials or instructions posted on Apple support 
in this office I use only dell products and am very satisfied with their perfomance
Works with Ryzen and Intel processors  at the 2400mhz rating 
Set up was easy  Got this remote to replace an older Harmony remote  Liked the push keys better than having to watch the screen to change channels or page up   down in guide mode  Overall a good product 
Packaging and store employees did not know that a Firestick or Roku was needed to use this  Did not work well at all on a wireless network  Needs to be wired directly to cable  Store employees understood concept but had no idea what was required for implementation 
So far I haven t had any problems with this computer and it plays all of my games just fine
I would recommend to family and friend its a good computer
Have have had great luck so far with my computer  It has done everything it was supposed to do  It is fast and so far very dependable 
Probably could have gotten better speakers for same dollars  only got the Alpine 6 5 because installer suggested them  and i didn t have time to research other like Kenwood or Sony 
These are nice and clear fit in nicely easy to install
Prefer a bit more base   Sound clarity is great and the battery last a long time  
Nice size for packing  and good capacity  Good buy for the money 
The charger is really good  It appears to power up my electronics faster than my normal outlets  The only downside is that it was bigger than I thought it was 
Glad best buy had the tapes Not sure who else does 
We always buy these tapes for our sony camcorder and they work well
Good buy for the money and it�s worth the price for this item
I bought this keyboard because my Surface Pro 3 needed a pick me up  I also bought this keyboard expecting that it would not be more special than the other keyboards  My expectations were met and I love this keyboard  Things that I like    This keyboard is more quiet than my Surface Pro 3 keyboard   The keys are spacious   The trackpad is larger   The look Things that I did not like    It costs a little more than the others  though it is the same    Just like the other Surface Pro 4 Keyboards it does not have the specialized Surface shortcut keys in the top row  It is just a standard keyboard 
I like it very powerful radio great sound really good for price
I used this tv for my menu Board  Works well does the job
Great value and easy setup  Picture is sharp  Easy to access the Internet 
I believe my nephew would really enjoy this product 
The charger worked really well and was exactly same as the original one that got lost 
The radio does as it describes but make sure u not looking for a CD player cause it could be confusing by the display 
These tapes work very well and the price is great when purchased in the multi packs 
Great remote for everything except I wish there was a set of page up  page down hard buttons on the remote instead of in the touch screen 
Works great on  pre set  stations  Not so great  when you have to type in the selected stations  You have to hold and point the device directly at the modem  or it will not function unlike my older Harmony Remote  which I simply wore out because of use 
So i am typing this on mine but there are some problems like a loud spacebar and the wider keys like backspace caps shift enter and space feel a bit spongy and also from gaming the w key is showing some yellowy stuff that probably is the black paint wearing of and another thing is if bumped from the side with medium strength it will disconnect and reconnect for a second and some driver issues too it a usb mouse is connected the cursor will get jumpy if the trackpad is used even if the mouse isn t touched
It is taking me a while to adjust to this remote  but the more I use it the more I like it  Although it is definitely not perfect  The set up was easy but I still find that it is easier to grab my old cable box remote at times when using my DVR 
I got these because I was going on an 8 hour flight and could not find my Bose headphones  These worked for the trip   but I don t think they are as good as the Bose headphones 
Really like the fact that i can control all the devices in my entertainment area  but with one caveat  The controller has issues with my sound bar and occasionally cannot either power it on or off  A friend of mine purchased one with me and is reporting similar issues with their sound bar 
The first thing I noticed when I put it on is that it s tighter on my head than the one that I tried on in the store  Hopefully it gets looser as I wear it  Otherwise I ll end up with migraines every time I use it 
Start with the fact that I have 4 logitech 900 rf remotes plus this one  I definately prefer the old style with more actual buttons plus the real number pad  This unit works as it is supposed to but I need to keep switching LCD screens to do thing that are right there on the 900  The hard number key pad in my opinion is so important that it looses two start without it 
This is my 3rd Harmony remote  I bought it because my last Harmony One had a broken display after using it for 4 years  Therefore my review is based on the comparison of the last 2 remotes I used First thing I noticed is that this remote is lighter than the other ones  Also  in order to upload the configuration I needed to download the new MyHarmony software  instead the older software  The good thing is that I was able to migrate all the configuration from my Harmony One  However  after the migration  not all configuration was perfectly in place  for example  some of the buttons were not working  or not there anymore  so I needed to manually configure them again  not perfect  This remote is based on its touchscreen display  I am trying to get used to it  since my Harmony One had more  analog  buttons  This one of the disavantages  I think   I was used to feel the buttons and never look at them when I needed to press anything  With this remote I need to look at the display every time I need to change channels  However you can include your favorite channels as your main screen  which makes sense since I noticed I usually watch a half dozen channels If you are a newbie with a Harmony remote you may find some difficulties with programming  but since I have already owned a previous model  I think it is a very good remote  but a little worse than older models 
Got a 65 on it  Installation was a breeze  Only complaint is the TV of this size means your studs better be situated so the TV is centered on the mount  There s not enough strength in the bars to allow you to move it right or left without the TV getting off center as it tilts right or left  I was able to make mine work but will be upgrading to a heavier and more expensive version for my den  In hindsight  I should have paid a little more for a heavier duty version  Not a product issue  but me trying to shave a few bucks 
Used to be a Seagate fan for their 5 yrs warranty on Hard rives but Seagate reduced warranty to 1 years on their hard drives  Started using Toshiba Hard drives since last 2 years and did not turn back  So far no problem with any of Toshiba Hard drives I have  The Price is lower if not lowest than other brands  This is my 1st 3TB drive came in retail pack which is very important for me  For an anticipated preexisting drop injury to a hard drive  retail packaging lowers the risk of failing  I do not like green drives which turn off or spin down and when accessed they take time to comeback to speed  I use this large capacity drive for Movies and it is almost instantaneous when accessing data from this drive  I am very happy with Toshiba hard drives 
Bought this to wall mount a 55 inch flat screen television Did the job  Easy to mount Felt secure Haven t experienced any issues 
Bought this for my son s baseball games so the kids can make a playlist for themselves  Love it but I have a hard time when someone tries to link their playlist to the speaker  Need to figure it out but great product  
My daughter loves it s size and clarity great for her room
I bought this for my daughter and she likes it a lot  No complaints 
Good balance of sound and I like the ability to shut off the noise canceling function if it s not needed  I would recommend these to anyone 
Battery Pack is good   can only charge the phone once on a full charged pack and it charges slow  But overall its good  got me outta a dead battery no outlet situation plenty of times already  Just make sure you always charge the pack after using it 
This was a gift for my husband  I did a lot of research before pulling the trigger on this model  It does the job wonderfully  It s easy to program from the computer   plugin the cable  download the software  and start programming with just few inputs and clicks  We programmed our TV  DVD player  Rocky  cable box  and receiver in about fifteen minutes 
Is a good ten good sound and small size I can take everywhere
Sounds great in the jeep with top off  good sound but not much bass
Needed to connect to a computer and iPhone to listen to training videos  Works great 
Just what I was looking for  something easy to use and not too many options to have to worry about  Good for a smaller size room  and definitely was loud enough for my uses  Easy to set up 
The Flipside 300 is an excellent bag for a day trip where you will not carry a lot of gear  Though you can fit a good bit of stuff in it though  I packed my Nikon D7100 with an 80 400mm lens attached  an 18 70mm lens and a 50mm lens into this bag  Along with my spare batteries  my flash and a couple extra items  I picked the f for it s slim design and good protection for my gear  It didn t disappoint me  Two flights and a hectic bus ride later  it is holding up perfectly fine  The only drawback is that I can t fit one more camera body inside without a problem due to my camera sizes  Otherwise  it s a great  bag  Lightweight  comfortable and protective  an excellent combination 
Pros It has very good padding on all the sides  enough space for 1 camera and 3 4 lenses and speedlite flash and a pouch for accessories  I m happy with its features  Cons 1  It doens t have space for laptop2  Straps are extendable so they are long  wish it had holders where the extra strap line can be secured 
This bag offers good protection and room for other stuff 
The Belkin charger is a great go to when in need of an alternative charging source  Inexpensive but well worth it 
When you don t want to spend too much on higher end  high availibility drives  nor too little on desktop drives  this is a great alternative Works as expected  Too early to tell reliability on my recent batch  My older batch has been working fine since day 1 
This is a solid weather alert radio and was easy to set up 
bought this for use on campus  dorm  and around campus More bass than similarly priced units  Good amount of battery life  Only downside is that this speaker is slippery to hold  so you have to be careful walking around with it 
Good alternative to Multiple Cable boxes  Eliminates the need for multiple cable boxes 
Much better than my old Logitech remote  This one is easy to program and works much better 
I had the previous Logitech All in One Remote for the past 7 years  When the screen began acting up  I realized how dependent I was with this remote  So we replacement it with this one and has some better features than the old one 
I received this product as part of the Best Buy Tech Insider program for my honest review  The sony xb30 bluetooth speaker is a good bluetooth accessory but not perfect  To my ears  the sound seems a little muffled  The highs and mid range sounds don t seem as sharp and crisp as I had hoped  I m not saying that the sound is bad  because it isn t  but maybe I expected a little more  sound volume is good for indoor use or outdoors if you are going to be near the speaker  It is not a speaker you could use to provide music for a large group or a pool party or something similar  If you are hanging out by the pool or at the beach  this speaker has plenty of volume  howerver  One thing I would change on the speaker is the charging system  The speaker has a proprietary charger  I would have much rather they sent a usb charger of some type to charge of of a computer or where you could use an existing cell phone charger when you need to add a little power  the speaker will last a long time on a single charge  however  so you shouldn t be charging all that often unless you are a power user  The speaker is good for what I will use it for   sitting around a campsite or watching my little girls dance to music off my phone in the backyard  Its a good speaker with some potential 
This remote set up easily  However  I was missing certain menu items and it is not straightforward on how to add them 
It is slower maneuvering around but has lots of bells n whistles 
Have a I  mac desktop p c  Only had 4 m  Of ram was able to increase to 16   For a little over  125  Worth the money for the up grade 
I replaced a model I lost that was 2 years old  The new one looses connection will using it moving in a vehicle  never had that problem with old unit
Works well   Keeos Phone Charged 100% while using your phone
Good so far  although it gave a warning that the wattage may be different
Good speaker product I really enjoy them  Crispy sound out of the kicker I would recommend them
Got this tv about a week I�m pretty happy with it   It�s a good tv for the price
I got both the reg 700 and the Elite 700s during a flash sale so I got a really good price  I got the Elites for 200  If you can find them for that then I think they are really good  I wouldn t pay 300 for them though To me these fit differently than the reg 700s  The cups don t come down as far as the reg 700 s  The openings seem smaller as well  Just go to Best Buy and try both of them for yourself I have done a critical listening comparison with the reg 700 vs the Elite 700s  But just casually listening between the two I really can t tell the difference between the two  The active noise cancellation def makes the headphones plays softer  Turn it off with the app and it plays louder  The app really sucks by the way These are bulkier looking on your head than the Beats if you care about that  Can t say they are better than Beats or Bose  Sound quality is very subjective  Just try them all and see which one sounds better to you with music you like to listen to I just bought these because they were 100 dollars off  I certainly didn t need to buy two headphones but oh well 
I was looking for a decent Bluetooth speaker and this did the job
It isn t the best speaker I ve heard  but for the price  I didn t expect it to be  It is just what I wanted  a reasonably priced  decent sounding speaker  As such it is more than adequate 
Ok just hard to use   Too many different buttons to use
The remote was easy to set up and program  Once I started using  the commands seem to be slow  I use it to control my TV  Apple TV and soundbar  There s a minor delay once you select the command  Also the battery doesn t seem to last as long as i though but not terrible  Overall it gets the job done and is a pretty good product with minor issues  complaints 
This speaker is pretty good the only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is because the base even when it s not on extra base mode can sometimes be to much  Other then that it s pretty good 
Works good  but I wish it would have had a setting to shut if off after so long with no activity as to not kill the battery 
Best buy had a great hotspot deal that gave you a discount on the samsung tablet and well they had great plans as well 
Excellent peoce of exciptment i love this thing i use it all over the place
Good quality  excellent sound and also better price
Good set of headphones  Noise cancelling isn t that good  but the sound quality is good especially when connected with wire 
Good so far                                        
Good tv for the price shopping at best buy the best
I am really enjoying this product  It work really well and it plays very well  Good purchase 
Im vey satisfied for what I paid good sound good bass
Received this very quick  Worked exactly as advertised
This product is good  Would recommend to others looking
Very good product Good integration with iphone and good sound
Was the cheapest one I could fine  It was for a old Mac pc
We use the feed dodger games from a house that has time warner  Does the job
gold connections wear out within 6 mos they should make a plug in that handles 8 components or DON T BUY LOGITECH  This is the 7th logitech I have purchased over the 10 15 year period and the first one I had to find a different  As soon as they get someone to place the buttons where they belong ie  harmony one and get their recharging system to last long then 6 months I m going back to them 
I actually wore out the last Harmony Remote after 15 years of daily use  Logitech has come up with another winner   their support staff walked me through the set up and within minutes the data was transferred from the old Harmony to the new one  You can t go wrong with this   
Why settle for less than the best quality ? Catch them on sale for about 95  
Goood is nice                                      
This is more than A BLUETOOTH SPEAKER  The songpal app  the wireless multi room option is awesome    Better than competitors      Powerful and upscaled sound stage     Glorious speaker
Ewwww  just way way too glitchy  Let me give you an example  Say you ve got the TV on watching a DVD  That would require the TV be on  The DVD player be on  and the AV receiver to be on  Now I want the remote to tell the AV receiver to change it to a radio station  Well it does that but it leaves the TV and DVD player on  Then you have to go through all of these gyrations on it s help menu to get these other items turned off  but does it remember to do that the next time you do the same thing       no  Sometimes the remote would do the right thing and sometimes it wouldn t  It seemed to me like I was always trying to get it to hit all of the right functions that it should have on its own known to do  I tried another Logitech remote  same problem  Buy the URC RF20  spend 30 minutes programming it  and then use it for the next five years until it will finally wear out 
not very user friendly  Gets  hung up  frequently when trying to turn on or change channels so you have to reset the TV and audio  User manual is only available online 
keep up the good work  associates VERY helpful  stores are doing good job in keeping up with today s products
works as expected  Allowed us to watch tv at the lake house
There are several types and models to pick from  The Best Buy employee really knew about the different types and asked questions to find the best fit for me and to meet my needs  I had a lesser model last time and my wife found it difficult to operate  This one she find much better and therefore its a winner  Easy to program  Just have to be careful on holding it in the position to will allow all components to be activated 
I bought this unit to control my TV  DVR when I m not at home  I can watch my DVR recordings and watch any of my subscribed TV stations from anywhere 
Purchased this item after conducting a Google search for the  Best Headphones Wireless   After reading several reviews  I decided to purchase and I am quite pleased with the decision 
I just received this remote yesterday and I just finished setting up my new remote  I had the Harmony One which I loved and now this remote just adds to to the Harmony line up  Set up was easy and pain free I guess if you are familiar with setting up Harmony remotes  it will be easy to do  If you aren t familiar with Harmonytake your time the site walks you through the entire process and you will be done in no time  I like the way the remote is set up and I don t have an issue  as others have stated they do  I would buy another one of these remotes in a heart beat I always recommend Harmony remotes to the people that see my set up the poeple I know don t see the value in a good universal remote and they just can t justify the price  If you are a home theater buff and a true movie watcher  you will love the things this remote can do  I will rotate my remotes  Harmony Onemaster bedroom set up 890 oldest son s room  880youngest son s room and the 650basement  this will reduce the need for spending money on batteries for all the other remotes in my house  Give the Ultimate one a try see for your self  then you can decide for yourself if the remote is worth your time and money 
Bought this as a gift for my son for Father s Day from his daughter  Was the perfect gift  Was exactly what he wanted  I didn t know anything about the item  but the store associate was very helpful in making the choice 
I bought this for our ski trip to Tahoe  Device works  but can be spotty  Also  you can t change the password so it can be a hassle to always navigate through to the wifi password menu 
So far it s been going good with the jetpack and I ve seen a slight uptick in speeds  Although it s up to the provider to keep it running smoothly  Other than that it works great 
I use device for streaming NFL games and other programs that are blacked out from my cable providers mobile  internet platforms 
If you are sold on a surface you must have the keyboard 
WOW  What a great remote I bought a new Samsung Soundbar that for whatever reason Samsung didn t design it to turn on AND off with the TV  It was one or the other depending on how you connected it  Optical or HDMI   I spoke with a co worker who raved about this remote and thought that it might work  I gave it a try and to my amazement  it worked Not only that  but it also easily controls all of my devices Would highly recommend 
Some people can t wire a long Ethernet cord around the house and this is a good replacement  Just make sure your router and your internet speed works with it 
My newly acquired XPS had to be repaired within one month of my purchase  Suddenly the Blue Sign appeared and my internet and sound were gone  Geek Squad couldn t tell me exactly what had happened  I just cross my fingers for this  1 200 s investment 
Horrible product  Never got it to work  Absolute garbage  No customer service support
Besides the video card this thing is great  which it s not horrible just not the 1060  I d prefer  The sail price was hard to beat plus the open box discount  I couldn t even build this for that price  Thanks
An awesome buy  got this item with a best buy price match  best purchase I made in a long time  compact enough to carry in pocket and enough of a boost to get you buy  Quality product 
I love this battery charger  I have 2 other chargers and they are just fine but they do not beat this one  This one charges my Galaxy Note 3 fast  It is thin and easy to stash in a pocket or wallet  I can also use the phone while it s attached without having a charger hanging from the bottom of phone  This one I just put on back of phone while I talk and it is just the same as holding the phone to talk  No one is even aware it s there  So It is the best I have found Pros are its flat and lays behind phone while I talk  Charges my large  phablet  phone fast and completely  It is thin and light enough to go in my pocket  wallet or purse without any bulk  I would not only recommend but I d buy one for a gift 
This type cover gets quite dirty and is tricky to clean  Otherwise  it functions as expected and doesn t look horrible  although I m disappointed that it no longer has the crisp  clean grey color I was attracted to in the first place 
This model has one major flaw  the layout of the buttons is very bad  Transport buttons are above the LCD screen and function buttons below  which makes it pretty clumsy to use  The new model coming out fixes that  What were they thinking
I purchased this Hit Spot device as my new house is out in the country  It has limited range one only works on computer 
This remote replaced my venerable Harmony One  which I loved dearly  The Ultimate One s dock does not have a light  which I miss when returning the remote for charging in the dark  The remote has a lot of annoying features  The most noticeable is the lock screen  but that can be disabled  The location of the play  fast forward  and rewind buttons do not fall within the natural arc of your thumb like they did with the Harmony One  The Volume and Channel buttons are only illuminated in the middle  not on the ends where the up and down buttons are actually located   this makes it more difficult to press them in the dark  With the previous remote  my projector would never turn off automatically  even though I programmed separate  off  and  on  codes  I simply copied the programming from the old remote to the new using the web site  and in less than 10 minutes  the new remote was operational  and the projector problem was gone  I have love hate relationship with this remote  Logitech should move the play  forward  back  stop buttons back below the screen where they re more readily accessed by one s thumbs  and illuminate both the up and down buttons  and you d have a winner  I ve gotten used to the remote  but given its frustrations  I consider it over priced  But the Logitech Harmony software and approach still make it easier to use than separate component remotes  Conditionally recommended 
This speaker has great sound and pretty good bass  The LED lights are an attribute that put this speaker above others in this same category  The only negative on this is the speaker cannot charge and play at the same time  This isn t a big deal  but it is kind of weird 
My son has really enjoyed playing this game   He loves it 
The remote features are very good  Nice lighted hey board and every device I needed was supported by Logitech  A lot of thought has gone into the layout  I would have given five stars except not having a physical page down  up button is a bit of a drag  You have to use the virtual one buried on the third page of features  One other reason 4 stars not five is because the battery life isn t stellar 
I used to be an avid fan of the Harmony Remote  I ve owned several in the past   but that is no longer the case  Our Ultimate One seemed to work fine at first  and we were pleased  But over time  we ve become less and less satisfied  Something changed over time  and now EVERY time we start an Activity  we need to go to the Fix it myself function because there is always one problem or another with one of the devices  Also  the response time of the devices is MUCH slower with the Harmony than when using the the remote that comes with the device  So  for example  when you press the Play  Pause button during a Fast Forward  it takes about 3 seconds to respond  which forces you to have to Rewind  which is then also delayed when you try to stop it  Usually  we just end up giving up  There is also a problem with the over sensitive recognition of gestures  which causes things to happen when we don t want them to  and therefore must be undone  It has become a frustration to use the Harmony remote  and we frequently end up just using the remotes that came with the devices  Sort of defeats the purpose  don t you think Especially when you consider the cost of this product  We tried to re sync the Harmony Remote to see if that would correct some of the issues we re having  At first the sync ran for hours without completing  The message on the remote said not to disconnect because it was in the middle of an update  but we finally disconnected  reconnected the remote  and the sync finally finished  But  much to our disappointment  all of the problems are still there  The only thing we can think of doing now is to delete all of our devices and activities and re enter them  Since this is time consuming  and should be unnecessary  it only adds to the frustration  This is not the kind of PR Logitech should want for its product 
Controlling three devices simultaneously  TV  Cable Box    Bose Audio  Frequently fails to turn on the cable box or audio device  help works to turn on the failed device  but requires more steps than necessary  Charter Cable digital stations are all three digit selections  the Harmony frequently fails to send all three numbers and may send one or two resulting in an unwanted selection  All this from about 8 feet away from the receiver  Save your money unless you enjoy frustration 
This 8G ram help my mac now because its faster than ever   
Easy to set up  We have gone from 5 remotes to 1  Controls our TiVo without a problem  Awesome remotes
these speakers are great  pretty cheap and have really great sound quality  My old car speakers never had tweeters and would start to distort after level 25 on the pioneer 3400ub  I had to turn the sub off in my car because the bass on these are freaking amazing  The only problem I had was since this was my first install getting the first door panel off was a pain in the but  Other than that everything worked out great and I will keep these things in for a long time
After you set this remote up  it works great
Allows me to have all electronics in a closet and out of sight 
alpine has always been a good quality product  fit into my van nicely
Awesome  New in box  Cheap  Good  60 at Car Toys  so this is a good deal 
does what it should but the screen is too sensetive 
Easy to set up    takes a little getting used to with all the various inputs but overall fairly easy 
Easy to setup but does not work well with the new comcast X1 box 
Easy to setup  Sometimes it does not turn the TV on  I have to do it manually 
good tv
Great
Great remote  
Great seller  but radio not really user friendly 
Having a hard time getting everything to shut down
It looks good and easy to move around 
It met my expectations
Limited by length of wiring but sounds good
Love the size  the picture  sound and overall quality 
Nice remote  I like it a lot  It controls all my devices and activities
Not very easy to use but does work on all my devices 
Numbers on touch screen are hard to use for changing channels 
Sets up nicely  with the exception of a very old CD changer Logo icons for favorite channels are nice 
Setup was a little daunting but it works great 
shouls have bought a smart tv  Not as clear
SOMEWHAT CLUMSY TO USE
Sound great in my 2000 Silverado 
The picture is good but sound could be better 
they sound alright but didntfit very well for my application
Thought this would work with my PS3  doesn t 
TV watching simplified  Little issues every now and then  but not a deal breaker 
Very good 
very smart remote   many options  
Work great except on my smart tv apps
works great
Would be perfect if the number buttons on the screen were more responsive
Everything excellent  except the stand  hence four stars 
I am excited to find this item in Best Buy  A lot of stores no longer carry the tapes  So  thank you Best Buy for continuing to carry this item 
I got this as a Christmas gift and have yet to get it working  The forums have no help or are very vague with solutions  Tech support for Harmony is overseas and Ive spoken with two techs that have less tech knowledge then I do  They tell you things like restart your pc  use another pc  reboot the remote  Hello    Ive tried that already and it didnt work  Anyhow the Harmony One was a great remote  but this Harmony Ultimate is either a lemon or the software is utter trash    Ive wasted hours so far and cant even get into the setup   You have been warned  buy another remote 
Bought this one on recommendation of a Best Buy employee  It fits tight and isn t adjustable  Took it back and bought A Bose night and day difference
As a dog owner  I have often wondered about what happens during times I can t see my dog  What does the dog do during the day if I am not there How does the dog react to various stimuli When exactly does the dog react to the car When I sleep  what is the dog doingWell  I have used other cameras for this purpose  but frankly  that is always a bit sketchy because I have no control over the camera and can t use it in the dark  Needless to say  I was really excited when I saw this camera offered 1  What s in the box  You receive the smaller camera  it is really small   about the size of your palm   plus some instructions and the power pack 2  Aesthetic  This is a functional item  However  besides being pretty small in almost aspect  about the size of your palm   it has a sturdy stand to sit on that you can swivel around  with a microphone on the back that can also be moved quite easily 3  Use The first step after removing the camera is to get it online with your existing wifi network  This was a task I did not look forward to because these types of items typically will take a bit of doing to get going  Here  you are instructed to download the app for the device you have handy  for myself I used a Ipad  and then start the wifi acquisition process  The camera found my wifi network easily but it took a few tries for it to register completion Once the set up was complete  then the camera worked very well  Default settings immediately told me about happening around the camera  This includes both motion and sound  As the app is in place  notifications are sent to your device as often as there is activity Actual use  I tried this in many different environments and times  Of course  there is a camera on this device and the quality is pretty good  although not complete HD  Second  and for me a most welcome part  is the infrared capability  Yes  actual infrared capability  And after testing this over many nights  it works very well  It even picked up both the occasional moth and mosquito flying around at night  It is pretty sensitive The camera has the ability of two way communication though the microphone  you simply hit an icon in the app to talk  and you can also play tunes as well by hitting another icon  In addition  you can take a photo as well if you want  access not yet   I have used the microphone function  and it works pretty well  The camera has provided some real enjoyment and revelation  Different sleeping places  more or less movement that you would think  and some real indications that dogs are pretty pathetic animals without social interaction   they MUST be in a pack for true security  The camera allows you to also watch in real time  With the microphone  you can communicate with your pet  As would be expected  there is a slight delay  2 seconds perhaps so you have to keep that in mind  In addition  there is a temperature monitor  how cool is that  as well Server  The app and computer log in   under the strange and seemingly unrelated name Hubble   provides plenty of access  more on this in bit    give you a timeline to look up various short  typically just about 15 seconds films of your chosen activity  dog  kid  etc  or more if these is a continued stream of activity  Plus  you can also see when there is just a sound   though it does not apparently record the sound  The timeline is ON a server  which means be careful what is recorded with this thing Notifications  When this is powered on  the camera dutifully will tell you what is going on at home or elsewhere around the camera  You will receive a constant stream of alerts  Sometimes this is fine  but other times this will drive you nuts  And apparently there is no way at this time to maneuver the alerts to tamp them down  So  if you are in a business meeting  prepare to be driven crazy with the knowledge you dog has moved around  I expect this will be updated with a app update so this will probably be added later App  The app at this time is pretty basic  You can look at the camera that is powered on and see the timeline of activity  You can simply scroll down and view the desired activity with your app  There is no apparent way to email the clips to yourself that I have found Issue   The app goes to a cloud server  If the camera records something it shouldn t  then you can simply delete the clip by hitting the screen and a delete icon will appear  The camera itself is pretty inconspicuous  so it would be easy to have this record things you may regret later The main point is that you must be really careful with the camera and the server  Second is it would be really terrific to be able to email the clips to yourself so you can edit them and do something with them other than just view the server  In addition  one concern I have is that it looks like there will be a charged service for at least some features as there is a plan tab  currently available is just free  however  Settings Again  at this time  the major issue with the app is it has very limited control  Although there is a tab that has settings  you can t do anything with it  and this means you can t control the notifications  for example  I hope this is addressed in a future software update Overall  I enjoyed fooling around with this camera  The camera and the IF camera are quite sensitive  The microphone  when coupled with the video clips  is quite sensitive  For a dog owner  or cat owner   or whatever   the camera provides an easy  real time  access through which you can see what is happening in your home   or wherever that camera is placed with wifi of course   I have some concerns about server access   I think this needs to be addressed with some further security measures as this is a cloud based service   but overall the experience is a lot of fun I give this a strong 3 5 to 4 stars based on the above  For the technology given  frankly  the cost isn t so expensive  but it is still something you have to think about for purchase  Yet  if you have the inclination  this is a pretty well integrated product 
For the two hour the unit worked     I found the button layout difficult to use and the touch screen slow and clunky After two hour the unit locked up and needed to be defaulted and re configured Sending it back not worth the money 
Wasn t looking to spend a lot of money  small in size but great in sound  Worth the money spent
I purchased this remote from a warehouse store with high hopes that it would rid my coffee table of remote control clutter  We have a Denon receiver  Sony TV  ATT Cable Box  Apple TV  and a Mac Mini in our entertainment center  I was able to successfully program the remote for all of these devices and setup the sequences so that things would turn on and go to the right input The problem was that it didn t work 100 of the time  More than 50 of the time one device or another would fail to turn on  or off   or the input wouldn t go to the right setting  I still had all of my remotes out and if I didn t I had to manually control my devices For the price  this remote should work 100 of the time  I returned it 
Speaker sounds best inside  Product is a little heavy and doesn t seem very mobile  I was on the fence between this and JBL speaker in the same category but was told I sony makes a better sounding speaker and couldn t be happier with the purchase  I went in to the store to test out the speakers and started listening to the sony section and thought it sounded amazing  I then noticed i was listening to the smallest of the sony speaks then was blown away again I was actually listening to the bigger speaker up  Picked up for 124 and couldn t be happier 
I bought this keyboard a few months ago but now it is not working even more  It has a nice layout and features but many times I have to reconnect the keyboard for my surface to recognize the finger scanner and keys especially after it goes to sleep  In addition  I take extremely good care of my things but now when I press certain keys there are multiple key strokes for example  I press the letter c and I get xc  I press 1 and I get 12 and vice versa  Throughout this post I have to be correcting my mistake which I don t have time for  I do not have large fingers and it is only this week it has started to give me the key problem  And for the price I paid especially living outside the US It should be immaculate  I have tried to clean around the keys to the best of my ability  there does not seem to be anything stuck between the x and c  and  1 and 2 keys since they press with ease 
I replaced my factory speakers with these  big improvement 
Bought this a month ago for my Surface Pro 3  Like others have said  it is very good overall but there are a few differences from my original SP3 type cover that I dislike  I m at a loss to explain why they brought back the always a mistake Ins ert  key  and why they moved the HomeEndPage block to place the Ins key over F12 where you are much more likely to mistakenly press it  The Mute and Play  Pause key were switched this is a minor annoyance but still an inconsistency  I presume they moved Mute to be next to the new Volume Up and Down keys that replaced Search and Share  Why did they need VolUp and Dn keys There is already a physical hardware button for that  I almost never used the old middle block of media keys but  besides the new PrtScn key  I wish I had the old keys back and in their old places 
I purchased the Everest Elite 700 took it home then I started noticing the problems immediately 1st  fit test caused a loud squeal from left earcup speaker into my earthat s cheap noise cancellation headphone problem all the other expensive bluetooth headphones do not do that why does your s do this JBL?2nd  I wanted to fold it when I used the headphone after the portability test opened to use again experienced loud crackling from the left earcup until I powered off the headphones 3rd  JBL Phone APP doesn t keep connected to headphone even with BT connection active could not test functionality of JBL app because of the app disconnecting 4th The Everest Elite 700 doesn t like living loud either wanted to try full volume on phone   headphone volume thru bluetooth connection it didn t like that starting withaudible popping at random intervals during music playback Even B3ats Stud1o wireless does much better than these at almost the same pricetag Even the the Turtle Beach El1te 800   800x do better with more functionality Bad show JBL 
Bought this for our 15 year old and he loves it  It has a lot of bass  the battery last a long time  and he enjoys messing with the light colors with his phone Personally  I d want a speaker with more mid range  This has a lot of highs and lows  but the middle is rather weak  Its designed for the pop music he listens to and represents it very well  but for other styles you might want something different 
this system has allowed me to hold class in other venues  The sound is great people tell me they can even make out the words  Thanks for your help in selecting this 
Not easy to setup and options of remotes added are limited  at least the ones I attempted to add  I returned but could be the user that was the problem 
Apple CarPlay is here and it s clean interface is what is going to attract many buyers  I do enjoy the fast and simple interface that functions almost exactly as any Apple product many have come to know  It is the sole reason I personally purchased the deck and overall am quite pleased with it  It is super basic which is understandable to keep the driver s eyes on the road and not the display  For music it s a home run and for navigation it s a bit of a disappointment  There is NO Bluetooth connectivity which is a bit of a bummer and the phone mirrors the app on the screen which is a negative in my opinion  Alpine quality is there  but it s far from perfect 
There s a few things a person should know about this stereo before purchasing it  One  if you don t have an iPhone  you are basically buying a very expensive AM  FM radio  For those with an iPhone  though  this stereo offers the simplest utilization of CarPlay over any other option  You plug in your iPhone and CarPlay opens  No sub menus to work through  It s just there  You also have an AUX option that works with video  if your car is in park  that you can add a DVD player  CD player  XM radio or HD radio to Second  a number of other reviews have pointed out that there is no bluetooth  That s technically correct  but there is a chance of that changing in the near future  The reason why there is no bluetooth currently is because CarPlay has no wireless option  But with iOS 9 launching in the fall  that will be added  and the iLX 007 is prepared to take advantage of it  with a chip included within that is either wifi or wifi  bluetooth hybrid  Either way  Alpine is apparently prepared to release a firmware update and  or bluetooth dongle to make the iLX 007 wireless in the fall  Pioneer is telling customers that their stereos will not be wireless compatible  so that s a big plus for Alpine if it comes to pass Overall  though  I enjoy my iLX 007 and don t regret purchasing it  It s very minimalist  has a 7  capacitive screen and a physical Siri button  I was also able to hook a backup camera to it and steering wheel controls work with it  with an adapter   If you re looking for the same things I was in a double din stereo  namely  CarPlay   this is the one to get  It s a great unit that may get even greater in the near future 
Blue tooth works fairly well  Directions are easy to use 
I need this  so I can connect 3 wifi device and only pay 1 phone line 
Easy to use   Smart move that I choose this one   Black colour matches well
Great product overall  Fingerprint scanner works like a charm  No issues or whatsoever  Great design too 
Stereo is beautiful    LED lights are amazing love it
I made a side by side comparison with five other 50 inch class TVs utilizing different LED  LCD  backlighting combinations  All were in the same price range  This model utilizes LED backlit LCDs  I could visualize  as promised  better contrast and brightness  greater color range  more rapid response to changes in scene and more accurate image rendering  I did disable the Eco Sensor option and increased the judder control  The mobile to tv mirroring and wi fi connection were simple to set up and both performed well for streaming content locally and from the cloud  much better faster than my 2015 40 inch Samsung  The sound is perhaps adequate in a small room  but I was much happier when I plugged in a 250 Yamaha soundbar  It matched up automatically with the TV s Dolby DTS signals  Mounting the TV to my swivel  stand and the soundbar to the TV was straight forward  My only nit is that all of these 40 50 inch TVs have just two 2 HDMI inputs  ugh  That said  for less than 500 I got a TV that compared favorably with other 50 inch TVs costing 100 200 more

Great picture  great sound with no added speakers 
I needed a bigger bag for my camera and lens and had been looking for awhile  This one was in sale so it fit my budget
Love it  Bought on a clearance and holds camera nicely
This fit the bill for me  I don t honestly think it could be better  It has literally replaced all remotes for a 65  Panasonic TV  Fios cable box  Marantz receiver doing audio  video switching  Xbox 360  BluRay Player  a PC and a few other components  It does so as flawlessly as can be expected and has very solid range and breadth of of beam so never misses  I ve even pointed it backwards a foot from cushions  Once it s set up it has my 65 year old mother  father able to use it as well as my 5 year old daughter and 10 year old son  Once programming is done it has vastly simplified things they want to do  Nice customization allows you to use custom icons for various devices and channels  Ability to have two different commands for the same button  press   skip forward and press hold   fast forward   You can also take some or all commands and put them in the touch screen menu for infrequent use  If you are willing to invest a bit of time in this  it s a great and permanent solution One thing to realize  while they have a very nice and intuitive computer based setup  the capabilities of this device make for some time spent programming to set it up  If one isn t tech savvy and  or doesn t have more than 2 main devices  this device may be overkill and using the cable box remote and occasionally grabbing the DVD remote might be the better solution  More succinctly   a  10 inconvenience may not warrant a  250 solution  remote 
Just what I was looking for  It holds the items I use the most  and keeps them organized for easy access  including the special velcroed pocket for extra media cards  The security of having the big gear  camera  flash  etc   compartment not facing the outside  back of the backpack is great  I was even reluctant to buy a backpack due to the thought of having to strap it on  but I find I carry it in my hand by the straps anyway  It s lightweight and maneuverable  and I like that it stands on end without toppling over  Don t know what the key clip is for  though 
Bought a couple of these so I could have one to travel with and one to keep at home for my work laptop  Small price to pay for the extra convenience  Great quality 
It fits with the Lenovo I m using which isn t a Yoga  but it gets really  really hot  Most of the cords do  but this one seems to be worse than others
It holds my camera with 10 inch long lens attached  plus wiring  bellows in the pouch  Also on the sides an assortment of filters and other camera items in small side pockets  The perfect travel bag  
I purchased this bag to carry a newly purchased 200 500 lens and it fits perfectly attached to my D7100 with room for a 35mm and an old 55 300  I was even able to leave the removable zip bag inside to hold the charger and other misc items  Highly recommend 
Fit for my NAS storage system  Easy to install    
Amazing feat of technology  I think these are the same tapes used by the Apollo missions  I can t figure out how the moving pictures are stamped on the tape  perhaps witchcraft  but the oohs and ahhs are always well worth the increased price  They have allowed me to document my howling wolf shirt in many different social situations 
It does everything I had hoped it would and makes scrolling through channels simple even with a tuner as part of my home theater system
Slingbox fairly simple to connect and configure  All equipment required for hookup included in the package 
My first keyboard broke in about 2 months  I did extensive testing on it and determined that it was a hardware failure  the trackpad was the only thing not working   Best Buy was great  They returned the keyboard even though I didn t have a warranty  This was a special case though so I wouldn t expect it  Get that warranty  you may need it  The second one works great btw  No issues at all   1 star for the first one breaking 
this is a terrible remote  I love my Harmony One  and thought I would upgrade to the new model  I returned it in a week  the buttons on top were cumbersome  and hated having to go into the lcd menu so often  Then I would accidentally hit something and would go into diagnostic mode and couldn t get out  I have  TiVo and Harmony one had the buttons at the same spot  and the thumbs up and down at a great location   This remote I had to fight to find it and the 30 second skip which I had to go into the menu again making it worthless 
extra  30 for fingerprint scanner over the regular keyboard   ? hard to say i would miss it if i gotten the regular  the surface pro 4 already has face recognition for loggin into windows  which is extremely convenient  finger print is only useful when i don t want to line my face up with the camera  if print scanner can be use for website logins  then definitely worth it  maybe there s an app for that  I haven t done the research for it  the reader itself is pretty accurate  it usually take the print on the first try 
I got this on sale at same price of regular type cover  Hardly use the fingerprint sensor since the face recognition works so well 
I can now quickly and hassle free log into my surface with finger print scanner  It works every time and i have no problems getting it to recognize my fingerprint  The keys being spaced out is also a huge plus 
make it so much easier to access my sp4 not having to sign in everytime make it huge difference highly recommended  
It took a while for the surface to get to the point where it recognized it each time I started it but it works great  I love the backlighting when my wife is asleep in bed next to me and I m still working
A little extra worth spend for a very convenient login with fingerprint 
I own a Surface Pro 3 and upgraded to the Surface Pro Type Cover with Fingerprint ID after using the original model Surface Pro 3 Type Cover for two years There were no issues with upgrading the Type Cover  The Fingerprint ID option integrates with Windows Hello  allowing me to logon or unlock my screen without typing a password  It s quick and very convenient and worth the  30 added cost because I use it a lot I don t think the Fingerprint ID feature would be as useful with a Surface Pro 4  The infrared camera and facial recognition with Windows Hello provides the same functionality I bought this keyboard as open box  but the keyboard was still like new and I appreciated the extra savings 
I picked this up with a Best Buy price match  which was great Definitely worth spending the extra money for the added convenience of the fingerprint ID Very happy with the purchase 
The finger print ID feature makes signing into Windows effortless and quick  As a field technician I don t always have time to type a password
I have replaced 5 surface pro type covers and the staff love the fact they do not have to type in their passwords each time their tablet goes to sleep 
After a week of having to type my Microsoft password in every time my screen turned off I was ready to scream  The ease of the fingerprint ID on this Type Cover is a life saver  The Keyboard itself has a good feel  The keys have good tension so it s comfortable to type on whether it s on your lap or on your desk  I would like it better if it had a pen loop my surface pen doesn t seem to stick as securely with the Type Cover attached  It would actually garner a rating of excellent if there was some way to keep the cover closed while traveling 
I picked this type cover over the signature type cover due to the fingerprint support  I love the keyboard  but the fingerprint reader is useless  I have only been able to successfully unlock with it one time and even then it took multiple tries  I wish now that I had purchased the signature type cover but do not want to try to exchange it because I will need a keyboard in the mean time 
This unit is not worth the extra money  fingerprint function has not worked since install 
Sometime in the low lighted room the face ID does not recognize your face  The finer print pad works every time  Well worth the extra cost 
Excellent product overall  One of the best type covers I have purchased that being said I would recommend not paying extra for the fingerprint scanner 
Great remote  Works with Sony TV  new Sony 4k dvd player  cable box  and Apple TV  I had the Geek Squad set it up 
Microsoft has the gimmick that says the Surface can replace your laptop  It was 90% there on the Surface Pro 3  the major downside for me being the keyboard  It was a good keyboard  and a great option when it first released  Then after constant use  it worked fine  but never felt like a real keyboard Finally  the latest keyboard  released with the SP4  and works with the SP3  feels fantastic and functions perfectly  It s much sturdier  mouse pad is larger and more sensitive  keys are spaced apart better and feel better  and finally a fingerprint login option  only on black keyboard as of now   Overall  this keyboard is great  We ll see how I feel when SP5 s keyboard comes around    
This product fulfills my needs perfectly  I give it  Five Stars 
Purchased this ram to increase onboard memory  Intalled easily and my computer recognized it immediately  Has worked flawlessly to date  I have used PNY products in the past with great success 
they still stock dvc tape  sony makes great product  not many choices out their 
Probably a nice television  but not as advertised  Doesn t look like the picture  I contacted Amazon to check about the base  and despite clear assurances  the TV arrived with two little feet and not a central base  Amazon was gracious about the return 
I owned 2 Harmony One and this is my 3rd Logitech  after 1 month of usage  I can say that this is really an improvement over the Harmony One  this Ultimate One responds faster  feels like you use the stock remote  the touch screen is perfect  you can set up the activity of the touch gesture like a smart phone  like Activator on jailbroken iPhone The new software My Harmony is also an unbelievable upgrade over the old one However  if the remote support Unicode to use in other country like me  Vietnam   it will be perfect  besides the screen is also quite small when the words are big  sometime you can not name your devices in full
Keys feel like a full size keyboard  don t use the touchpad but the fingerprint reader works as advertised 
The keyboard has a great feel with it s elevated keys  The only drawback so far is that the fingerprint reader tends not to work whenever I wake the computer from sleep or standby 
This type cover feels good for a detach set up  keys are quiet 
Easy to program and operate  Works well and keeps us informed
Slim and works great a must have   I put it in bac kUse off end h I ve a full charge every time 
I m a border line headphone snob I can tell the difference between good head phones  and sub par headphones  and I LOVE these headphones  They were easy to set up  easy to connect  have great sound quality  and I have yet to have to recharge them  I have been able to pair them with all my devices  and they continue to connect without problem  When I got them I was a little hesitant because some on ear headphones press on my cartilage piercing so hard that it hurts  but these are super comfortable  and stay on my head without being super tight 
Have always owned Harmony remotes in the past due to having multiple components to my home theater system and this guy is great  My only disappointment is the lack of battery life  I wish it lasted longer than a week before charges but atleast it s rechargeable 
I bought this remote to have one feature  favorite channels  I don t have a good memory for channel numbers  and tapping once on a touchscreen button is far easier than looking up the number and entering it quickly enough on the DirecTV remote  The one improvement I added to it is a small blob of UV activated glue on the mute button so that I can grab the remote and very quickly mute or unmute the TV by feel alone  I m bummed out that according to another review  Harmony remote buttons don t last long  but I ll deal with that when the time comes  For right now  I m completely delighted with it 
They sound great  The app that is free to download also is fantastic and easy to use  Only complaint is the carrying pouch it comes with  For premium headphones  I feel like there should be a hardcase 
My old USB adapter was the Netgear A6210 and I thought connecting at 833MB  s was fast  With the A7000  I now connect at 1 3GB  s  1300MB  s  
It is quick  and was a good price from Best Buy  My former dell torched the mother board  Fortunately  Best Buy had one on the shelves 
Love it  Better than the personal hotspot on my phone
Installed these into my mid 2012 MacBook Pro and it is now much faster  I would recommend getting the 16gb in which they didn t have at the time 
This memory increase my computerspeed  good price
Fast Wifi connection powers my computer and other devices
I bought these to increase the RAM on my Mac desktop  Easy to install and made that spinning ball a thing of the past 
This is was a upgrade for my HP desktop went from 8 to 16 GIGs of RAM  supper fast response and has been a great help to online gaming  No issues installing and is straight plug and play 
Update for my Mac and it has definitely made a difference 
when i loaded this up in my pc i noticed how fast it ran instantly
This has been a great addition to my desktop  Lightning fast and no problems 
Got here 2 DAYS EAELY  Was not expecting it  got it set up and working like a charm  Perfect condition  For its price  It s much better to but the thing separately than doing it on a 2 year contract  10  10 would recommend to a friend
Like my new Dell Computer  loads quickly  very good response time  only fault was cheap keyboard so have a better keyboard  Dell upgrades their software which is a plus 
Works well for my Samsung Galaxy Edge  Small  light and thin charger 
Bought this RAM to increase the memory for a ESXi computer  that I made out of an HP desktop I purchased at Best Buy  The RAM has been solid  and I maxed out the memory of 32GB  I haven t had any issues  and it runs very cool under load 
Easy to install desktop computer     lots of USB ports also 
This adapter works great  I get over 100 mbs speed  It never loses connection  Very impressed  If you need a WiFi adapter this is the one to get 
Excellent internet connection on my old PCU   works great 
This product was Simple to Install  not much assembly to it  it has a slim design  and seems durable and stable for a large TV  it is a full motion mount so It allows good viewing from many angles 
Great ram  Very fast  Expensive but worth it if you need a quick upgrade
I ve been a fan of Samsung tvs for quite some time now  This one far exceeded expectation  The picture is amazing   Sound is actually pretty darn good as well  Arrived quickly  well packaged  Easy set up  comes with the usual smart tv apps  Adjusts brightness in accordance with ambient light   does this very well  Quite pleased wth this purchase 
I LOVE music and enjoy a wide variety of  Flavors   genres   I sold my old home and it s integrated whole house sound system  got busy and was drifting away from music      Well  I had no interest in buying a little speaker to Bluetooth my iPhone  They looked like a gimmick  Then a friend played his smartphone music on his portable speaker  I decided to check some speakers out  Then I checked some more     lots more  Absolutely I trusted my ears  This Sony speaker sound is FANTASTIC and POWERFUL to me  It is so simple by design  yet packed with versatile features  including Link  Network  Bluetooth  USB  Audio jack  Google Cast  Software upgrades when needed  and the ability to pair in Stereo to a second Sony speaker  The sound is distinctly different when you push Extra Bass  Both envelopes are great  You can release the speaker grille with a small toggle  ITS A HOOT to see those small speakers working  belting out a great sound  With my Pandora  Apple Music  and Shazam  I am in music heaven       
As a bit of an audio nut I picked up these and some C5s at the same time  They both fit the ways you d expect  with these wanting a much better source than my Note 3  and the C5s shining on either source  The audio on these is incredible on a decent source  On my phone there is good quality  but not the  sitting right next to a live band  feel you get when these have the power they want  I ll go more in depth on some particular songs at the end  but first comfort  As someone with goofy large ears and a big noggin  these are comfortable for a couple hours if I don t have my glasses on  With my glasses on  they are a bit tight and very noticeable after an hour and a half or so  The build is fantastic and the case is nice  Very luxurious head phones to look at for sure  As far as songs go  I don t have a dedicated external headphone amp yet  still deciding which route to go  but these were listened to off of my programming  gaming rig which has an Asus ROG motherboard which has a decent headphone amp built in Make Them Suffer Elegies  I am a metal head primarily and this is probably my baseline song because there is a ton going on  This song is an atmospheric story telling of how the vocalist lost someone very near and dear to him  his screams  the furious instrumentals  the sad piano  and explosive breakdowns typically put headphones to the test  These pass that test very well  They capture the music in a big way  Every instrument has it s place and the atmosphere is flawlessly created for a heartwrenching experience Hans Zimmer  The Dark Knight soundtrack is incredible on these  Really nothing more I can say other than if you have ever seen an orchestra perform this type of music in an auditorium  that is how these headphones sound  Incredible Magna Carta Holy Grail  I don t really like or listen to rap much  but this song is well produced so it s a good test  These wouldn t be the ideal rap headphones to say the least  the piano and JT really sound awesome  the bass is not incredibly powerful  these are very much rock and classical headphones  which is perfect for me  but if you listen to electronic or rap  I would look into V Moda Crossfades or Sol Reoublic Master Tracks Overall  if you listen to music deep into instrumentals and singing or screaming vocals  these are perfect 
Great quality headphones  I was surprised by how much noise they cancelled  Get a pair today 
Controls all of my components  Easy to program and easy to modify your program  Picked it up on sale for 99 99  Couldn t be more pleased
I purchased the lower model at first and upgraded for the better sound   love the ability to pair them 
Absolutely love this TV    Picture quality is amazing  speakers work great  overall design is neat and clean  Setup menus are easy to navigate and the smart TV features make watching movies and TV shows conveniently easy 
Got these along with a set of Alpine SPE 6090s and a Pioneer DEH X6500BT head unit   it sounds really great 
I bought this bc my last portable speaker  HEX 808  wasnt cuttin it for me as far as sound goes and connection issues  Checked this out in store   picked it over the JBL Charge 3  Cant say whether or not its better than that speaker but I can say that for a portable speaker this one is great  Can def recommend  
I have 2 pairs of these  They are very comfortable  and for a bluetooth headphone  they sound is incredible  There s just one problem    I have to replace them every 3 months  They have that JBL sound we love  but the electronics are shoddy and JBL doesn t seem to want to fix this  All 3 units have been sent back for just failing out of the blue  They just magically stop turning on and won t charge or anything    and this is usually after 2 6 months  I am a casual user  so they re still brand new when they die  JBL will only honor the warranty for 1 year after the purchase price  even though my second unit is being replaced a second time in 3 months for the same manufacturer defect  So  you ll spend a couple hundred plus tax on a pair of headphones that won t even be burned in when they die  and then you re just expected to purchase another set for the same price that will do the same thing  I keep them in their case  They never get wet or thrown around or abused  They re expensive and I treat them as such    but they still just   stop    working out of the blue  JBL is aware of this issue but doesn t seem to fix it  Keep the receipt and buy the Best Buy plan if you buy these  You ll need both 
I�ve used multiple Bluetooth speakers in my years and I would say that the MEGABLAST rates right up there in the top The most important feature to me off the bat is the music quality  I listen primarily to classic rock and heavy metal and the highs on the output were very crisp  The bass was very punchy and pronounced but I felt at times that the the low end wasn�t filling in on louder volumes  full disclosure  I tend to listen to music loud  When I listened to acoustic songs  the crisp sound sounded beautiful and it was a very pleasurable experience The unit structure itself is incredible solid  I like when electronics have a dense feel  the only thing I would say is that it actually packs some weight behind it  I also found the battery life to be phenomenal The app itself is a little cumbersome in the flow of things while using an iPhone  and other apps didn�t stream out  like Instagram videos   but maybe there�s a little more tweaking I have to go through This is the first time that Uve really used Alexa and I have to say I just might try it more and more  The microphone picked up my voice pretty easily  even while playing music at my high volunes  which was a huge plus Overall I recommend anyone looking for a solid and rugged base  nice sounding music  and especially if you are hooked into Amazon�s Alexa 
I really enjoy the sound and noise cancellation in these headphones 
Sony is underrated in terms of sound quality for their speakers  and this is no exception  GREAT for travel  sounds fantastic  long battery life 
We bought this speaker for our golf cart instead of installing a radio in it  The speaker sounds great  is easy to set up and over all well worth the money 
This is the 2d Harmony One I ve purchased  I ve had my original one for 3 years and loved it  so when we visited our Son and family  and saw how frustrated they were with multiple devices  I bought one for them as a surprise  They are so thankful 
I ve only had the Slingbox M2 for two days  but I can t believe how well it works  The streaming quality on my Sprint mobile phone is far better better than any other streaming app I have  It seems to stay strong in locations whose poor signal quality would knock any other app out  It practically doesn t buffer at all  and the sound and picture quality are great 
This is my 4th harmony remote and the best one so far  Touch screen is nice and sensitive  The only downside to it is the FF and RW buttons on the top of the remote  Not sure what they were thinking on this one  You can use the touch screen for this purpose but I like my old buttons better 
When paired with the Harmony Hub this remote is amazing  Very easy setup  The only reason I didn t give 5 stars is because  a like all other Harmony remote products  this device is seriously expensive 
I wanted a remote that could handle all of my electronics and this one fits the bill  It handles all the equipment  It is easy to use and has a help button that will trouble shoot any issues  I have not had any   I could not be happier with this remote 
I m a long time Harmony remote user  This will be the 4th model  upgrade I ve had  with the most recent being the Harmony One  My understanding is that this remote is similar to the Harmony Touch  and Identical to the remote in the Harmony Ultimate package  with the IR Hub  The big possible deal breaker here is the lack of a physical number pad  I realize that can be a deal breaker for some people  but it s an obvious change and you know what you re getting in that regard The device itself feels very well built  I like the ergonomics  but that s a matter of opinion of course  Aside from the physical number pad  you are short a couple of physical buttons that appear on some other models  but in exchange you have the wonderful feature of being able to assign a long and short press to each physical buttons  distinguished by a nice haptic feedback   allowing you to set a great deal of commands  The other great feature compared to my previous remote  is the ability to add and remove commands  and rearrange the screen on the device itself  without having to connect to a PC  You still need to sync to a PC to change the physical buttons  but it s still a welcome addition The tilt sensor  which wakes the device when you pick it up  is also much more sensitive and functional than my old Harmony One  which almost required a shake  A small thing  but again nice Some complain about the media controls  play  FF  RW  etc  being at the top of the remote  I don t find it that much of an issue  Plus  the touchscreen allows you to set EXTREMELY helpful gesture commands  which again can be setup from the device itself   The options for gestures are TapDouble TapSwipe LeftSwipe RightSwipe UpSwipe DownSwipe Left and holdSwipe Right and holdSwipe Up and holdSwipe Down and holdSo by simply assigning swipe left and right as FF and RW  and tap as Play  Pause  you have a nice alternative if the button layout bothers you  But again  I find the physical key positions are easy to get used to Lastly  there are the usual customization features  most of which are either implemented better  or at least more easily than previous models  such as custom screen wallpapers  customer activity icons  unavailable on the Harmony one   etc  All in all  while the ergonomics and on screen number pad may be a bit unusual at first  it s a fantastic remote  Go and pick up and hold one in person at a store if possible  so you know what it feels like  But function wise  it s exactly what you d expect if you have experience with Harmony remotes in the past Oh  one last thing  the Battery isn t replaceable  Never a great product decision in my mind  but I had my Harmony One for almost 5 years and it still held a charge for several days without issue  so i m not overly concerned  The battery also doesn t last quite as long as my old Harmony one  possibly due to the larger screen   but for me that means about 2 or 3 days  instead of 5 or 6  which is not really an issue So in summary  I ve previously loved each Harmony remote I ve owned more than the last  This case is a little different though  My last Harmony was definitely an incredible remote and each of my previous remotes were definite improvements over each other  However  in this case I d say this one is less of an objective improvement  and more of a change or alternative style in remotes  There are a few extra features for sure  But just looking at the physical remotes and their core functionality  I d say that the Harmony Ultimate remotes and the old Harmony One are equal and it would come down to preference  mostly in regards to the feel of the buttons and the ergonomics  
This is the best remote I have found for use on multiple devices with different settings for activities 
This remote was an easy setup and operates all of my AV equipment smoothly  No issues whatsoever 
Easy to use and fast mifi  Love it  We used it during a recent power outage and it worked like a charm  Fantastic battery life 
Great outdoor speakers with full sound  Best I ve had 
I ve been waiting 4 years for my home theater set up  Adding this Harmony remote totally accentuates everything about it  I love it and my partner  who is technology challenged  finds it easy to use as well  It s easy to program and when you add the app on our iPhones  it just couldn t be simpler  Bravo to Logitech for a great product that I will enjoy for years 
Love the backlighting  finger print sign in and quick attachment  detachment feature 
Brilliant product  I have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a AV receiver  Roku  DVD  and fairly new Motorola DVR from FiOS and this configured and handled them all perfectly   the first time I set it up The genius of the product is that it s programmed online and Logitech has thousands of components already identified   and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a look up utility on their site  I wasn t sure about my Pioneer VSX 33TX THX receiver as it s probably 10 years old  but it was no problem  You connect the remote to your computer  Windows 7 found the drivers online without issue  then go to the Logitech setup site and create an account if you don t already have one  Then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have  If your setup is simple that may be all you need to do  but they take care of multiple  keypress  needs very elegantly  For example  to play a DVD I have to change the plasma display to HDMI 2  set the AV receiver to DVD input  then turn on the DVD  Logitech s setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that I d probably be using so all I needed to do was to confirm and save  Then a single touch to the onscreen display on the Harmony does it all Be aware that like most IR remotes  it wants a pretty straight line of site to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal  My components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about 12 feet from our seating area and remote control wasn t a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet  If you re not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming  pick up and install an IR repeater and it will solve that problem Honestly  I have nothing negative to say about this device  The ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed  The 200 seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical button only remote can take hours and I had this set up in 15 minutes  it quickly seems like money well spent 
bought the tv to use as a monitor for my gaming computer and has no problem with anything i play 
The keyboard with the fingerprint id works great and adds extra security on your table 
The best sounding headphones I have ever bought  The sound quality is awesome and so realistic you can here everything clearly   Bowers and Wilkins never disappoints me
Upgraded from a 650 and def worth it  Rechargeable batteries are a must 
Product is a good value and suitable for my needs  I like the color  the structure and it s capabilities
Love this desktop  I went from a Dell all in one that was less than a year old that frequently crashed  had horrible screen resolution  and lagged with more than one application open at a time  This desktop is great 
Highly recommend this computer  Video card is a little old  but the chip and board are state of the art  I installed a little more RAM and a SSD  easy enough to do  including moving the operating system to the SSD  saving some money and building something that will last for many years of home and professional use 
Got this set after my B W P5 s bit the dust after 3 years  The over the ear design  and revised driver make a huge difference  I have tested these on a number of different devices  and they definitely would benefit greatly from an AMP  DAC  These sound great with all different types of music  my personal favorite is classical  Bass and sub base are strong and accurate  but not disruptive  High s are crisp and tight  Mid s are strong but can be muddy at times  Overall  this is the best headphone I have owned  I will forever be faithful to B W 
I love that I don t have to set my bag on the ground anymore  Just swing it around and everything is at my fingertips  I have everything in the bag I could ever need  with room for even more  like my iPad and mobile phone  Just an outstanding design 
Excellent device to go to the beach swimming pool or a park etc   spectacular design smooth texture and dynamic speakers  Real extrabass  musical sharpness in bass and treble  usb port to recharge cellulars  Long battery life Tip  It s something heavy for your size surely because of the energy storage capacity of your battery  Lights never go out       But is great Bluetooth Speaker 
Pull it out of the box  go to the web sight  enter the make and model of components  and the remote programs itself  Works instantly  I was able to put 5 remotes in the drawer  What s better? Anyone can pick up the remote and watch cable  a dvd  or Netflix with a push of a button    
Easy to set up  a must have product  One remote is all you need  no more multiple remotes for your devices  A real life saver 
Before I had this adapter  I had an M 2 wifi adapter that came pre installed into my PC when I first bought it  After repositioning it in my house  I came to realize that my computer s download and upload speeds were a tenth of what they used to be and signal strength was in the toilet  After I got this Netgear adapter and took out the M 2 adapter  my wifi signal returned to it s former glory  I do game on my computer and experience little to no lag whatsoever when playing multiplayer  Very good product
Great gadget to solve remotitis    Everybody needs one 
Nice keyboard  Find the fingerprint scanner useful
This replaces an older Samsung that couldn t maintain a connection with any device for more than 30 minutes  With this new one  I can leave it on at my vacation home for days   as long as I m there   and surf the web and stream on two TVs  Incredibly good and easy to use too 
Used to upgrade a slow MacBook Pro and worked great 
I got this remote for Christmas and it broke within 2 days wouldn t even turn on anymore  I charged it for another day with no results and even tried the reset instructions online  Basically tried everything to get this remote going again  It was awesome for the time I had and was really excited about it  but it was a fail  I also didn t like that I had to download software and plug a usb to a computer  Who even own s computers nowadays everything is reliant on apps and tablets  So needless to say I returned it and got my money back 
It was false advertising  Shows Howard and football on box but you can t get on the receiver  Very disappointed
It was false advertising  Shows Howard and football on box but you can t get on the receiver  Very disappointed
I wish the buttons on the screen were easier to use  I also have trouble holding the unit  It is slippery 
Delivered on time  Product as described  Fairly easy to program 
I think this product works good when you have basic devices to control  I had a Samsung sound bar that it would not control  Not helpful as you don t know this until you buy it and try to program it 
Needs a real waist belt and a rain cover  Otherwise it was great for its intended use 
It doesn t seem to know all the commands  functions my devices are capable of 
First time customer of PNY  really disappointed with the quality of this  although this is the only 2 sticks of RAM I ve gotten from them thus far  RAM came in faulty  and I only realised it after a few days of using it  with constant crashes  and computer freezing randomly when using this RAM  Hopefully customer service can help me out and offer a refund  because I need a working computer  and can t wait for 3 weeks for the RMA Review will be updated if problem is corrected 
When first used  it was great  Subsequently  the device stopped working  requiring Geek Squad assistance which means a complicated scheduling process  and ultimately  extra expense  Settle for a simpler device  the software for this one seems too complex  requiring multiple software updates that don t always correct the problem 
I bought this unit for my 2006 HD Road Glide as the original HD unit was hard to hear and the display went dark so could not see what adjustments I was making  After 3 days of working in some of the muggiest weather and going back and forth 20 miles one way to get tools clips and other crap as I have never installed a stereo on a bike before or stripped my bike down quite as far as this but wanted to make sure everything was as professional looking as possible  Also was really looking forward to thumb controlled Bluetooth music rather than aux plugin with no easy way to select music  So I get all finished up today and the plunkin faceplate does not catch  stuck on ejection of the faceplate   I did get it to finally catch and I really loved the sound and the bluetooth hookup made me a little giddy  Took it out for a spin and almost lost the faceplate on the very first bump  This unit arrived this way and I do not know if the problem is in the faceplate or the receiver as nothing looks broken off  This sucks as the whole grand total came out to 400 00 for the stereo  thumb control retainer and installation conversion kit  Dash and wire harness   So now I have to call to try and have this resolved 
I have had my Surface Pro 4 since the beginning of 2016  I have had my type cover for 2 months and I absolutely love the combination  I wanted the type cover because I use my Surface in board meetings and court rooms where it is important to present a classy professional appearance  The type cover has a great feel and looks great 
The speakers are fabulous  Incredible sound  We couldn t be more satisfied  
I purchased the Utlimate One several weeks ago and have been extremely satisfied  The battery is long lasting  the features are great  and it is nice putting away the four remotes again It is a little pricey but worth it 
I recieve several compliments from friends and neighbors  The sound is crystal clear and looks s great  Throws plenty of sound around my pool area kids even say they can here when under water 
I love this remote as it is extremely easy to use 
I m so disappointed in this Samsung TV  I just got it today and set it up only to find out the Smart Hub where all the apps are accessed does not work  I called Samsung customer service about the issue and I was told by a representative that this particular model is faulty where users try to access the Smart Hub and nothing happens  The rep then proceeded to tell me that it is a known issue and their engineers are working on fixing it  So I asked how long the issue was known and the rep said for a week  He told me I can either return the TV to Amazon for a refund or wait until the engineers come up with a solution  So I asked him  why Amazon did not pull this particular model from their inventory and he said he could not comment on that  So I have concluded that either Amazon knew about the issue and still sold the product as advertised even though the smart features are missing  this is considered false advertising and illegal  or they didn t know and the fault lies with Samsung soley  On top of all of that The rep could not give me a time frame for when the issue would be fixed and there is a real possibility it can t be fixed  So now I have this basic tv that does none of the things I purchased it for  Lets just say I m livid  Please people  save yourself the time  money  and frustration and do not buy this model  
It has an extraordinary design  also its image is excellent with a low price  it is perfect for furniture where the base is in limited space
The Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker provides amazing lighting to go with any sort of music that you re playing  provides a small and portable design  making it super easy to be taken anywhere  even near water  a little water won t hurt this speaker   and the battery power to keep the music going all night  or day  long  The sound is amazing and if you need an extra kick up in Bass  all you have to do is hit the EXTRA Bass button on the far left of the speaker  Simple  easy  and doesn t distract you from doing whatever you re already doing Connecting to the speaker is easy  you can either connect via Bluetooth or if you prefer  make sure you have NFC  Near Field Communication  turned on for your device and just bring the device and speaker close to one another and bam  you re connected and ready to play music or whatever audio you want to play  The speaker can be connected to smartphones  tablets  computers  and pretty much everything else with Bluetooth connectivity  You can even connect up to 10 other Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers together  creating a Party Chain of Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers  Or make it simple and connect another Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker for wider stereo sound  Or if you want to skip  or don t have Bluetooth or NFC  connecting wirelessly  you can always connect a 3 5mm cable into the AUX port in the back of the speaker To further customize your Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker  you can install the Sony companion app that can be installed on your device so you can control more features and settings on the speaker  You can turn off or change the mood lighting used by the speaker  you can change the timer for when the speaker turns off on its own after being inactive for a certain period of time  and you can even turn the speaker off with the companion app if you re not near the speaker 
This product really out performs all my other bluetooth speakers  I was a bit skeptical at first and almost bought the  99 version  but ended up with the  149 SB   Clear rich sound and great battery life 
This remote is excellent  Great feel and great look  I ve combined it with a hub to control a full complement of components hidden in my A  V closet  including an IR to Insteon bridge    while sending IR from the Ultimate One directly to the wall mounted display  Had some early firmware issues with a Harmony Smart Control I m using in another room  but those have apparently been resolved 
Works fine but seems to be too expensive for what it does 
Expected more from this unit  Reception no stronger than the 6 year old netgear replacement
The settings for each device are abysmal  Commands are left out that are critical My DVR needs the colored buttons  which are NOT programmed by Harmony  Good luck figuring out how to keep the program and add new buttons to be learned  The colored buttons are in the WRONG order and almost every service uses the same configuration The design by having the sensitive touch screen in the middle of buttons may be the absolute worst engineering design by Logitech ever The harmony software aborts and will not install properly on my Win 10 machine  I have to run it from the userapps folder after a failed install The backlight for volume and channel is the label   in the dark the arrow pads you actually press are invisible in the dark  BAD Finally  the Favorites area of the device itself has ONLY what appear to be channels that are advertisement  paid for  You must manipulate this in the on line software   unfortunately for my provider  COX  only about half the channels are in their database This remote is a disaster Ray Super Remote is far better at all these issues  It does take some getting used to  no buttons only touch screen 
this product is really user freindly and works well for us on the patio
I ve had my headphones for several months now  Overall  I am happy with my purchase  The build quality is great and they are mostly comfortable  They are a little on the heavy and warm side  but acceptable  The sound quality is great as well 
Excellent product  The buttons feel nice in my hand 
Terrific sound quality  Heavy duty construction with great wireless and noise canceling features  In my opinion far better than similar Beats headphones  and arguably better than Bose 
Took an old car and made it new again with an awesome quality radio and speaker purchase  College student is happy again to be driving the older car  Tunes and sound quality made a huge difference  
This remote rocks   having said that  not as good as the 900 but solid   it s the best one out there right now unless you want to overpay for the 900 
Like new  Excellent quality for the price 
I have a suburban with 100x4 running the highs  I use 2 pair of these in the rear and front  Phase is excellent  I have 2 pro 12 s and an alpine 500x1 running bass  My truck hits 138 db and my amps are turned to half  Alpine cut right through the bass when cranked up 
Easy to use and is an excellent product  Have used a jet pack for a couple of years and it works great 
Exactly what I needed  Working great as of now  Would recommend 
The finger print scanner works great and is quick to recognize you   Keyboard very responsive and being back lit is awesome and it s very bright
I own the full previous Sony line of speakers for wireless streaming all over my house    SRS HG1  kitchen   SRS X77  office   it blends nicely   SRS X88  bedroom    SRS X99  living room   and now  the SRS ZR7  foyer  entryway   These are GREAT speakers  excellent fidelity  and while they re not cheap by any means  you really get what you pay for  Heavy  high quality builds and excellent sound  that are also classy looking and compliement your d�cor  Sony s  Music  app on iOS allows you to adjust all sorts of settings  and rename your speakers however you like  which affects how they show up on AirPlay lists and GoogleCast   Note  The ZR7 is not AirPlay or AirPlay 2 compatible   It s not the best app  but it works for making all of the adjustments  You can stream directly from Apple Music or Spotify without having to use Sony s Music app at all  If you have the money  and you re looking for a great sounding speaker that will last for years   this IS the way to go  I have a Denon receiver and all Klipsch speakers for my home theater system  but I use these Sony speakers for wireless music throughout the house and I love it   excellent sound  also Hi Res audio capable  except the X77   If you re looking for heavy bass  invest in a subwoofer   heavy bass mixed into a small ish speaker   lackluster for sound  Overly heavy bass generally drowns out the high end and diminishes fidelity  The ZR7  and the X88  have good bass though  and customizable EQs if you want to emphasize that end of the spectrum  So  if you re looking for something more high end without spending ridiculous amounts of money  that have excellent sound and that will last for years to come  look no further

I have a Surface Pro 3 and love it  I am an avid user and computer support technician  I have replaced my older Acer I7 laptop with this one  it is quicker and much lighter  I had an older type cover  SP3  which I used and was happy with it except for the touchpad  The newer SP4 touch keyboard with fingerprint is much better  more responsive  feels much more like a normal keyboard and the fingerprint reader gives me near instant access to my desktop  I rate it as Fantastic 
I can watch my favorite shows everywhere  It was easy to install
It is easy to manipulate for various viewing angles  Allows the TV to lie flat against the wall but easily extends for the comfort of the viewer  Could not be more pleased with the purchase 
SOUNDS GREAT  BEST INVESTMENT I MADE ON A SONY PRODUCT 
have nothing to say about it  it is really excellent   
Jet pack exceeds my expectations  I would highly recommend it 
Initially  I was taken back by the price since my friends had portable chargers which were far less expensive   12  15   but in the end you get what you pay for  I have no complaints about this charger  It charges itself rather quickly  and holds the charge if i don t use it for a few days  It also quickly charges my phone which is a huge plus  My friends which had the far less expensive portable chargers constantly had problems  and their chargers was not able to fully charge their phones back to 100%
Excellent sound  Speaker feels and sounds solid  Not bass heavy  I have mostly great luck with Sony products If you love your music  buying this will certainly be worth your hard earned cash 
I purchased this mouse to play video games on my laptop  I love that you can customize the colors on the mouse  So far the mouse has performed well on every surface I ve tried it on  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless gaming mouse 
Our Logitech G 403 Prodigy Wireless Gaming Mouse works FLAWLESSLY 
I love these wireless headphones  I use them everyday  my partner complained about trying to sleep while I watched TV late at night  since I ordered these no more complaints
I would actually give these 4 1  2 stars if I could  These are the best headphones I have ever heard from B W  greatly improved from their closed in  overly warm earlier models  The P7 wireless still have a somewhat elevated bass  but control and slam in the bass region is excellent and the elevated bass does not muddy the excellent midrange  Highs are very good also  Imaging not a pinpoint as the Sennheiser Momentum wireless  but also very good  Superior bluetooth range  and interference when it does occur is not as  busy  as on the Momentums   instead of a series of dropouts and digi noise as on the Senns  I usually only get a simple dropout of signal   much less annoying  Everything is improved a bit in wired mode  the bass is even better controlled  making them less warm while improving slam even more  midrange   highs also improve  Best ear pads ever   very deep and the foam forms a nice seal which is very effective for blocking outside noise  there is no Noise Cancelling in these as in the Momentums   Clamping force is very strong at first  which helps with the seal  which may be off putting to some  These are excellent headphones  especially for Bluetooth headphones  but I find the Momentums a tad more refined and prefer them slightly to the P7  However  they are close enough in quality that it is a matter of taste I think  and many will prefer the B W   you can t go wrong either way 
this was easy to install and has very good range  I have it in the basement office and usually internet is iffy  This adapter allows me to go online and stay online  Very pleased with it 
Recent AMD build is located so neither an either net cable or power line adapter are practicable  Using a old USB adapter  n  I was able to connect to inter net at only 80% of the speed with a wired connection  and experienced frequent drop outs  Using this adapter there was no difference in speed to a wired connection  and no drop outs 
Bought this for better wireless AC reception and happy to report it is great  Locks on to signal and is noticeably stronger and faster than other USB adapters I tried 
The weather radio has really come in handy  It has already warned me about severe weather  It was a replacement for one I have had for many years  I highly recommend it because it gives one a good advance warning of impending bad weather and allows one to make preparations for safety 
I have a Midland wx radio I have owned for several years that was problem free and gave great service and wanted another for a bedroom that could be set up for my county only for severe weather alerts  This model works great and is very easy to set up and has a good easy to understand owners manual  would highly recommend 
I stream my cable channel from my home to another location using Apple TV  Sometimes have lag but if you use the same cable provider  system functions better 
Easy to use with high quality picture  Would highly recommend this television 
The stock speaker in my driver side door quit working in my  03 Trailblazer because of the door chime  so I purchased a set of these to replace it  I had to make some minor modifications to the stock GM bracket to mount them but it was absolutely worth it  They sound much better than the pitiful stock ones  They have excellent bass response and clear highs  They are definitly worth the price 
Excellent value  bought 32gb for  260Ram overclocks to 3000mhz   1 35v 15 15 15 36Definitely worth the money
Purchased this radio as a replacement for my faulty factory Volvo system  I could not be happier with the performance of this system and how easy it is to use with either an Apple or Android device 
The components  assembled  easily per the instructions and it sounds great with a lot of features   
We had borrowed a similar product from a friend and loved it  When we saw this  with portable charging  we were happy to get it  Excellent for traveling and also if you need mobile charger 
Installed two pairs of these speakers to replace OEM speakers  Huge difference  Added on the alpine power pack along with the new deck  Plenty of power to drive these four new speakers
I bought this remote to replace my Harmony 650 that stop syncing with my devices  It was easy to setup with the Harmony software  I was able to migrate the settings from my Harmony 650 to this remote with no issues  I have been using the remote for almost 2 weeks now and it works perfectly 
Pros Feels good in the hand with a good grip on the bottom Charging cradle is small and allows for low profile All of the buttons have a backlight  which helps in a dark room The sensors are quick at reacting when you pick the remote upCons No removable battery  you have to hope it lasts and rely on their charging cradle Lack of physical buttons  While most of your needs are done through the touchscreen  theres only limited physical buttons The IR sometimes seems to be weak  Some of my devices sit low and I have to tilt the remote for them to read the signal  which also makes the touchscreen hard to see 
This Universal Remote Control up to 15 entertainment devices with this Logitech Harmony Ultimate One 915 000224 universal remote  which features a 2 4  color touch screen that simplifies option selection  Favorite channel icons let you quickly access frequently used channels  THIS IS AN ALL INCLUSIVE REMOTE CONTROL  GET RID OF YOUR OTHER THOUSAND REMOTES  THE HARMONY ULTIMATE ONE IS ALL YOU NEED   ONE REMOTE LITERALLY 
Very easy to program and works flawless also customizable
Using this type cover for the Surface Pro 4  The fingerprint scanner works well and the keyboard has a good feel during typing 
Excellent picture quality  Lots of gee wiz stuff I don t use  Sound quality of the built in speakers is poor  but I use an external sound system and it sounds great 
Not much more to say     Samsung makes a fabulous TV and this one is perfect for the guest bedroom 
The Samsung was purchased to replace an older model Tv in our basement workout area  It is a great TV 
Bought this TV for gaming and was not disappointed  Great picture overall 
Very pleased with my purchase of this TV it has an excellent picture  great sound  and set up was a breeze 
I bought this yesterday and love it  Beautiful picture and easy to set up 
This Smart TV is smarter than I am  Paired with Cox Contour it s been a good fit for me  It  s a 32 inch screen that works perfectly well in my bedroom  The color is vivid  but one mustn t sit too close to the screen  The detail shows every flaw in the faces of network news anchors  Airbrushing makeup doesn t quite cut it with this higher HD definition  It s a wonderful television  And the price is certainly right  You won t be disappointed 
Gift recipient was very happy with the TV itself  Excellent performance  as expected Shipped a month after time of order though  For a gift  this was extremely late 
Excellent tapes  will come in handy for business  
Completely easy to use and install  Works great in my vehicle 
we had heard about this but didn t really know how it worked   nowwe know    we love it    
I needed a good stereo without a CD player and this item fit the bill  Easy to use and great sound 
I love this system  The only thing that surprises me with it though  is it has only one disc capability  The sound is awesome 
Great price great service can t wait to do more business
Given the wide range of options available for home theater speaker systems  these are a good choice for those how do not want to spend large amounts of cash 
Purchased this 5 years ago  Speakers are still going strong but the SubWoofer stopped working last year and I replaced it with Klipsch 10  Sub  Working great 
Great price on premium sound  Store pick up was fast and easy  Easy to install  Excellent purchase 
These speakers are excellent  Like others have said      good crisp  clean sound  And you can hear the bass  And feel the bass  They won t rattle your fillings out of your mouth  but they are excellent  I just put these in my boat  after installing a JVC Receiver 2 years ago  and I had put some 6X9 Kenwoods in the back  They rock HARD  and they were just blowing the front speakers out of the water  You could barely hear them  They were Schoche 6 1  2 speakers  and they sounded pretty darn good  for the super cheap price  I liked them  But the Kenwoods totally over powered them  Now      problem solved  More of an evened out sound  now that I have some legit speakers up front  I really like these Alpines 
these speakers sound great in my two front doors  very easy to install and the protective screen  grill is strong and protects well
Very happy with the purchase of these speakers  Great sound 
Had these speakers in my surround sound system for 7 years  Last winter a snow and ice backed up water into our home and water poured in through the speakers which were mounted in the ceiling  The old speaker actually still worked but the insurance company wanted us to replace them  I was surprised to find the exact same speaker still being sold  Great sound also very durable 
I bought and upgraded receiver for my living room and moved the old Yamaha receiver upstairs in the game room  These speakers are great and deliver clear sound especially for the price 
You re looking for a separate speaker to round out your sound system this is an excellent choice
I am very satisfied with this high quality speaker  it has fidelity and very good bass  Looking forward to buy another XB 30 and connect both speakers for an amazing stereo sound 
Speaker was easy to install  They sound amazing around my patio and pool  Great buy 
This speaker is well worth the money  Very loud and has good bass  Feels durable and well put together  Also purchased the smaller model for my mother  There is a clear difference between the two  but the smaller model is also high quality and worth the money 
We originally purchased this product to take to the beach for a beach day   We ended up keeping it  The sound comes through very clear  We love it  
I purchased this charger for when my battery is running low on my Samsung Note 4 and I am not close to a plug or my car charger  It does take time to charge but the peace of mind knowing I have it  makes it worth every penny  It charges my phone to about 75% in an hour  I keep it in my purse and it charges as I work or shop etc  It doesn t get hot  It is slim in design and charges better than a Mobie for the same price  Highly recommend 
Headphones are best I have heard and are very comfortable   Quality soft leather ear cups  great highs and good bass make these quality headphones a joy
Excellent sounds and easy for anyone to use age 5 and above
Best headphones with perfect sound  Noise cancellation is not the best 
Great sound and very comfortable  Highly recommend 
Nice portable speaker  Easy to use and great sound 
Overall I have been very satisfied with the qualify and functionality of this Portable speaker  The 3 main areas of satisfaction revolve around how the speaker is charged  the sound quality and the ease of set up This speaker does not require a charging cable  but rather a charging dock  It has a screwable pin on the bottom of the speaker that can be exchanged to adapt with a charging dock  Super easy to unscrew factory screw and replace with docking screw The quality of sounds that pumps out of this speaker is insane  I have use several portable speakers in the past  but this one blows the rest out of the water  Deep base  crisp treble  very clear sounds  Finally  the last item that i loved about this speaker was the set up and app functionality  Once I had the app installed  I was up and running with Alexa functionality within 3 minutes  tops  Very intuitive and easy to use I would highly recommend this speaker 
Build quality is amazing  Sound quality and soundstage  in your favorite songs you will hear the separation between the lead singer and the backup singers  if you are using a DAC  comfortable to wear for 2 3 hours  
Excellent sound  ears get hot sometimes after prolonged use  slightly bulky
Compared to Amazon�s Echo  this speaker offers better sound quality  The midrange is very crisp and clear and makes vocals really stand out  When I listened to some of my Diana Krall playlist  her vocals sounded very intimate like she was singing right in front of me Setup was very easy  you just plug it in and download and install the Ultimate Ears App for your phone  tablet and the app searches for and connects to the speaker after which you can set it up To set up the speaker to connect to your wifi network  the app did require me to type in my wifi password which can be a pain on a phone  tablet if you have a long password  I�ve seen other apps that have the ability to automatically set up the password without the user having to type it in  after all the phone  tablet already knows the password if it is on your wifi network My speakers came with a charging dock that is a must have accessory  It normally costs  39 99  Just sit your speaker on the charging dock and it will start charging  You don�t have to fumble around to flip the rubber tab hiding the usb port to charge the speaker To set up your speaker to use the charging dock  you unscrew the original black plug on the bottom of the speaker and replace it with a shiny metallic plug that makes contact with the charging pins on the dock  I do wonder if the speaker is still as waterproof with the shiny metallic plug since water would be able to touch the charging rings on the plug After you set up the speaker  you can use the standard Alexa app to fine tune the Alexa part of the speaker  One thing I noticed is that you can�t change the wake up word for the MegaBlast to anything else  Amazon  Computer etc    It will only respond to Alexa  Also  some services like Spotify aren�t available yet but that didn�t bother me since I mostly use Amazon Music  So  basically  it seems like the MegaBlast doesn�t currently support all the features of the Amazon Echo  Hopefully  future firmware upgrades will fix this The top of the speaker is slightly concave with a light bar that lights up when it recognizes a voice command  Compared to the Echo and Echo Dot  I found myself having to repeat myself a lot more before the MegaBlast would respond to my voice commands  Because of this  I don�t think it�s microphones are as good as those in the Echo  To make matters worse  it�s sometimes hard to know if it recognizes the wake up word because it can be difficult to see the light at the top of the speaker if the speaker is located at or above eye level I had no problems using it as a bluetooth speaker  Pairing with my phone  tablets was easy and I always had a strong connection with no drop outs In summary  the MegaBlast is a stellar portable bluetooth speaker that offers superior sound quality over most competing bluetooth speakers  As an Alexa smart speaker  it falls a little short of a real Amazon Echo with regards to command recognition and it currently doesn�t support all the features of a real Amazon Echo  Hopefully future firmware upgrades will rectify some of these shortcomings 
Excellent sound quality for the cost  Deep bass and clear treble  Comfortable to wear
Great portable smart speaker that gets very loud and has plenty of bass for its size  Got the extra wireless charge base that keeps it fully charged for when I want to take the speaker outside 
The best BT speaker I have owned to date  Sound quality is excellent covering a vast range from less than 10hz to 20Khz over Bluetooth without any noticeable degradation in sound clarity  The  Extra Bass  button provides deep and loud bass especially useful for hop  R B  rap  electronic and rock music I wasn t able to test the add speaker function because I only have one SRS HG1 speaker unit  Battery life is exceptional and compared to other BT speakers I have owned these last about twice as long in real life situations at nearly 8 hours with volume maxed out and  Extra Bass  enabled 
Purchased for a gift to mi madre  Used for a nice sized party and the sound quality was great even at high volume music stayed crisp and clear
Headphone experience is higly dependent on personal sound preferences   these fit mine like a glove  Easy to listen to a range of music for 2 or more hours without tiring of the sound or discomfort I compared these to Sennheiser Momentum  Denon AH D600  B W P3   P5  AKG ?  andBose QC 25  The music ranged from The Who  Herbert Mann  John Coltrane  9 Inch Nails  Herbert Hancock  Traffic  Supertramp  a Bach concierto  and Nora Jones  These won every round for best performance at combined bass  midrange  treble performance  and piano  female  male vocals  sax  acoustic and electric guitar  bass guitar  and full percussion  Easy to discern all instruments in the Bach concierto   just phenomenal  All music in FLAC files  My at home and travel experience after 4 weeks remains excellent Build quality and design are superb  These are definitely worth a trial against any favorites you may have  These are very efficient  approx 25 ohms  and equally perfect for DAP  mobile devices  HD music file formats  and home systems 
I can hear sounds and quality like never before  Great upgrade from the factory speakers 
I am so glad that I purchased this for my fianc  I did a ton of research on different headphones and I am glad I spent the extra money on the noise cancellation  Super clear sound and they are not as heavy as they look so it s comfortable on your ears 
I am so glad that I purchased this for my fianc�  I did a ton of research on different headphones and I am glad I spent the extra money on the noise cancellation  Super clear sound and they are not as heavy as they look so it s comfortable on your ears 
This is the second one I bought and now I can pair them together  I have them on my kitchen TV and it vastly improves the sound  I also pair them to my smart phone and the result is outstanding 
this unit has excellent sound and surprisingly good volume for its size    a good value   
Xb 30 sounds great and was very easy to use  Battery life very is very good 
Great sound  easy set up  beware if you are using windows 7  There are driver issues 
Great purchases and a great prices for great sound
My husband bought me a HD8 and the speakers are on the bottom of Fire and I couldn t hardly hear it  With this speaker I actually have to turn the volume down when playing music it is so awesome
These speakers sound much better than factory and fairly simple to install 
This is easy to pair and especially when placing on a tile floor provides whole room sound with amazing bass 
Water resistant and excellent sound for the price  especially when bought on sale  Bought for a college student  and it provides excellent sound  and the alternating colors on the speakers provide a festive touch to the dorm room 
XB30 has excellent sound  able to control front lights through free app with pre programmed settings or turn lights off  But again sound quality is why your considering this model  Was my top pick after multiple in store demos of all brands  models  Great battery life  quick to charge unit  Not tried device  phone  charging from XB30  No regrets on this purchase 
Great Sony LBT GPX555 High Power Home Audio System with Bluetooth 
Ram is Beastly I have I 5 6600k and with these anything possible 
All around good choice   size of screen and sound good 
I upgraded from a Harmony 650  which my family found to be too confusing  I was constantly hearing The TV is broken again   The Ultimate One simplifies just about everything  Setup for 5 devices  Samsung TV  Vizio Soundbar  Magnavox DVD  Roku Sony VCR  was a breeze  The software automatically copied settings from the 650  and adding TV channels via location lookup was very cool Once it was setup  which took no more than 10 minutes  it worked amazingly well  The turn on procedures for activities go much quicker than the 650  and the signal actually seems to get to the devices now  where as it was hit or miss with the 650    the primary reason for the TV being broken    Touch screen is quite responsive  Not as responsive as a smartphone  but close Upgraded to the latest firmware  Some things about it are nice  such as information about what it s actually doing during a startup sequence  However  I m not a fan of the new look of the menus  All caps for the text is annoying  Wish there was a way to change font size  style Negative reviews regarding button layout are somewhat valid  but not worth removing a star  I found that its easy to get used to where they are in a short time of use  Most usual functions can be done with the buttons while watching TV or video  and there are 4 programmable generic buttons on the bottom as well   so it is rare that you would need to look down to hunt for something on the screen I am impressed  and I think my family will be much happier with the simplified layout and better automation 
Love this one  Highly recommend for everyone to have one of these 
Simplified our home theater system control  and works flawlessly  Especially convenient for a spouse who may not be very tech savvy  Wife loves it 
Very simple to program and use  Vastly superior to less expensive models  Worth every penny 
By and large this is an excellent device  The only significant issues that I have are that I needed the remote and hub separated by a floor in the house  I m just about at the maximum range and can have some difficulties in reaching the hub with the remote  They should consider Wi Fi as a communications implementation  Logitech also appears to have quality control problems with its firmware upgrades  I ve encountered a nuisance bug with the last one  Also  the current rule is one remote  one hub  I have two home theater set ups and this was a source of confusion  I had to ask tech support the right question to get things sorted out  But the discussion with tech support indicated that other customers experienced the similar frustration  But don t let all of this dissuade you from considering this unit  It requires very little programming skill  The set up software is really good  well thought out  What I most appreciate is that I can make make changes to my home theater configurations without having to call a dealer to reprogram my  previous  universal remote controls 
BLUF  Great remote and would buy againThis is a replacement for a Harmony 700  discontinued  that was beginning to fail and this was a great upgrade For background  I have been using and programming various remotes for years going back to older Philips Pronto remotes  This is a very intuitive and powerful platform in a reasonably priced package  Coming from another Harmony remote  the initial setup was very simple with a few tweaks for preference and new capability  I say that acknowledging I am something of a geek and understand the basics of how remotes work and their limitations  Even for the technologically challenged  Logitech has done a good job of making the programming interface intuitive and easy to use but still powerful enough for advanced users to customize  If anything  it errors on the side of simplicity vice functionality Some of the biggest concerns I had was the fast forward  skip button since the two functions have been combined into a single button with this remote  I was quite leery of this as a DirecTV customer but happy to report that with a bit of tweaking and use of the gestures this is completely a non issue  Only shortfall I can complain about is the lack of immediate access to the number pad  you can swipe left  right to it but I would prefer to map a soft key to bring it up  Niggling issue that may be possible but I haven t found an easy way to do it just yet The biggest complaint and the area where Logitech misses the mark is  as others have pointed out  with the basic ergonomics  The hard buttons are great  the touch screen is great and the overall size of the remote is great  they just need to re organize  Put the touchscreen at the very top and move the transport controls  FF  pause  record  play etc   under the screen  It would even benefit from being slightly longer to allow the main controls to sit just above center  where your thumb naturally sits  and fit better in the hand  I complain about this  pointing out this is a great unit that could benefit from a refresh  same functionality in a slightly different package To wrap this up  I am VERY pleased with this remote overall  It is not perfect and could use a change to the basic layout BUT it is a SOLID unit that is very flexible and a pleasure to use  If you are considering this a a first universal remote or an upgrade to an existing one  it is well worth it 
This is my second Harmony remote since I dropped my last remote and damage the display screen  remote still worked   I had the previous model and was still able to update this new remote after installing the new software  All I had to do was to log in with the new software and it retrieved all of the hardware and configurations that were on my old remote  I bought a new tv so I edited the hardware changes and made it very easy to move over to the new remote  Now everything can be turned on and off with the push of 1 button  It seems that all of the popular features are easily found now compared to the last remote 
i had gotten the remote for my parents who are in their seventies  they liked the fact that we programmed all their favorite channels into the remote and all they had to do was look for the tv symbol
I have successfully removed 6 remote controllers from my entertainment system with this one device  Even though I must turn on 3 seperate devices just to watch tv  this remote can learn to perform everything that is needed with a swipe of the finger  You may still need your originals from time to time  but this fantastic remote takes control of all your devices  no matter who made it  or when  I highly recommend it to anyone with more than one remote to deal with One important note  If you have your devices spread around the room  or within a cabinet  you will probably want to spring for the hub  which allows you to control items that the remote isn t pointed at  Awesome unit 
I am a long time user of Logitech remotes  I purchased this to replace my previous one  Unfortunately  this did not provide RF capability and so I upgraded it to a Harmony Elite which I believe is a better remote for the money 
I had an earlier model and upgraded to this model due to a USB issue on the prior model  I found this very easy to set up  I had all new equipment so had to change the online configuration but once you ve done it with prior models it is very easy to use the new version of the software  The addition of favorite channels is a nice addition  The remote feels good in the hand  it is intuitive to use and works as advertised  When my other remote went out my wife was frustrated because we had to use several remotes to operate all the equipment  Other universal remotes are more difficult to set up and use  My wife loves the watch TV Watch a movie    buttons  The fact that it remembers what was on and turns off unnecessary equipment is great  Love the Harmony line of remotes 
Easy to setup  Much easier than the remote I ve replaced with the Ultimate Onej
excellent remote
I owned a harmony one years ago and always had issues with programs and powering on due to the ir being not the best  This remote is 100x better  Works great  powers on everything  easy to use menu and very easy to set up programs  No problems with any IR signal missing or not inputting a command 
Logitech Harmony remote controls always deliver   This is the 4th one that I ve purchased  2 for me and 2 for relatives  It s a great device which is hassle free for older people since there s no chance it will ever get de programmed and a great device for me to control all my home theater devices  My old 880 still works and have been using it for 10 years  Great product from a great company
Works great does everything I want it too and more 
The JVC KD X320BTS single DIN head unit is a very good radio for the price  It s loud  somewhat simple  and looks and feels great in any car 
Its a very good unit and works exactly as you would expect a  500 piece of equipment to work  The mic is excellent during phone calls and while  telling  the unit what to do  The available apps like messages is perfect and easy to use  the maps display is great  The biggest drawback is its price followed by the fact that its not wireless than the limited apps that can be displayed  In addition I too like several other buyers agree that the volume control is entirely too sensitive  Overall happy but still questioning whether it was worth the price 
This is an excellent radio  This radio met all my expectations  Very easy to customize  very good sound quality 
Very good audio quality Functions very well with Chromecast and Bluetooth Was able create multi room group with this and Chromecast audio dongle connected to receiver 
Sounds great  rich mids crisp highs  and a good bass  We have a set in our TV room kitchen and common area  They sound great when playing all types of music and movies
Exceptional sound and quality at a great price
If you have a type cover for your surface pro 4 don t expect this one to do anything different  The only thing different about this cover is the Aesthetics and the material it is made out of  That is also why it is a bit more in price over the original type cover for the SP4  The grey is beautiful match to the color of the SP4 and when working in a professional environment like myself  it gives your surface a more elegant look and touch of class  I purchased a turquoise type cover back when the SP4 launched last October and I was fully aware that I was not getting anything additional by purchasing this one  For the people who gave the device a poor review  doesn t address the actual product itself  The product does it s job  it does it well  If you have the type cover for the SP4 already then you most likely do not need to upgrade to this one as I didn t need to  I WANTED to because of the material and the look of the two pieces combined 
Easy to install  great sound overall  If you just have factory speakers  you ll notice a decent step up  I recommend an amp to really make the most of the speakers 
We purchased this as a gift while we were in Best Buy for another reason  The bluetooth speaker was easy to install and gave great sound quality  I m now thinking of buying one for myself 
This is a great wall mount for the large 70  Sharp TV that has ports on the back  center of the TV  It s very sturdy and secure 
I dont come that often to bestbuy because there is not alot can buy for my home  The times that i have come to bestbuy it has al been an enjoyabl pleasure to shop and buy things from your store  I will be coming back in the future to buy a smart tv  
I bought this to replace an old harmony remote that finally died after many years  I was reluctant to buy it because I didn t know how such a small remote could do everything my old one did  IT DOES  And it has more features and it is easier to use and program  One really nice feature is that after entering your zip code and cable provider  the software automatically puts keys for all of your channels  Nice because I often forget channel numbers and now I don t have to search the guide 
Works very well  workss as expected  Setup a bit tricky 
Excellent product  I am not tech savvy at all and this is so easy to use  I LOVE IT   
I use these with my desktop computer to keep from disturbing my wife while I watch videos or listen to music  I love not having any wires to get tangled or tie me down  They are much better than RF  FM headphones I ve tried in the past  Range is great  I can walk around my entire house without loosing the signal  User manual is very brief but they were easy to setup so that wasn t a big problem  Very comfortable and the red color makes them easy to find on my messy desk  Microphone picks up well when chatting online  Controls are simple to use  Battery life seems to be good  I wear them several hours a day and plug them in to recharge while I sleep  I m rather tone deaf  so I can t comment on their audio quality except that they sound fine to me  I really can t say anything bad about them  they re great 
Perfect solution for watching my own TV service in another location  Excellent picture quality as long as your upload broadband speed is higher than 3gb per second  Highly recommended product 
Purchased a Samsung based on recommendation from friends who recently purchased 2 new ones  Actually  we went up 1 step in size than planned  Color  clarity  size  everything is perfect and it fits in a small area where we had our previous TV  Total satisfaction 
Enjoy this Bluetooth connected device  Good range 
Very satisfied customer with Sirius xm radio would recommend to a friend
Has worked great in large living room  Good reach  Display can be a bit slow but would recommend
a nice backpack for my dslr camera  nikon d800  and couple of lenses 85mm and 35mm best to carry everywhere 
Excellent product  set it up at a remote location and get great video at the other end 
Excellent product  Excellent HD recording   playback 
Excellent product  Hold tv perfectly  Only complaint is that it was more expensive than At Costco  which was sold out  
I bought two of these for my Drobo almost a year and a half ago  I have had no issues  They were easy to pop into my Drobo  have served me very well  Having two of them allows me to worry less in case one fails  but both have worked splendidly so far  I am back on this page to possibly order two more to fill my Drobo 
I travel outside of the country and was frustrated for a number of years for not being able to access college football and other programming  However  the slingbox has solved this problem  I can turn on the slingbox and my cablebox any time I want and watch my USA cable  for which I am already paying Also  when using my iphone to watch TV  I noticed that the slingbox automatically disconnects itself if you did not disconnect it  maybe it is only my cablebox   so if you are connecting back with your phone after a day or two  it will seem like you do not have signal  but just press  power  on the system and the cablebox will go back on  and you can watch TV again  To avoid that when I am done watching TV in my phone  I now turn off the cablebox first and then disconnect from slingbox  and when I want to watch again  just connect and press  power   However  the software in computers makes it even easier  I just press watch TV and it takes care of everything  In conclusion  it is easy but you just have to figure out the details Be aware that the signal quality and speed will depend on the internet at both ends 
I m very happy with this product  Can t complain about this 
Let me tell you that for a small room is great Sound is creepy and well center It is not the louder and the best but for the money it a still Base is decent it does the work but do not put it to the max just put it to the 80 and you will love   also depends how powerful is you receiver  
Product provides access to my tv while I am traveling  Traveling outside the US and aim still able to watch my programs  The quality of the viewing is limited by the quality of thewifi that is being used 
Product works great  Easy to install  I purchased this to double the memory in my Macbook Pro  Couldn t be simpler 
Synced right up to my equipment  Works Great  Has trouble connecting every now and then but with the fix it now button it fixes the issue right away 
The MIRCOSOFT Surface Pro 4 keyboard w  Fingerprint technology works well with no issues 
This is a great product for folks with legacy laptops and desktops that are not equipped to operate wirelessly on a 5 0ghz level  Because it is true a plug and play device  in mere minutes I went from 20 mbps to over 200 mbps  This device is well worth money 
This memory card is for my Sony Alpha  digital SLR and is speedy  and extremely capacious
We recently moved to FL from NY and our new neighbors suggested we invest in a weather alert radio  We are so happy that we took their advice  In just one month it has already given us two local tornado warnings and numerous severe thunderstorm alerts  We sleep soundly knowing that if severe weather comes during the night we will be awakened in time to take cover if necessary  Wouldn t be without this product 
Preformed as expected  And at a wonderful price  My dell drive died  needed a new one quick  Best Buy had best price and fastest turn around 
This speaker is what I was looking for  I have a great sound system in my family room but needed a speaker to listen to outside or in other rooms in the house  This speaker is more than adequate  It was easy to pair with my devices and it has a good quality sound  Don t use the extra bass   not into lots of bass 
Excellent Portable Bluetooth Speaker  I use this mainly for it s WIFI capabilites and not the Bluetooth as I can set this up as a  GoogleCast  speaker within my group of Googlecast based speakers in my house  Excellent Sound  quality and volume   
Excellent picture  blackest blacks  OS seems stable and intuitive  apps look and feel great  Typical Samsung quality  would recommend 
Mounted in kitchen and has an amazing picture quality  Perfect size for the space
Smart tv that meet all my technical needs with the ability to take full advantage of advances 
We ve had the tv for one day  so learning continues  The picture looks terrific  the controls are easy to use  and each attribute offers multiple features 
I purchased the XPS 8920 when it was on sale  and it is an excellent value for the price I paid  about  800   It replaces a similar desktop  XPS 8700  4th Gen Core i7  and has noticeably improved performance  largely because the 7th Gen Core i7 overclocks dynamically as needed  I was watching TM s performance stats and could see the CPU clock at 4 1 or 4 2  When the load diminishes  the CPU clocks down to 1 8 to 2 2  An efficient use of power The build is solid and the computer performs well  My only cautions are two   1  The 8920 motherboard limits the number of SATA drives to 4  CD  DVD plus 3 hard drives  and that is one less than I was able to install in the 8700  CD  DVD plus 4 hard drives    2  The 8920 interior is significantly more cramped that the 8700  I was able to install two SSD drives without difficulty  but the case is not  well  roomy and is a little harder to work inside than the 8700  which was a breeze All in all  though  the XPS 8920 was a solid investment  I d buy it again and recommend it to others 
After finding out that we were eligible for an upgrade we took home the Verizon 4g lte jet pack  it s working better than we expected  Another great recommendation from Best Buy  You guys  especially Chad  are always on the mark with recommendations
Love that best buy had exactly what I needed in stock  Performance is reliable  too
I needed a replacement desktop for my software business use  After hours of research  both on line and in store  I settled on this Dell as the best value for my time and money and walked out of the store with it in hand  Powerful and ease to set up out of the box  I also found that it was well designed for extensibility   I added an on board SSD  another HDD  and a few other items with no problems at all  Flawless performance and flexibilty at a great price 
Great addition to my church speaker system  May one day use a pair in my patio system
Easy to install and provide excellent sound from a medium sized outdoor speaker on my above ground garage deck 
The Slingbox M2 is a great streaming player  It allows me to watch live tv on the go through my phone  laptop  or roku box when away  The picture quality is pretty clear Cons  The item can only connect to the set top box with a component HD cord  which is included   You have to pay extra and get the Slingbox 500 if you want to connect with an HD cord and get those options such as the full tv guide The tv guide w   the component HD wires only goes up to channel 100  you can get the channels above 100  but have to enter it manually 
Got this radio to replace the factory one    if you have an iPhone then this is the best radio for you  I have an hour commute every day and i am loving this radio  great buy 
Much better than the Surface Pro 3 keyboard  Well worth upgrading 
I have a Surface Pro 3 and my original keyboard was damaged and finding a replacement outside of the Microsoft Store  online  as the brick   mortar stores were out too  was excruciating  I inquired at the Best Buy store and the salesman let me know that this keyboard would fit and work with my SP3 and it does  FLAWLESSLY  I love the fingerprint reader for Windows Hello   and typing on this keyboard is wonderful  I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard to any SP3 or SP4 user 
I really like the key spacing and the fingerprint reader works great   
Excellent keyboard                                 
This keyboard lives up to its promises  The keys are large and easy to use  I have used fingerprint reader locks before with poor results  but this one works extremely well  No complaints 
My target was an over the ear headphone with noise cancelling   wireless  Bluetooth capability for around  300  Choices were quickly pared down to the JBL Everest Elite 700  Beats Studio Wireless  and the Sony MDRZX770   I would have liked an option from Bose  but apparently they don t make a wireless headset with noise cancelling  it s either or   For me  the Beats are well built and ergonomically acceptable  but the sound is simply too colored  The Sony was a slightly cheaper option  sounded ok  not great   but I wasn t thrilled with the build quality  For me  The JBL was the clear winner  Great and relatively neutral sound  very comfortable and ergonomically designed  The JBL Elite 700 paired up with my Samsung UHDTV and HTC One phone without a glitch  and with no lip sync issues  The JBL software for Android  while not necessary for operation  worked as advertised and provided for a few nice additional features such as preset and  or customizable EQ  The defeatable noise cancellation was very effective  though not quite as good as Bose provides   and the adjustable and defeatable  Awareness  control  which allows you to let varying amounts of sound  phone  doorbell  car horn  through is a really nice feature  And yes  the headset can be used  wired  also  should you wish to conserve battery time  All in  this is a very well thought out headset and I couldn t be happier with my purchase  The only improvement I can think of would be a hard shell carrying case  The supplied case is ok  but soft  and might not be sufficient protection in certain environments  Anyway  Highly recommended 
Have owned Logitech Remotes for a number of years  My old one crashed so I purchased this product  I love how it responds  how easy the touch screen is  all channels right in front of me  easy to program  Glad my old one crashed 
As advertised  Battery life is great  Small and compact  We use in our RV and works great 
These are far the best sounding JBL headphones I have purchased  I have the Beats  too  but am enjoying these headphones better  The sound is great with its  noise cancelling option  Fit over my ears perfectly and love the white ones  Well worth the money  Thanks  JBL 
These Bluetooth headphones come with a 35mm cable  so you can also connect them to your non Bluetooth PC at work   so you re not limited to just Bluetooth devices  The sound is better than Sony s MDRZX330BT and less expensive  MEElectronics  Runaway gives you 15 hour playtime VS Sony s 30 hour playtime  still not bad  considering that Runaways are smaller in size  I like the control buttons on this Runaway headphones  they are more tactile as well as intuitive  placed on the side  one above the other  I had these before until they physically broke  so I know what I m getting   great quality 
At Best Buy store  tried B   W P 3 over the ear phones  then the P7s  Around the ear phones  Much clearer sound and deeper bass and extended treble with P7  as well as much better sound isolation 
The sound clarity of these are phenomenal  Bass reproduction could be a little better but is not distorted  Overall very happy with the purchase 
These are amazing  You can set the level of residual noise you hear  I don t hear anything other than what I m trying to listen to  I bought them so I can watch loud movies while my family sleeps  My Wife is just as happy as I am with them 
These phones are outstanding  Hearing old songs and sounds I never noticed before  Great for watching movies on iPad 
Excellent headphone  I use them for my home audio system for vinyl records  The sound is very good  they are fit very nice over the ear Will try them on my I pod 
This was a realistic alternative to  180 headphones my 10 year old son wanted  The quality and durability are excellent  I would buy them again 
The 40� tv is the perfect size and the picture is crystal clear  You can�t beat the price either
Easy to install and works great on the computer for making it wireless 
Great concept and pretty reliable technology  When ready to change the channel  sometimes my iPhone does not show that i am currently watching  so it has to turn off and back on  which can get annoying  Overall  I would recommend the Slingbox 
Just Opened My System Very Satisfied With it Small And Very Powerful  Simple Hook Up Clear Crispy Sound And The Sub Is So Powerful With That Ground Shaking Bass  I m Very Impressed Seriouly  I Recommend My Brother He s Ordering 1 Tomorrow 
Great picture  Easy to set up  I still have to align with my Direct TV remote 
Bought this to replace a toshiba 40  that went out  Very pleased with the picture  Don t use it for internet or anything but am enjoying the crispness of the picture 
The equipment perfectly works with my tablet  I recommend this product to all buyers of Microsoft Surface 
I am an amateur when it comes to audiology  The speakers meet minimum requirement for my Yamaha sound system  Speakers sound really good 
This is the 2nd Harmony remote i have purchased  it was very easy to set up   Configure  has all of the features you need in a cost effective version of a Universal remote  No hassles  no confusion 
I recently increased the capacity of our RAID 5 NAS system and installed the WD Red drives  They are much faster than the old drives and have worked flawlessly since the upgrade  It s helpful to have the choice of a drive designed for this purpose in the WD Red product line 
I would recommend this to anyone who is needing wireless head phones for personal type of applications  Nice volume  nice look and feel  Great all around 
Love it  Speed is very good  Price is fair and it does the job 
Excellent device to carry along for the time when you just need that extrasolar for your phone
So far it s a great desktop  this is my 2nd Dell last one lasted 7 years 
I use this with my Nighthawk router and the coverage is excellent  5 bars by the pool 100  away  Highly recommend 
Works on all my devices  CONTROLS EVERYTHING ON TIME AND PERFECT   Works dvr cable surround sound blu ray and more 
solid  this is my 5th one  i don t use any thing else  bought 2 open box before  excellent condition  save money that way 
Perfect computer for what I needed it for  Using it for our business 
This computer is extremely quick and has great storage and memory  We use this in the construction industry and needed something with space for bidding programs  It works wonderfully 
This computer is the best conputer i have had yet  Connecting bluetooth keyboard  mouse  speakers and printer was a piece of cake  it even comnected to daughters headphones in the other room with a push of the button  Top of the line all the way
I love this fiture for security reasonsMicrosoft   Surface Pro Type Cover with Fingerprint ID have had no problems using it 
Gave this to my son as a birthday gift  he is very particular and intentional when it comes to purchasing and owning quality merchandise of any kind  He loves it  
I ve been using these tapes for over 5 yrs and they are great for my Sony MiniDV  I bought about 10 tapes 5 yrs ago and I reuse them  I ve used earch tape atleast twice and I do not see any degradation in the picture quality 
Glad I spent more for SAMSUNG  My research paid off
Love Samsung  Clear sharp picture  Excellent sound
This was not the speaker I intended to purchase   extremely glad I did  The sound is excellent along with adding extra base if desired  The lights are a bonus  The speaker is light weight but solid as well as water resistant  Extremely happy with my Sony 
This is the best camera backpack I have ever purchased    very comfortable to wear  lightweight  and    best of all    the main compartment only opens from the backside  No need to worry about anybody reaching in when you re commuting with a crowd 
I installed these into a Mac Mini   made in NOTICEABLY faster  but that was because I installed 4Xs the original amount of RAM   Very challenging to replace RAM on a Mac Mini but doable 
Nice speakers   clear voice   easy to connect on bluetooth  
As far as bluetooth speakers go  this one has amazing sound clarity  volume  and battery life  It charges quickly and pairs well and fast  staying connected with a minimum of issues  The extra bass mode is fantastic and certainly carries the oomph of a much larger speaker My only complaint is that this speaker is best for party mode  It features an LED ring around the primary facing and two strobes  These lights seemly cannot be turned off  there is no physical button to do so  except through an app you must run on your smartphone  The SongPal app is rated 2 stars on the App Store at the moment  and once you open it  it s clear why  The app can t connect to the speaker  a setup protocol is required  and it doesn t seem to recognize that you re already connected to the speaker in Bluetooth mode  It s not clear if you can shut off the  party mode  lights or not as I was never able to get it to connect after several attempts I haven t tried splashing the speaker with water  although it s clear from the housing near the charging port that the product is water resistant  Sturdy and built well  but not prohibitively heavy   it s the right size to join you at the pool or at the office  provided your coworkers like to party if you can t get the SongPal app to work  Ultimately  this is a really  really nice bluetooth speaker   and if you just leave it as is  it s pretty darn cool  But if you had to put it in a business setting where LED lighting effects and strobes aren t going to fly  you might want to test out the SongPal app in store before you go much further 
First  the sound quality is excellent  all the way up to full volume  always the first measure of a speaker  It can be made quite loud  sufficient for a room full of people or a patio party  The sound is quite pleasing with or without the  Extra Bass  function  which increases the bass  but not to the point of thumping over the music I was able to easily pair and use the speaker with my phone  tv  and Amazon Echo Dot  which really increased the utility  No more recharging after an hour or two either  the battery is spec ed at 24hrs life with a 4 hr recharge and I believe it  I had it on all day without recharging  When I finally recharged it  it was done in a couple of hours  The charging port for a phone or other device is a bonus  The outside is rubberized and claims IPX5 water resistance  which is nice on the patio  especially this winter  There are  Party Lights   which are not too obtrusive and can be turned off at the speaker The Sony SongPal app lets you do everything the speaker buttons do and more  It has a basic equalizer  allows more control over the lights  and can  sync  multiple speakers  so you can slave multiple speakers to one phone and spread them around the house or whatever  I didn t try this feature  since it would require multiple speakers Negatives are relatively minor  There is no carrying case  The app is fairly hefty  44M on Android   but not really necessary  The lights don t appear to sync to the music except for a couple of white LED strobes on either end of the speakers 
Excellent battery time and good Sound  my only concern is the ear pad or ear cushion that seems to be a short life material  I haven t found a place to buy a replacement since imitation leather always tend to crack or peel off 
I love this bag  slotting us perfect and the price is even better 
It took me awhile to finally buy a bag  I love it 
I went back and forth between these and a set of Bose but ultimately chose these because of the sculpted ear muffs  Audio quality seemed to be negligable between the two so it came down to which felt better for me  Highly recommend you try on any high end head phones in store priot to purchase 
I was looking for a Wi Fi USB adapter that is capable of transmitting at 1300 Mbps  I found this one  It matched very well with the AC1900 routers we have  The set up is easy by running Netgear Genie and insert the adapter in a USB port  Total time spend  about 8 10 minutes from unpacking and fully operational  In fact  we purchased four more after our initial testing 
This amp is small and can be installed behind the radio  It has sufficient drive for some boom boom boom without being a nuisance to everyone else 
These headphones are an excellent alternative to the Bose equivalent  at a fraction of the cost  They are comfortable and truly noise cancelling  Great purchase 
Audio is crisp and clean  They sound great in my suburban 
I have been a fan of Logitech Harmony remotes for a while  Our old  One  was starting to fail after several years so I looked into a new one  This is much more compact  the touch screen is easy  and even the set up is easier online  The only  negative  is that it needs to have the battery recharged pretty often even though it s not really doing anything  Easy enough if you always keep it in the charging cradle  which is also pretty slick   Thus the 4 instead of 5 stars Highly recommend   
Works great  Improved ergonomics over original SurfacePro3 keyboard  Fingerprint recognition is reliable and efficient 
The keyboard was well built  The fingerprint reader works fine  It turns the Surface Pro 4 into a well built laptop like machine 
A perfect accessory for this tablet  A must have for the road warrior 
bought this camera bag to see how well it would handle all my stuff nikon d3000 with 3 lenses  2 flash   And it s performing as expected  Cushioned shoulder straps lessen wear and tear  and cables to make the bag more secure and easier to retrieve stuff  I approve 
This keyboard cover is awesome  Types like a normal keyboard  easy to attach and detach when desired  Fingerprint reader is very quick 
Better than expected  Highly recommend this computer   
Bought these for a trip on an airplane  They were perfect no interference
Easy setup and works like a charm  Highly recommend 
Easy to set up and program  would recommend this product
excellent product that is highly recommended to all 
Excellent quality  this headphones sound amazing and the noise cancelling is pretty good  the fit is pretty comfortable 
Excellent size and quality from samsung  The built in plug works well
excellent speakers with high quality sound and efficiency ideal for all types of playground
Good  More than I needed  Exceeded my expectations 
Great product we love this product and it works perfectly
Great sound quality and bass  Sony never disappoints 
How much can you say about memory? It arrived in 2 days  It fit  Package was hard to open  Computer detected the memory and everything went seamlessly 
I feel the router is very help  After purchasing a rather large house I need to buy a bigger wireless router to reach my basement and bedroom  I did some research before hand and felt this would be my best option 
I had two pair of these installed in my 04  Dodge Dakota 4 door pickup  I had the Geek Squad install them and am very satisified all around  I m still using the factory deck and am very impressed  The mids and highs are great and the base is good for a 6 5  speaker running on a factory deck 
I love how it connects to my iPhone  Reads my messages and allows me to respond with my voice  Only downfall is no bluetooth compatibility  but at least it charges my iPhone while connected 
I Love it and have a good deal on the price for a smart Tv
I love this adapter it has boosted my signal ten fold in my home and strongly recommend it for anyone that needs an adapter  You will however have to download the drivers from the website to an external usb first for 100% installation 
I purchased this portable charger for a vacation I was taking because my phone uses a lot of battery  I was impressed with the speed it charged at and the sleek design made it fit comfortably in my pocket 
it works great my iMac is now super fast and I can work as if it were new
Love it
Love it  This is 3rd harmony remote we ve purchased  the only brand I ll buy 
Love Samsung products they are the best for my phone
Love this product  Works great and has a great sound
Portable and powerful  Charges quickly and battery lasts for a long time 
This is a great stereo but it does go on sale in the none summer months so I would purchase then 
This is my second Sony Bluetooth speaker  This one was purchased as a gift  My niece used and loved mine so much  I bought her one for her college dorm  These are sturdy and produce good sound 
This new keyboard is just about perfect I really like the fingerprint reader as a back up 
This weather radio is easy to set up and does what it says it s only notified me when there were floods and winds close to my area during Harvey  The downside is this product is not available in store  must be ordered online
very easy to operate and fancy too  my little computer
Very logical instructions And set up was very easy  No complications at all  I programmed a tv  Xbox  tuner and did player in 10 minutes 
We bought 2 Petcam s before this one  Returned the other two  one purchased at pet store  This one was so easy to set up and maintain  You can unplug and move it and you couldn t do that with petstore one without setting it up again  When any questions arose there s an 800 number for wonderful help  Recommend this one highly    ps after purchasing it reviews were read and this was reviewed horribly on one site  One person said great things and didn t understand the horrible reviews either  Perhaps the site was owned by a competitive company to make their competitor look bad  Thumbs up for this one    
Well worth the price  I use it all the time with my mobile devices and to sling to another TV in the bedroom without monthly charges for another cable box 
When I m not home  I can watch all of my TV programmkng on the road Recommended 
Works great once everything is setup using the software  Better than having three remotes 
This speaker has got to be the best of all the priors I ve owned 
I purchase this remote as a upgrade to Logitech Harmony 650 because of the need to change battery  Remote was very easy setting up utilizing downloaded software  The touch screen is very responsive in changing channels The help button works great If the remote fail to run its activity correctly  The menu system take a bit getting use to but once learn you will really see the outstanding function of this remote  Highly recommend purchasing this remote
This wall hanger was big enough to mount the 55 and 50 inch televisions we purchased  The range of motion once the TV was mounted is AWESOME   
excellent quality and sound and very easy to install 
Sound is good  Excellent compatibility  Very pleased with product
This speaker is amazing  The sound quality is incredible  and the price is even better 
yamaha 5 1 speaker sistema sound is very good  all in te box  I buy a little more wire 
I have play with it and ja great product is excelent and very verstil  and aditional with sony bravia is the perfect play
I have play with it and ja great product is excelent and very vers�til  and aditional with sony bravia is the perfect play
My husband love it it was a gift and perfect good product
Comfortable  A charge lasts significantly longer than I expected  Selectable levels of noise cancellation is a useful feature for times when i just can t block everything 
The sound has blown me away for the price I paid  You can t go wrong with these speakers for a home theater set up  I have a 600W Yahama receiver and a 65in plasma and the sound is great watching action movies  My son even said he heard the sound out on the driveway when coming thru the garage and into the den where the system is located 
good cube and center channel sound  very powerful and clear subwoofer
Just bought my 2013 Ford F 150 Platinum  Was underwhelmed with the audio quality of the Sony system  As I did my research  I realized that you could buy new Ford replacement speakers for about  8 a piece  That told me all I needed to know that replacing with something else would make a difference  I paid  120 per pair and replaced the fronts and the rears  the installation went pretty smoothly   a little tricky  but not bad at all  thanks YouTube   I had no idea that replacing would make THAT much difference  Completely night and day difference  Let s face it  speakers are pretty inexpensive  I can t say enough great things about these JBL speakers  They are crisp  warm  and totally rock  I very highly recommend these GX892s If you have stock speakers in your vehicle   change them out 
Sounds great  sync  controls are easy to use  Battery life is reasonable between charges 
The harmony One is amazing  My cable box is situated in a spot where the OEM ATT remote would frequently miss a command  however the Harmony One has only missed once in 2 months  I am impressed with the wide angle that the remote works at  For anyone using older happy remotes  I have only had to use the  fix it  feature twice  And it actually fixed the problem Highly recommend 
Excellent base and high end  Blue tooth range is short and it cuts out a little when you adjust the headset 
I spent a great deal of time searching for a good sounding outdoor speaker  I tried the Yamaha NS AW390BL and they had no bass to speak of and the sound quality wasn t much better  I listened to the Klipsch AW 650 and they sounded good  I wasn t able to listen to the Def Tech s before purchasing so knowing my experience with Def Tech quality and reading tons of good reviews  I took a chance and ordered  This speaker has amazing sound quality and bass  even outdoors  I have these connected to a Sonos Connect amp  Since the speakers are 8 ohms they re only receiving 55 watts each  Even still these speakers are loud and are a audiophiles dream come true for outdoors  These speakers are a larger speaker  but still tucked neatly under my soffits  Sure these are a little more expensive than the others  but they are well worth the money  If you just want something to make some noise out side  don t waste the extra money on the Def Tech s  However  if you re an audiophile that enjoys a well balanced great sounding speaker  then AW6500 s are what you want 
In Texas you never know when a storm is just a storm or something more  This weather radio is just what we needed  Now we don t worry  we know 
got these speakers on sale and they were definitely worth every penny 
I was very impressed with the knowledge of the salesperson  She helped us every step of the way 
This radio was easy to install and operate  It has all of the features that I was looking for  Sounds great with my stock speakers  Bluetooth is easy to set up with my phone and music 
My experience with this remote has been nothing but a joyous one  The setup on their website was not only easy  but actually fun for me  It was a four step process  add components  add activities  add your favorite channels  and one more I m forgetting   Setting up my favorite channels took me the longest  but I m super organized  so I was moving channels around and going through all of my channels The customization possibilities with this remote seems endless  When there were buttons that were either missing or didn t do what I wanted  it was super easy to either add a whole new button  functionality  by simply pointing my old remote at my Harmony and teaching my Harmony the new button  or edit a current button You can edit graphics as well  such as the background or your favorite channel icons  I also created a Sequence  basically a macro   which worked perfectly fine   my sequence was watch in 3D which  while in my Watch a Movie activity  had about 4 steps of using my TV s 3D function  I even added a delay of 3 seconds before a couple actions  such as waiting for a screen to fully display before the Exit action was selected  Customizing this remote does require SOME technical skills  but that s expected with this remote  I think  It is pricey  but for what it does and how it s already programmed for each of my components  I think I got my money s worth If I had to nitpick  it s not as easy as it should be to connect the sync cable to the remote  And also  it d be much nicer if it was bluetooth instead of having to connect a cable to sync I replaced 5 remotes and it works great for all Sharp TV  LC 80LE844UYamaha receiver  RX V473Sony Blu ray player  BDP BX57DVR receiver  Motorola VIP1216Xbox 360And I ll soon be adding Xbox OneI have a Wii U  but this remote won t work with that  which is fine  because I use Xbox for media streaming Overall  I highly recommend this remote for anyone with the same needs as me 
I have been looking around for memory for my iMac desktop computer and everything was about twice as much as I found at Best Buy    Also is very very easy to install  I just googled a video and it took me less than five minutes  Shipping was very very fast also
Perfect  Great Price  Exactly as advertised       
Easy to install and made the older iMac run much faster  Great add 
I m not going to go to much into it  since many other reviewers have given in depth breakdowns of all this remote s features  pros  and cons  I just wanted to quickly share my experience with this remote  I m using the remote only  with no harmony hub  First off  this remote is about as sexy as remotes can get  It feels great in the hand  and is very ergonomic  all of the buttons are easily accessible with one hand  The battery came with enough juice for me to setup and tinker right out of the box  Setup is a breeze add devices  add activities  add favorites  done in 10 minutes max  I initially had trouble with the activities  The remote was not giving my TV long enough to turn on  so it wasn t switching to the proper input  I though I was going to have to go in and tinker with the delay settings  but the remote asked me if everything went smoothly  and when I told it no  it asked me a few simple questions to determine what went wrong  and get me watching immediately  After that  I had no more issues  Based on my answers to the questions it asked me  it automatically adjusted the delays between commands  no need to hook it back up to my computer  On some of the older harmony remotes that I ve used  you had to turn all of your devices off in order to start a new activity  With this remote  the TV can stay on  When I am in a watch blu ray activity  and I press watch xbox  it turns off my blu ray player  turns on my xbox  and switches the inputs on my TV  fantastic   I can t begin to express how pleased I am with this remote  It replaced 6 big clunky remotes  and works like a charm  That being said  there are 3 features I would like to see added  and they are all things that can be added with a firmware update on Logitech s end  When switching activities  I want it to ask me if I want to power off my current device  instead of just doing it automatically  I would also like the option to have the remote display a clock when docked  that way it serves a purpose when its just sitting there on your end table  It could also serve as a digital picture frame  It could easily store a couple dozen photos  and cycle through them while docked  If those feature were added  then remote controls can be improved upon no further  If you can spare 1  4 G  buy it right now 
Awesome works amazing like it should I will be back
Everything s working perfect just like how it should I love it my systems a Beast
The only thing missing was the ability to record TV shows 
Has all the aspects you want in a remote and controls all of my devices instead my separate remotes for everything 
Works like a dream  The problem seems to be that you now need to download the installation program from the Website  I only needed to transfer my current settings onto a new replacement remote  However hard I tried  I could not get the settings to transfer  But  it finally did download and is fine 
Everyone in my family got tired of having 4 5 remotes to work our TV  DVD player  AppleTV  Sound system and a laptop There was a lot of clutter  not to mention one or two were always disappearing  So I had a friend make a suggestion and he came up with this Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control  915 000224  First  let me say that even after using computers since their inception in the early 80 s I wanted no part in even trying to set this up myself I hired a guy who s in the wiring business of audio video  telephones etc  and he set it up  He s a pro and eventually he did get it all working  but not before having to speak to tech support on more than one occasion  It seems there was a couple of known bugs but you never get that information on the first go round  Anyway  I can say that even the most challenged  technically  member of my family can use it  i e  No more complaining  Now  I breeze through turning everything on and off with just one remote  I like the graphic interface and the ease of its use  I love the fact that you pick it up in a dark room and it lights up automatically so you can see the interface without having to push a button first  This is a really good product  In a sense it is a five star product  losing only one star for the set up issues One other thing to add though  is that there are two parts to the system and  at first  I bought just the remote  I seemed to have missed the fact that you need both the IR Remote AND the Logitech 915 000238 Harmony Home Hub  so I had to buy the other part as well  Note that they are sold together as well as separately but if you buy them both in the same package  it is cheaper than buying them separately 
I love this product  Older versions required you to look up a NOAA locality code online and type it in on the unit s keyboard  a locality code provides weather alerts for a specific locality   This newer model has codes for all states built in  so you just look up your location on the unit  click it  and you are done   a vast set up improvement 
Ergonomics and battery life are terrible  We frequently turn everything off trying to fast forward or rewind  pause or play  Battery life lasts a few days with little use  DO NOT BUY 
It sort of does what it s supposed to do but not very well  About a quarter of the time it doesn t turn on all the components or it turns on the wrong ones so it ends up being more of a hassle to get that one component on than to just use multiple remotes  The touch screen is too sensitive  Constantly hitting something I don t want  This sucks when I m in the middle of a show or movie and it turns it off and starts up another component  I find I use these the most with my DVR  DVD s and CD s but they are awkward to use and I m constantly bumping into the touch screen and I just explained why that sucks  The sensitive touch screen might not be that big of a problem if I didn t accidentally touch it all the time  The way the back of the remote is designed  these buttons are not ergonomically placed  I see that the remote that came out after this one and is now the flagship model is exactly the same but with these buttons moved below the touch screen  If this remote were set up this way  I would most likely give it 4 or even 5 stars if it would reliably turn on all the correct components all the time  
Excellent product for the price  I bought it for my daugter and she love it 
HAHAHAHAHA  I m the master of my own universe again Next  I m going to upgrade this thing to the HUB and hopefully be able to send RF signals too  didn t work why my Roku  
I am an audio junky and a long time fan of Harman products  To me audio quality is the most important thing and these have a very wide response range and are actually very clean sounding for closed back designs  Like the title I chose implies this is the only pair of headphones a person should normally need  I have a pair of open back listening for mixing music and I cant fully retire those but this has everything else  And a tip to the uninitiated the noise canceling is nice for noisy situations but the sound quality is inherently lessened but when you want the full quality it is easy to flip it off and its just astounding  Clean high and deep base  Can play my lossless music extremely well Without that narrow sound you get from the run of the mill headphones  As part of the Harman family they make amazing diaphragms and all around quality is well above the other headphones at this price  I have waited a long time for them to make something like this and I am more than pleased just buy them 
Good quality  reliable  A necessary tool for those in need of convenient security 
So I dix buy this for the mother in law while she watched the house she is very untech savy   Every single day I ve had to re sync and reprogram it  Needless to say my mom in law didn t watch tv that weekend This particular product blows     
For the money i would have expected a more reliable remote  Freezes up quite a bit  No users manual with the remote you have to get it online  and it s not that easy to find the manual online  do not like that you have to go through several screens to get to a number pad    Huge minus for this remote 
As universal remotes go  this one is relatively effective and easy to use  Like a lot of universal remotes  getting to certain equipment specific features to do any AV equipment  tinkering  can be a little cumbersome  But at least it s possible using the universal remotes extensive digital menus without having to grab the original OEM remotes  For normal everyday use  it s quite convenient for setups that might include the combination of an AV receiver  cable  satellite box  streaming box  Blu ray  TV or more  No need to have multiple remotes laying around to control primary functions of the peripherals  And for the most part  I rarely have to dig out one of the equipment specific remotes  But I d probably keep them available  maybe in a drawer or cabinet nearby  if you like to tinker often with equipment specific settings  although it s not absolutely necessary  With a little patience scrolling through the remote digital menu  you ll find just about any function the OEM remotes can perform  and sometimes even more 
Fully functional with easy setup   but the lag time between button push to turning on components is annoyingly long 
This Belkin Portable charger works well and is easy to use 
Easy set up gives you instant WiFi with strong signal
Pulled old cards out  New Cards slid right in and I noticed a huge performance upgrade immediately  Installed in a 2011 iMac desktop  Would definitely recommend for anyone that has the stock 4gb 
The Rene ram was affordable prices at the local store for same day pick up  It was a breeze to install and has solve all the issues
Easy set up and use  Portable and easy  Access  Charges quickly and has long battery usage  Has long range for multiple users  No interruptions encountered  Small enough to keep in case with accessories even when in use 
Greatest soundBest portable bt SpeakerGood side and color
I like how smooth the key board is  The fingerprint logon is very easy to use  It is quiet and smooth 
I misplaced my user manual but quickly found that it tells you what to do when you turn it on  Works great 
I HAD THE GEEK SQUAD SET THE REMOTE UP  THEY DID A GREAT JOB AND THE REMOTE IS SO EASY TO USE  LOVE IT
I purchased the infrared version  instead of the radio model  I wanted to try the infrared first  Works great  but I wish i had gone for a better version  Easy to use  set up in minutes by geek squad 
Set up fairly easy  You need to register to program the remote before you can use it  The LED screen when used is very sensitive and care is needed to avoid unwanted clicks  Takes awhile to get used to the LED screen functions  I prefer the old fashion way with toggle buttons  Biggest issue  buttons are very close to each other  particularly power and rewind button and is easy to push both at same time which interferes with function
Always a fan of Logitech  they make technology easier for people that aren t tech savvy like me 
I had an earlier model of a Harmony remote and loved it    until I dropped it enough times to break off the tabs that secure the battery cover  So I bought this one to replace it  The programming transferred easily via the website  though I did need to contact customer service to discover that I needed a different version of the software than I used with my previous remote  They were very helpful in getting the programming transferred  I discovered that a few controls weren t working as expected  even though they were set properly  but syncing it a 2nd time fixed the problem  I have mixed feelings about the placement of a few of the buttons  but overall I love it  It s slimmer and lighter than my old one  and works very well 
I wanted a battery that would provide dozens of hours of energy  not have too much mass and multitask as another device and the Travel RockStar checks all the boxes  Once charges  it seems to last forever as I just have my lightning cord come out of my backpack to my iPhone  It frees me from searching for outlets as I travel 
I like it and it s very functional just a little too expensive
Product works well but I think I would but the wireless next time for ease of updating 
Good remote it s easy to use it s easy to set up and works great I upgraded from an older model and this one is better
Right out of the box usable charged up in the car on the way home and enjoyed the tunes 
I bought this item because I ve used JVC in the past  I found this model easy to use and it has a great sound for a reasonable price 
Definitely get the Geek Squad to set this up   Well worth the  99  for set up  Now we can flip between audio and video devices with a push of one button  Very easy to use
Still learning what it can do     sound is great     it was a gift
Can control multiple units with ease  Very user friendly 
Had to have the geek squad install it  Way beyond my computer expertise
Handy main menu and quick charging  Works great with the laptop toggled
The netgear wireless adapter is easy to work with and use
Very happy with our purchase  Great price and easy to use
Easy to attach to tablet good size keys finger print id good idea
Had a remote that was impossible to use  this is like using a cell phone
had a smaller harmony remote that couldn t work my home theater   this dose it all
I fine that this is a good one to use and easy too
I liked the product very much  It is handy  Touch screen is good  Easy to configure and easy to use 
I thought using a sling box would be too technical and difficult for me  But it was easy  The instructions are clear  The device is simple to use  And it works just the way that I hoped it would 
Installed it in a 98 ford ranger and it improved my sound system a lot 
love it so easy to use just like using a smart phone
Love love  love it  Glad my son the engineer was home to program it for me  He didn t have any problems though  He ordered one for himself 
Probably the easiest component to set up on my computer and not hard to install 
second Logitech remote Love it Old one 8 yrs old this one is much easier to use
set up not easy need geek squad The geek squad was great
This a perfect for home weather alarms  Every house should have one 
This Microsoft cover and keyboard is easy to use and carry 
This product was very si p e to use and install  If you can t figure out how to use  then go back to kindergarten
This remote is the best purchase I have made  It s ease of use  and I don t have to have 5 remote controls anymore 
this stereo was easy to install andphook up our bluetooth devices 
Very easy to use and simple to understand  It is a lot smaller then my old multi remount  It was a great addition to my home entertainment unit 
Works well for my offsite meetings when I need wifi
This remote comes with a software download that allows for easy configuration of devices through model numbers  then easy setup of actions  It replaced four remotes with multi remote source switching  making watching content from multiple sources a breeze  This remote is so simple to setup and use that even my brother can do it 
This WiFi camera can be used for monitoring pets or children  It could even be used for home security but it s not safe to put outside because it s not weatherproof  It was easy to initially set up  I had to connect to it with my iPad through WiFi and then download the Motorola Hubble Monitor app and it will find and register your camera  Once it s registered you can log in to the app at any time from any place and view live streaming with audio  The video quality is fair but nothing impressive  The audio signal sounds good  There is usually about a 3 5 second delay in the audio and 1 3 second delay in the video feed  I have had no problems logging on and viewing the video feed while I was away from home  You have the ability to view the video and talk to your pet and you can hear them as well  There is a two way microphone so you can actually interact with them even if you are 1000 miles away during a vacation  If you love your pets like I do then you will probably really like this system  The Hubble Monitor app allows you to adjust both sound and motion sensing levels and it will automatically start recording when it either hears a noise or picks up movement  This option will come in handy if you are wanting to check in on your pet while on vacation  You can view the live video but if they aren t currently visible on the camera then you can look at a time earlier in the day when the camera picked them up  The app gives you a timeline with information that is useful like periods of time that were all quiet or times when it picked up noise  It will also tell you when it picks up movement  When it picks up either sound or movement then it will start recording  This camera also has IR night vision and it automatically turns the night vision on when it gets dark  The night vision works well and allows you to get a pretty good video even when it s pitch black out  The range is pretty good too For the time being this recording option is free but it looks like this will be a pay service at some point  According to the hubble connected website it looks like the manual recording and streaming options will remain free but automatic recording is going to be a paid plan that you will have to subscribe to  There will be different paid plans depending on how long you want to be able to store video on the cloud  One option will retain all recorded videos up to 24 hours  The next plan will retain videos for one week and the last plan will retain videos for a month  This is the one thing that I don t like about this system  This camera has a high enough price tag that you shouldn t have to purchase a subscription in my opinion  I do like the system that they set up but again I wouldn t want to pay a monthly subscription fee This camera even takes a temperature reading and displays in on your screen  You can even set it to alert you if the temperature goes below or above a certain level  This is another nice option for me because I can control my thermostat in my house remotely through my nexia home intelligence system if I need to I like this camera quite a bit but I wish it was waterproof and I hope they don t start requiring subscription  Especially considering that there is no warning on the Amazon product page that tells potential customers that they may need to purchase a subscription in the future to get all of the benefits 
Basically plug and play  Very easy  flip the top and your good to go 
Very simple easy to setup remote  Not a wifi remote but is a great product for a simple easy to use remote that you can charge
I was able to add a Projector  Cinema Surround system  Media Hub  Blu Ray and cable box in about 15 minutes  You need an adapter for a Playstation 
This remote operates exactly as advertised  Very easy to set up  I used a Mac   very easy to operate  So far working perfectly   all devices in my system respond quickly to its commands 
Set up was very easy  You have to point it directly at your devices and keep it pointed for sometimes over 1 minute to get them all to turn on  Sometimes I find that not all of the devices turn on or the incorrect setting is selected  It then becomes a little difficult to figure out how to select a specific device to control and to manually configure it 
The remote is very easy to set up and the touch screen is a great feature  You must remember to point it at the devices for a longer than normal amount of time so that it is able to power them all up 
My wife loves it  and since they are making me put in 50 characters here ya go
Universal remote control excellent
This is my third Harmony over the years  and the best one yet  Easy to set up online and so easy to use  Very easy for my Mum to use   she was so confused with multiple remotes  A one stop shop of multi equipment TV  Audio coordination and use 
simple straight out of the box and in use in under 10 mins
Everything was done through the app  Everyone knows how to navigate things through their phone  It took me about 45 minutes from start to finish 
These were easy to replace in my 2011 13 inch Mac and did the job as expected 
Although I didn t buy this at Amazon I thought I would write a review anyway  This is my third Harmony Remote that i ve bought and used  I had a 550  Harmony One and now an Ultimate One  Great upgrade for me and the new software was easier to setup the new remote  In the past i ve had compromises in the programing but now it all works just as it should  The only down side for me is the way it sits in my hand  The bottom is like a bulb  very strange feeling in my hand  Im sure that I will get used to it in time  Bought during the Cyber Monday sale and got a great deal on the remote 
This remote is a breeze to program and the controls are pretty straightforward  I think the design could have been a little more ergonomic as far as fit and feel  The hard keys that control the most accessed functions are poorly located virtually eliminating one handed operation  However  it works well and a well lit keyboard and touch display makes it fairly easy to operate  The big negative is the Li ion batteries are not user replaceable which pretty much guarantees you will be in the market for a new one in a few years  A little pricey for a disposable  It s a shame because I really like the fact that this product works well and effectively eliminates a table full of remotes  I would gladly upgrade to 5 stars if Logitech did a modest redesign to truly make this product best in class 
Does well at controlling components  Changing channels can be a little awkward since there is no number pad 
My wife really likes this remote  Easy to use    the one touch screen really simplifies things 
Easy to program and custom setting   also work with Android TV box Cons  Can t have different list of favorite channels   Direct TV  TV antenna   Harmony 700 can do 
Pro  Does it all  Easy to program Con  Extremely  Highly sensitive touch screen  Shorter battery life than expected  but that may increase over time 
Easy to program  easy to use  Only reason I didn t award 5 stars is because battery lasts half as long as my previous Logitech remote 
once the software was downloaded it was easy to programm
Works well and easy to program  I had a harmony 650 before for another room and this is for the theater room with 5 devices 
Great product easy to pair with varying devices and it was on sale  so even better 
Great product  I would recommend this product to anyone who has to be connected while traveling 
After the basic setup  which was simple enough  the remote works great and controls all the devices I need  Makes me feel more organized 
Gotta love these speakers  As soon as my order came in  I put them out in my yard  The sound immediately popped  with plenty of bass  They are perfect for listening to tunes while barbequeing  swimming or any other backyard activity  I mounted them on the facia of my deck facing my pool patio  I realized after a short rain storm that they could benefit by some coverage from the elements as the manufacturer recommends  I added a small piece of aluminum over each speaker to protect them from sun and the weather  Sprayed black  the covers work well with the speakers  I love them  Can t wait to hook up AirPlay with Apple TV 
Fast  simple installation  Performs exactly as expected  Powerful enough that I have not lost connectivity even once  Highly recommend 
A little pricey  but really easy to use and install  The touch screen has a few scrolling quirks  but that s about it  I must say though that the salesperson told me I could just point it at the TV and all the devices would turn on or off   that is not the case   in face when turning it on a message is displayed stating that the remote must be pointed at all devices 
Easy to install  Even sped up my wife s 5 year Mac book
I wish I had more slots available  Unfortunately  I only had two available  so I put two in mine and the other two in my significant others computer so that worked out great  The hardest part of installing these was having to get down in the floor and drag my tower out of the cabinet  Cough cough  I need to dust under there  Opening the case of the tower was easy  and locating the slots was also easy  First I blew the inside clean with a can of air  then I popped the cards in and put everything back to how it was  Once everything was set up I could tell the difference right away  My computer seems to be responding more quickly  Everything was pretty easy and I was back up and running in no time and my computer isn t nearly as sluggish as it was I actually bought a new computer about a month ago because my computer was so sluggish and it is still sitting in the box waiting for the old one to finally give out  but it s still holding strong and now I think it might actually be a while longer than I thought before I have to finally break it out and set it up  I m very pleased with this product and the extra time it will allow me before my old computer goes belly up  They are working great so far 
I like the wall mount it installed in about 20 minutes  However  I was able to slide the TV from 1 side of the mount to the other and when I did the mount could not hold the weight properly and the TV would move off level 
Installation was easy enough  However it s a pain to keep level  Not sure if I did something wrong or what  Doesn t appear to be anything to tighten to ensure it s level  When I do find that perfect sweet spot it doesn t stay that for very long  Not terrible  but not perfect either 
This mount is sturdy and easy to install  Good range of motion for screen 
Easy to install  Heavy duty  If you do not use the bottom holes for the TV bracket  you must recalculate you TV height when mounted 
Easy to install  Met needs  Highly recommend this to all
I have my remote connected to everything at my house and its east to use
Mount works great  It makes your tv look great  We had a choice of many mounts but the worked out the best for walls with metal studs  tv tilts up and down which is great for tv room watching angles  It is completely invisible behind your tv  I highly recommend this mount 
Very happy with product  easy to install  Great Best Buy customer service 
Easy to hook up and use  I travel a lot and its no hassle bringing the keyboard along with me 
It s easy to carry around  fits in any small bag  the extra base comes in handy  The NCF? Even better  I love it  
This was easy to apply to my tablet in contrast to the one I use for work  the work one required frequent reapplicationsnto get it properly applied
I like the feel of the keys and the overall weight of the key board  The fingerprint ID feature is great for a quick sign in and I like the security it provides  However  sometimes it doesn t recognize my print and I have to log in old school with my password 
Installation is straight forward  and seems to be solidly built  I put this in my bedroom so I could adjust the distance and angle of my TV from the wall to the bed  Handles my 42 LG LED with ease   there s no sagging or problems keeping this in place  It also comes with a plastic piece to help route cables and keep everything neat and tidy I d recommend this to anyone wanting to mount their TV on a wall  Stay away from those 20 TV Mounts  they are garbage and are made out of multiple flimsy pieces of metal  Would you trust your expensive TV to a 20 bargain part
The remote is packed with customizable options  Easy to set up  controls all my products  Brilliant display  Would recommend to friends and family 
I have had harmony remotes well over a decade  I may have been one of the first adopters of them when they originally launched  For the most part they are bullet proof   not dog proof  but that s another story   I have always really liked their remotes  and while this one works well  I would have preferred more hard buttons and less of the touch screen  I often find that I accidentally hit the screen  It should also be mentioned that the help button is a bit more difficult to get to than in the past  Overall  I recommend the product  but I don t believe it is their best 
We purchased this for use when traveling  We have cable with premium channels at home and didn t want to waste that investment when we were  on the road   This made perfect sense to get the best of both worlds 
Love the ability to have it immediately illuminate when picked up or moved so you can see the screen without touching any buttons  Fairly intuitive to setup and a great way to combine your devices into one remote 
At first I was skeptical about buying the item  Now I m glad I followed my first mind  Thanks Best Buy for having the best tech and devices 
This remote is easy to setup and it is great that it is rechargeable 
I was skeptical on the wall mount but with a in wall wiring unit it was simple just make sure to get the lag bolts into the center of a stud 
Harmony remote very easy to set up  AND to use  Best universal remote I have used 
Now I m able to keep up with local news and all of my favorite channels while I m out of town  Why shouldn t I be able to see the cable I pay for on all of my devices without having to pay more to view each one  Especially great if you have a vacation home and don t want to pay for enhanced channels in both places 
The only knock I have on this remote  i haven t researched a solution  is the process of elimination when the devices become out of sync  For example  if I know the HDMI splitter is on the wrong channel  and I hit  Help   I ll have to respond to 7 commands before it s corrected  It d be cooler the remote had an active memory  because it s usually the same fault 
Works very well  Video quality is very good and was very easy to setup  Thanks slingbox 
I upgraded to this model from the original Slingbox  Easy set up and the iPhone and iPad apps work well with nice features  HD is incredible to view on an iPad 
I really like the versatility and set up process for the remote  Setup is easy using the USB connection to your computer  You can program the remote to automatically turn on all devices that you choose for any given activity 
Easy to set up Easy to handle The slim design almost makes my T V  Look like its part off the wall  
This remote is easy to set up and makes one remote do the work of several 
This TV was super easy to set up  We are using it in a play room using on smart tv capabilities  It works very well for these purposes 
Wi Fi made easy  very easy and quick to set up  Easier than expected
Could stand to have a little better instructions for attaching the stand
This radio was easy to install  it was installed in under an hour  Easy to use and set up  I am buying another one today fo my wife s car 
Very easy to write this review  The item had a fast link up  It fill the room with music  Battery lasted a long time  Should ve bought it along time ago 
Great sound for a very good price
Best remote hands down  Don t spend over  200 for a remote  Customer service is great too
Once I removed this beast of a mount from the box I was extremely confident in it s durability of course since I hung the mount and tv myself so I was a little concerned not about the mount but if I had solidly hit my wall studs all is well I have even actuated the arms with fluidity in motion to view my television in the dinning room  I love this thing
Having never installed extra RAM into a computer  this was easy  And  it helped a lot in the speed of our iMac 
This remote is very easy to program  You do need to jot down your model numbers of the units of your entertainment system  Other than that the program on line walks you through the setup process  I have the Sonos Playbar and it works amazing  I did have to call customer service for some added help in making sure every device like my Roku 4 was identified with the correct input  Took about 10 minutes on the phone  Works great  I also like the icon s on it showing the different television stations  All in all much better than purchasing a remote from Magnolia for  500  not to mention everytime you change a piece in your entertainment system you have to have the geek squad come out and re program it at  149 a pop 
Everything that I expected  Easy mount once you ID hole locations  Read the directions and do the calcs to be sure you put the holes where they belong  Much lower price from Amazon vendor  Thank you 
These were easy to install  LIked that can adjust the tweeter for directional sound  Very good value for the price 
Nice radio will buy another one in the future a   
easy installation  Came with all the tools and parts  nothing missing 
Instructions were easy to follow and everything I needed was included in package 
I have had this TV mount for a while now  holding up older 47  TCL LED TV  Takes weight very well I m sure it could hold up two of them    Easy install when studs are found and properly leveled  Movement very smooth and perfect for corners if your looking to pull out at angle  Overall great product wish the price point was a little better  but if you have the money no need to struggle on decision 
Easy install in my jeep  had no issues connecting my XM tuner  I now have XM in my  79 CJ and a much better radio than before  I never have a top on and don t mind driving in the rain  This deck had been rained on hard and doesn t have a single issue  Well worth the money even if you put it in a vehicle that it won t get wet in I needed something with Bluetooth because it s impossible to hear my phone  and most times feel it  ring when i take the jeep out  This wouldn t be an issue except my job requires that I am available 24  7  With that said the Bluetooth works fine at slow speeds  this had me pleasantly surprised  but is impossible to speak at highway speeds  I knew this would happen and only wanted something to let me know a call was coming in  which out does very well 
Sound is good and radio stations stay locked  real good radio
Very easy to install  but I suggest upgrading the hard drive to an ssd to get the full potential out of the ram  Also on the upside the computer runs faster than when first purchased  Upgrades were performed to an early 2011 13  MacBook 
bought for 13inch macbook pro 2010 easy install  power on with no problems 
Great for movie surround sound  Great for movies with sound effects
Great product quality very simple install very affordable
The setup went well and hassle free  Operation of the machine is great since adding 
These were very easy to install in my Mac  I m very pleased with the increased speed and lower memory consumption 
Great product  Offers so many options and insalled in minutes  Love it 
Now I have Sirius radio from my personal to ANY company vehicle  I can connect to any truck in seconds 
Had it up and working about 10 minutes after opening box  Downloaded the app for iPhone  and for PC  which installed without problems  Then was able to open the app and watch streaming TV immediately  Later use confirmed Slingbox as a quality streamer and very easy to use 
I use these remotes a lot in installations when replacing propriety remotes from other installers  This remote is easy enough for anyone to program and the software is free and keeps all your programing in the cloud so if you have to replace a broken remote its a cakewalk 
Nice picture on apps  Easy to use and you control you TV  
This was a Christmas gift for my son  He said it arrived on time  and works great We were both dubious about the small size of the speakers  but he says it sounds great  Also  his artist significant other approves the appearance  you don t see it   just hear it 
Set up was faster than I expected but you do need to reset your output if you switch from component to s video  Seems to have less drop frames and freezes than the last model 
I use this on the floor of what plants I work in  Very flexible to set on a table or chair to type with pull off to use computer in hands then plug back in to finish what I have to do 1 handed use very easily to reattach  The finger print is easy start up and go 
Makes connecting to your cable box remotely a breeze 
Easy to setup and use  The help feature is AWSOME    It makes the correction for you 
The process it took to add my fingerprint and have it be accurate was very short and easily done 
The Logitech Harmony One is the easiest remote to program  Even the unique devices have the remote codes available  Setup instructions are complete and accurate  However  multiple activations sometimes have devices that get out of synchronization with on   off control  Also  the touch screen is a bit touchy  causing inadvertent actions 
I had a harmony one  Had a geek squad member setup of the One and even he had problems  I was able to set up the remote and even had the ability to set a delay to allow the tv time to power up and change to the correct input  Why did I wait sooooo long 
I am a long time Logitech Harmony remote customer  Their products are not perfect and I have had some sort of reliability issue with everyone I have purchased but have stayed with them because there is nothing else on the market that is as easy for a DIY to program and set up  This remote works great  easy to use and the simplest for me to set up  It imported all of my settings from my 880 and I only had to make one minor adjustment and were good to go  I just hope this one doesn t have battery or charging issues after 6 months  1 year like all of other ones I have owned  Keeping my fingers crossed 
I use as back up for company s unreliable internet connection  I need it to boot up and connect fast  It does and I share with 10 other computers in office  until office system is repaired  Works like a champ  and is very fast 
Keyboard works great and fingerprint ID speeds login prices and adds extra security 
I bought this bag about a month ago and love the ease of use   I can throw it over my shoulder and am able to swing it around to remove the camera without setting it on the ground 
I found this product to be very easy to use  Activating the finger print feature was simple as well 
This remote is very user friendly  Even those that are technically challenged can operate 
I ve only had this Dell computer for a short time  but so far it has been great  It is replacing an  All in one  that died  We have been having trouble with our internet service  so I can t comment much on the speed  but even with the flakey internet it seems better than my old Dell 
MegablastSetup I encountered firmware update issues during setup   so I had to continue setup   go back to update  took a few times  then was finally successful  Usage    Buttons You have to be dead center on the large buttons  At the top of the  volume down    it feels like you re hitting a button  feels springy   but you re not   you have to go lower and the volume will decrease  The  volume up  will accept a lower press to raise the volume  Unlike my  99 Wonderboom  you can t pair more of these speakers that are ~3x the price for a better surround sound  Say whaaat?The sound is a typical UE sound   it s really clean   bassy  It s heavy  but it s grippy   portable   I dig it  It has its own independent sound control   so  raising    lowering volume doesn t change the phone s volume as some devices do  which is where you run into the volume being too low   or just a bit too loud   I ve had this before   it s nice that the Megablast is not following that example  Charging the unit appears to make you put it on its side to get to the connector and there s no way it ll be able to stand once you hook up the USB cable  Enter the  POWER UP  charging dock   which gives you a replacement nut at the bottom allowing standing charging   use  It s an extra  40 or so  but is worth it  should you really use this a ton   don t want the aggravation Bluetooth Usage If you re streaming via bluetooth and ask Alexa a question  it kills the bluetooth connection   doesn t auto reconnect to continue playing There are Bluetooth reconnect issues too   I use a few BT devices  even a UE Wonderboom  so it s not my first rodeo  If I disconnect from those  I can reconnect without issue  With this Megablast  sometimes I have to cycle Bluetooth on my phone   then it works  And I ll hear some static during the reconnect too  which is odd   Alexa  Features Voice recognition is 4  5 times successful for acknowledging that it heard me  Via the UE App  you can toggle the  microphone off    so it s not always listening  small red light appears on the top at the bluetooth button   There is no tone to let you know it has heard the wake word  it should be an option at least   but the top light blinks It can t tell how much battery remains   I don t have a battery  As of Mid November 2017  there was no Pandora integration yet   though it responds like it s getting my station   but voices an error  There must be an update coming soon  fingers crossed   It doesn t work well with Amazon Prime Music  It says it s going to shuffle my collection  but it pauses for a long time and then only sometimes starts playing  then cuts out Smart ish Home Thoughts     I could control my HUE lights via room names   the ever finicky Harmony Hub without issue  just as my Tap does   no issues seen here  So  the recommendation is a  yes  for the sound   you just need to be patient   hope that these  smart  quirks get worked out soon 
Sensitive mic makes it easy to get Alexas attention  but theres no easy indicator to tell if it recognizes your voice  Speaker qualities are fantastic  surround sound  casting  streaming  bluetooth capabilities  light and portable and can withstand drops  A great buy 
Dog ate my Harmony One Advanced remote   it was a great remote This one  the Ultimate One IR Remote  is not nearly as stable or useful as the original  The touch screen is touchy and cranky  It is VERY sensitive to the angle and pressure you use to activate functions frequently selecting channels you didn t    No matter how many times I program it   it continues to confuse the BD  BlueRay  and TV  SAT  Dish  selections   requiring either the Help button or a manual input to make the desired selection  It is slower in executing commands than the original  I hope Logitech Management reads this   However  it works  mostly  and is better than a side table full of disparate remotes EDIT  22 September 2014   Still have to keep a couple of the old device specific remotes handy  For example the Ultimate One does not mirror all controls of my Panasonic BD Player   once in a while I have to use the original remote for accessing all the settings or functions  Battery life is a joke   a couple of days off the charger and it dies  The more I use the Ultimate One the more I dislike the nameless engineer who designed this mediocre excuse for a Universal remote  I have downgraded the original 3 Stars to a more appropriate 2 Stars EDIT  12 December 2014   DO NOT BUY THIS FRUSTRATING  POORLY DESIGNED GARBAGE  Thinking maybe a firmware update could help with this device s erratic stability problems I went to the Logitech site  This piece of junk is no longer even mentioned or carried on the site  The Ultimate One form factor is non existant  Poof  Gone away  When a manufacturer will not acknowledge one of their products then you should RUN away from purchasing it  Dropped to 1 Star rating 
Could not configure these drives for any level of RAID on my DNS 343  Had to use them as only single drives 
Set up is easy  Picture is great and the sound is excellent  even without an extra sound system 
I like the clarity of these speakers  I also like how good they sound when hooked up to an amp 
My first Harmony remote did not survive a drop on the floor  The second one died when the cat knocked it on the floor  I was dismayed when I learned that the old model was no longer available and at the price of the new one  I was also a bit taken aback by the negative comments of some reviewers regarding the Harmony Ultimate One  I am pleased to report that after using the new model for a few weeks  my fears were groundless  My old system setup transferred to the new device using the online programming with only a moderate amount of confusion and hair pulling  I find the new display empowering  Several of the buttons are not in what I would consider the optimal locations but I don t find that to be a major problem  Overall  I m very happy with this unit There was also some confusion on my part about some kind of ultimate hub device  It does NOT come with the Ultimate One package that I purchased nor was it needed to control my devices  I m still not clear on what it is  but that doesn t matter as I don t need it Oh yes  this time we built a little wooden box with an open top in which to house the controller and its charger base  and also a portable telephone and charger base   The cat will have a hard time damaging THIS controller  On the down side  I recently bought a cordless mouse and this morning I had to hunt to find where the cat left it  But that s another story 
This unit is awful  It has nice features  but the amplifier is pitiful  You can look at the size of the speaker wire lines and tell there is no power in the amp  I ended up going back to an old Sony cassette player I had in the garage which sounds superior  Its a shameSony has resorted to this 
Don t buy it  Save yourself the hours of aggravation  The remote seizes control of your home theater system and it is nearly impossible to make your stereo to work without the remote  The touch screen is amazingly difficult to control  When you try to scroll through the screen you accidentally turn on your dvd player instead of turning on your stereo  Moreover  the display inexplicably changes from one day to the next  Last night  I spent hours and hours trying to get my I pod to play music on my brand new stereo  I failed repeatedly  Are you a fan of software updates Get ready  this device constantly sends itself needless software updates  It s as though this device was designed to frustrate the user instead of enhancing the home theater experience  Wow  how I wish that I never bought this remote 
I returned because it didnt work in this Alienware   Aurora Desktop   Intel Core i7   8GB Memory   NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970   1TB Hard Drive   Epic silverEither the memory s fault or PC  they both get a  1 
I didn t realize the cost of this remote until after I fell in love with it  Power everything from one remote  Easy to set up  charges quickly  really simple to use  Really like not have to hunt down 3 different remotes  it really is a cool universal remote
Don t like the shape   it makes it bottom heavy  The off  FF  rewind  play buttons being at the top of the remote make it awkward to use 
I replaced my Pioneer AppRadio 2 with the Alpine iLX 007  The AppRadio was the worst  full of bugs  new app releases were like rolling the dice I was excited about CarPlay and I m depending on Apple to handle software where Pioneer was inept  So the unit works great and is responsive  But there are two big problems 1  Spotify doesn t work 3  4 of the time  I asked Alpine Tech Support  much more responsive and nicer than Pioneer s  if they had a procedure to bring back Spotify to life  they did not  They said that this is an Apple problem and they must fix it 2  The CarPlay version of Apple Maps has two problems  First  you cannot use the touch screen to move or size the map like you do on the iPhone  Instead you have to bounce around with buttons for zooming and moving  Really stupid Also traffic doesn t seem to work in CarPlay  Even on the iPhone  traffic is terrible and doesn t show as black  red  yellow or green like in all other map apps like Google Maps  Please Apple  its not that hard to know what people like  It would seem that the 34 Car Manufacturers listed on Apple s CarPlay site would expect stuff to be a lot better  Too bad Alpine gets beat up for Apple s ineptness Things Alpine  non CarPlay  needs to improve 1  No way to turn off the AM  FM Radio2  The Graphic EQ screen can only be accessed from the iPhone s screen  not the Car Unit  Really?
I have had a logitech harmony remote for about 10 years and wouldn t want to have to deal without one  One touch turns on the TV and my Sony sound system  dvd player and the it is ready to watch tv by controlling my Tivo and volume etc  This new one has updated features like a touch screen and it is taking some time for me to get used to  It functions differently than my previous model but is much more flexible and can do much more with less programming  I think this one might be easier  less techy  to set up because now you don t have to do so much of your own programming  but instead you have to learn how to use the devices feature  But in the end  we watch a samsung tv  change the channels on a Tivo and control surround sound from our Sony home theater and if we chose to  we can record a program on our Toshiba DVD burner using nothing but this one Logitech programmable remote 
Used this to update a 2010 MacBook it help with being slow 
Someone complained about the noise and lives 6 miles away in a different neighborhood  Rich powerful sound and has visual stimulation with LEDs that will change colors at 200bpm precisely  I don t know how they make the lights go with the music but it is a really neat feature  Also sounds excellent with any music genre at any volume unless you re trying to have a party with more than like 200 people 
Worst remote ever  Does not control my dvr or Blu ray player  Oh  it turns them on  it just doesn t let you fast toward  pause or play  Miss the Harmony One  I will never buy another Logitech product again 
This remote is not user friendly  It is not ergonomic  and you have to use both hands to get it to work properly  The numbers on the screen do not always respond properly  and it will end up doing something you didn t plan on  The buttons are too close together causing incorrect inputs if you re not careful  If I still had the box  it would be returned by now  Get one without the screen input  Buttons only 
LOGITECH DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS   DONT BUY LOGITECH   after buying 4 remotes and two diNovo keyboards   so I was a good repeat customer  I bought a refurbished harmony 900 direct from the Logitech website  after getting the remote when I went to use it and called customer support they said I was out of my 90 day support window  I said no way  I just bought this  They had an in service date that was the original in service date of the first guy who bought the remote and in the company system had it been registered as defective  phone support would not help me  when I tried to connect the remote through the web app a message said this remote was returned as defective and has been disabled  Then when I called back they wanted me to buy a support call to talk further  They stole my money by selling me an unusable nonworking defective device and then the customer service was so lame that the call center guys could do nothing  several emails to the company have gone unanswered  I will never buy another Logitech device until  unless they respond to me and stand behind their device  I strongly suggest you NOT BUY LOGITECH not because their products are horrible but because the company is horrible and doesn t give a damn about its customers 
Bought the Logitech Harmony Ultimate One about four months ago  Worked great until last Friday when the screen went all white so I checked the Internet and got the suggestion to reboot the unit by holding down the OFF  MENU buttons for 15 seconds  This shut the unit down and that was it  Can t restart it so it s now a paperweight  Also  forget about any help from Logitech  that s nonexistent  Live and learn  will NEVER buy anything from Logitech again 
I bought this for my elderly mother  who has trouble working the remote that came from the cable company She never uses it I ve found that she can t get the hang of swip  touch controls be it on this or a tablet  She gets it messed up  and then gets frustrated I am pretty tech savvy  and even I find it easy to accidentally get on screens I don t want to be on  The icons on the screen are also to small and don t always show up well I actually liked the screen set up on the 1100 model better  but they don t make that anymore  It had it s problems too I like the button set up on this model better  but I wouldn t buy either one again 
Volume button is too loose and changes volume when riding motorcycle  
After reading the nasty reviews of this quality product  I had 2nd thoughts about the purchase  After my 1st use  I was convinced that this is not only a huge improvement over my Harmony 890  but might just be the  perfect  universal remote  Setup was dead easy and took only a few minutes while the setup software copied the settings from my 890  The touch screen eliminates all of the ergonomic  issues that have been ballyhooed in those ugly reviews  And  I haven t even delved into the macro possibilities of the touch screen  That I will save for a quieter day  I purchased the 200 model as I do not see the need for my remote to close the drapes or turn on the lights  A nice price for an excellent product 
I specifically searched RF remote and this is what came up  IT IS NOT AN RF REMOTE AND WILL ONLY CONTROL DEVICES IT IS POINTED AT   
not good for the price  did not meet sound volume and sound quality
I purchased 3 of these to use in  Qnap nas  I chose WD red due to their reputation of reliability  I have had a few WD red drive in other devices and they have all held up without issues So far so good on all 3 drives  I trust my content living on these drives 
Got these for my new build and i have 0 complaints so far  PC is very snappy with this memory  Some Motherboards default to 2133  check your bios 
Doesn t work with Safari and they don t tell you that We had to call their troubleshooting dept  to find out The support team was helpful Instructions aren t clear and the iPhone controls are poorly arranged We are able to watch our home base tv from another state 
Doesn t work well with my Vizio TV and none of the Internet apps work with this remote  I ll be returning this thing and using my factory vizio remote 
The keyboard is necessary to use the surface pro  The surface does not co operate well with generic wireless keyboards  so I was forced to purchase this one  Typing is very bothersome  for whatever reason the mousepad is overly sensitive and just hitting regular keys results in mouseclicks that put the cursor anywhere on the screen  I m very disappointed at the very poor quality of this keyboard 
cannot seem to keep the programming It will work a few times  then it won t
Was looking for a control to connect with all my equipment  Had a Harmony  replaced with an upgraded Harmony 
I needed to control 5 devices without digging out the remotes  This did the trick and a full charge lasts long  Since I put it in the charger before going to bed  I can t say how long the charge actually lasts 
I own a couple of these  They work well  but programming is a significant time investment  I really wish there was an easier way  Plus batteries seem to die quickly  but I am terrible about charging 
Depending on what you want from it  this may or may not be more useful to you than it is for me  It streams live TV very well  and very clearly if you have a good WiFi connection  But I travel a lot and bought it to watch DVR recordings while in my hotel room  If I want to watch live TV I can just turn on the one in my room  Trying to watch recorded shows is very frustrating because of the extreme lag when using the fast forward or rewind functions connected to my DVR at home  Also  if someone is watching TV at home  you are fighting over the same DVR  TV 
So far it seems to work well  It doesn t take CDs but who uses those now anyway  I haven t explored the Pandora and iHeartRadio options  but the Bluetooth is easy and cable free  which is awesome
I bought this remote to replace an old Harmony One  and so far it has been a good replacement  It does NOT operate devices out of line of sight  there has been some confusion in earlier reviews regarding this  even though there s nothing in the description that says that it does   which is fine for me all of my devices are behind glass and this works just fine  If you need beyond line of sight functionality you ll have to spring for the more expensive version with the hub Setup was easier than my old remote  the web based setup had a better knowledge of the actual names of the inputs and outputs on my receiver  so there was no trial and error as could happen with the older model  All told  setup took about 10 minutes most of this was waiting for a firmware update  Actual defining of activities  devices  and inputs took only a few minutes and worked the first time All that said  the ergonomics of this remote are not as good as the old Harmony One  The lack of a hardware number pad is unfortunate but a reasonable tradeoff for the reduced size  but the real problem is the placement of the DVR controls on the top  It s annoying and forces you to move your hands too much for these commonly used controls  Besides this  it s a nice remote and I plan to use it for a long time 
We were forced to add a cable box as Charter cable switched service to all digital cable in our area Charter Cable supplied a universal remote with the cable box but it left a lot to be desired when it came to switching between the TV  cable box  and Blu ray player  My wife was having a difficuilt time juggling 3 remotes to select the right TV input and switch between the Blu ray player and cable box So  a quick trip to my local Best Buy and I picked up the Logitech   Harmony Ultimate One universal remote  Took it home  opened the box and conected it to our PC after downloading the Logitech software  A few quick klicks to enter our equippment for remote control and mabye 10 minutes to load 50 favorite channels and Voil� We now have a one button push solution to  Watch TV  and a one button push to  Watch a Move   The Logitech remote also has a  Sleep Timer Function  to shut everything down   great feature as we use this TV in the bedroom  Happy wife   happy life Thinking about buying a second one it they come down in price

I ve been a SlingBox user for over 10 years  I ve been enjoying watching my TV in Japan  Europe and many places in the US that isn t home  Great way to stay up on recorded shows and local sports 
We needed a replacement charger  Works as described
Streaming requires high speed internet and a strong wifi signal to work properly 
Not the fastest RAM out there  but definitely will be compatible with any DDR4 motherboard you re working with  Aesthetically not too appealing  but could be if you have a blue build  16GB is the way to go if you re doing anything heavily intensive gaming wise 
No I can watch allMy sports channels on the go and at my computer at work 
I needed to replace my old wireless adapter so I did the price felt really steep but that s because i m pretty broke atm  v
I wish it had more presets  the iPhone setup was tricky  the menu is difficult to navigate  Glad this was on sale when I bought it or I would only give it 2 stars   for the price in my 3rd car it s fine  Would not get for everyday car though 
This is my third sling box and the least expensive  The first two lasted several years and then started to falter 
There s not much to complain about as far as the travel surge protection goes  However  it could be a 4 star product if the battery had more juice than just about 1 full charge for an iPhone 6s 
does the job   make sure you check mobo compatibility though  These aren t usually listed
for someone who wants to watch his or her team from another city  this can do the trick  ive been using this thing for a few weeks now and I am able to watch all of my games  it takes some time to get used to the device on the other side once it is set up  and if you have the amazon fire stick  you don t need to use your phone or tablet to watch on your tv  which is awesome  The biggest complaint i have is the quality of the video  but that can be because of my internet speed  I have 100mbps which comcast says is upgraded from the normal 25 mbps  but maybe it is still not enough to get the quality i was hoping for when streaming my tv from another city  all in all  i can watch my games  and there usually isn t too much that gets in the way of that once i got this thing all set up 
I had to upgrade my slingbox from the classic due to my directv box upgrade  It does the job well  There are some streaming hiccups here and there but I think it may be my network  The Mac app doesn t work with this slingbox but the web browser does work  The iOS apps still work fine with this one 
It s great to be able check in on the dog during the day to make sure he s comfortable and behaving well  I d like to see better resolution on the camera but it works well 
Took away one star due to lag  Every time you press a button on the virtual remote  there is noticeable and significant delay  and the stream actual freezes  not sure why  Video streams great  but controls are kind of clunky  I use the IR cable  due to device location  not sure if that introduces the lag  Other than waiting for the device to respond after remote commands  it works great 
Works for connection to the web  Bought for when travelling  all those  free  connections 
These are perfect for upgrading older iMac Minis  Just pop the top  remove the old RAM and plug these in  They won t necessarily transform your machine into a powerhouse like a SSD will  but they can help with preventing memory paging  which is another performance killer 
When I got this it had a attached cover letter to help you get started  Didn t work for me  First  I could not find the Android App in the Play Store  There were other similar Apps but none of them looked like they were applicable  And their reviews were not very good  So I went to my Apple iPad and found a App there  During the setup the speaker itself needed to be set up on my WiFi  I did that and then it failed several times to connect to a update server  I have a limited WiFi connection and this chewed up about 300 Megs and still not a peep out of the speaker  I think this device is way too complicated for the average user 
Does not work with home hub  Info on Logitech site very confusing  Did not work as expected or planned based on research and confusing and inconsistent info on forums and website
I bought a previous Sling product because Best Buy said it supported Mac  Windows  like this one says   Used it for a while with my laptop on trips  worked fine  until Sling decided they would no longer support Vista  There was NO warning about this when I paid for it  Now I have a ridiculously expensive paper weight unless I buy a whole new laptop that I don t need  I expect Windows 7 support will be next to go away  I wouldn t even be concerned if I simply couldn t call in for support  no  it just doesn t work at all  check the internet  including their own site  for all kinds of disgruntled customers in the same boat  Unless you plan on throwing away money by continuously updating equipment and operating systems that you don t need  plan on this being obsolete as soon as Microsoft comes out with another operating system or two   And that is only if you have Windows 10 now  if you have Windows 7 or 8  it will useless be sooner   No more Sling products for me  Very poor recognition of customer needs 
Probably one of the worst products I ve ever purchased  Extremely inconsistent with wi fi  It rarely works  and when it does  streaming is variable and disconnections are frequent  I ve tried different ISPs and routers  all to no avail  Customer service is non existent  I would definitely suggest not purchasing a Slingbox product unless you are prepared to ethernet it directly  
Easy to install and easy to use  Looks good  reads music off of a USB drive as advertised  and bluetooth setup to my phone was a snap  FM reception is fine  and RDS works great  and the price is fair  Be aware that the remote that comes with it is a small handheld IR thing  not RF  and needs to have line of sight to the faceplate to work  It won t work If your radio is mounted below deck or in a box I liked this product enough in the first week to try and buy the RM X11M wired accessory remote that is called out in the manual  since the IR remote won t work for me from the helm  Unfortunately  Sony has discontinued the RM X11M remote  and it is no longer available for purchase  Sony support says that they no longer produce ANY wired remote that works with this head unit  and I ve not managed to find any 3rd party remote that will work So   its a nice unit as long as you don t buy it expecting to use the wired remote that the documentation claims is available  I m very disappointed that Sony would discontinue the remote for a radio that they produced less than a year ago 
This does not move as easily as they say it will  glide is an overstatement  It works but just not easy to maneuver 
I bought this mount for my 70  sharp aquos and it does not support the weight when extending it away from the wall  It tilts to one side or the other if it is not perfectly centered  and not by just a little 
Does work better than having three or four separate remotes
Does more than I need but it s touch screen is a temperamental thing 
I have no issues and am nothing but happy with my purchase 
My friends point out that there s less expensive ones available through other sites but I m loyal to best buy I liked this arm because it doesn t sag like the single arm mounts that look sexier  but really couldn t hold my 65 inch tv  This one doesn t sag and does the job  We couldn t really say that we re going to be swiveling the tv out 180 degrees  Ask yourself the same before you drop more money on the single arm ones 
It s not a head turner but it does it s job well  Applications run quick
We needed a good device to charge our cell phones and this does the trick 
Does exactly what it s supposed to do and well  No complaints here 
Great only thing is I wish you could connect your phone wirelessly 
this is idiot proof  my mom can even use it and she is not a fan of technology  This even recognized the PC i have attached to the tv 
This remote does way more than I would ever need but I am pleased that I can upgrade as needed 
Really good automated remote  Set up is not bad  Controls everything fine  The touch screen works well and I like the extra options for favorite channels and some other things  The touch screen volume and channel change is tough to use and gets in the way  I turned that function off  The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that there is not enough manual set up options  I wanted to configure a device slightly differently  but the software would not let me  the option just wasn t there  Not a big deal  but does cause some minor inconvenience Bottom line    Would recommend to a friend 
We purchased this item in November  It took us a few weeks before we set it up and by January it wasn t charging any longer  I contacted their customer service by Feb  3  They were very responsive at first but three weeks went by without responding to my email  I called today and was told they never received my email and I needed to provide the information again  Once they review it  I will need to return the speaker to them before they will provide a new speaker  If you don t mind having your unit fail after light use for two months and jump through a bunch of hoops to get a replacement and not having your speaker for a few months  then this unit is fine 
Yes  It is small  But the output is clear  The volume is load  We were able to use it to an auditorium for a practice  The batter last long  Portable and easy to carry 
This is the most complicated and difficult remote I have ever worked with  The screen is too sensitive or not sensitive enough  It is difficult to program and the direction are so difficult to understand you just want to throw them in the trash along with the remote  I have a friend who is employed as a computer tech and they could not figure it all out  What a mess 
This remote has never worked right  I have started over setting it up 3 times and it always ends up not working correctly after a few weeks  It never changes the devices to the correct settings  I have to use the Fix it Myself option EVERY time I make a switch to a new mode or turn on my devices  It is not worth the money or frustration  I have defaulted back to using 3 different remotes  much easier 
I downloaded the Harmony software  I setup the tv and cable box then hit the sync button  It didn t sync  I tried on another computer  Same thing  I called support and followed their instructions  Same problem  Called tech once more  Same instructions  Tried once more  Same problem  Disappointed  I have a Harmony 6 years old and have never had a problem  I returned the Ultimate 
Can only stream so much data  I m only able to use it a week at its full potential
bought these headphones hoping they would be comparable to the Bose  they are not  connection is a pain and once connected  audio issues make listening less than enjoyable  sound quality is irrelevant  the cracking  skipping makes me want to take them off immediately  very disappointed i wasted my time on these
We bought the remote for a closed door cabinet based on the description  Unfortunately after receiving the remote and before opening the package  we read that you must purchase another device for that feature to work  It was quickly returned 
I purchased this to replace my beloved harmony one  This can t hold a candle to the harmony one  It s curved bottom prevents it from resting flatly on a table  It is so sensitive I can t pick it up without triggering some random function  It is uncomfortable to hold and quite difficult to operate  Overall  a big disappointment  Does anyone have a harmony one they want to sell?
good sound but     will not stay on my ears or headuseless if will not stay on my headalso gave it to a friend to see if it was just me but he had the same problems with the headset
I�ve had this tv for a little over a week  It�s going back tomorrow  The screen goes dim even after you adjust the setting and now I�m having no sound issues  There is clean picture with absolutely no sound  It just goes out  Two days in a row  Great price  but not worth it  Scared to keep it with issues like this within a week  My other Samsung tv in my living room has none of these issues and it�s about 2 3 years old  Also  the SmartHub apps run really slow  May pay the difference and get the 4K or switch out of the brand altogether  Very disappointing  Samsung 
The sound  low or high sounds too good to be TRUEbut it has no Stereo headphone Jacks   If I had known this  I never would have purchased it 
Either a bad install by Gerk Squad or this product just doesn t work well  Can t get Geek Squad out to fix it  Bad 
Husband been wanting and purchased for his birthday  As soon he opens  a big part of the ear muff is ripped  Did not even had the chance to listen to it  Was very disappointed on the quality for the price we paid 
I had a sales perso check to see if this was the correct memory for my computer  I found out that it was not and will be returning it
Turns out  this very expensive remote can t handle an Amazon Fire TV device  total disappointment 
Wouldn t charge at all even though it was brand new 
First time I have ever bought a Desk top and not be able to get it working and on line in an hour   three days  I have no idea who to blame  Windows 10? Dell for having 2 Vid drives on line at same time? Sales Rep for not understanding that my existing Monitor from 2003 is still operational and functional? Any way you slice it my experience has been less than satisfactory 
For  250  I have to say that I m very disappointed with this remote  About once a week it freezes and the only way to unfreeze it is to charge it for a few seconds  It s also annoying that it has to be pointed at just the right spot on my receiver and held there for several seconds to turn the tv on or off  It also doesn t seem to have a way to turn on closed captioning  The remote was originally set up by a Best Buy Geek  which was great   but he used his computer to set it up  The MyHarmony software won t load on my MacBook Pro  and when I called the MyHarmony support for help in loading the software  their solution was to use a different computer 
I HAD GREAT HOPES FOR THIS UNITUPON OPENING THE UNIT AND READING FURTHER ABOUT THE UNIT I DISCOVERED IT WAS NOT BLUETOOTHI RETURNED IT   EXCHANGED IT FOR A BLUETOOTH UNIT
I was really disappointed with these headphones  When wired  with noise cancelling off  they sounded great  But  when you turn on the noise cancelling  you lose your highs  your volume  and the overall sound becomes  what I can only describe as  muddy  Go wireless  and the sound gets worse  There are very audible artifacts that MAY become white noise after a while  but for  300 headphones are unacceptable  Additionally  these phones can only be paired with one device at a time and the associated smartphone app is mediocre at best I ve owned a pair of Bose QC15s for some time and love them  While you do give up SOME sound quality with the NC  nature of the beast  I guess   the sound is fuller  richer than the JBLs  I guess I ll stick with wired for now 
Sound was low  and distorted when sound was turned up  Music didn t project well in a small room 
I purchased these speakers as rear speakers for my Sony 4KHDR TV  They worked at first  then quit  Had the Geek Squad over again to re set  Worked for about 2 days  They are also difficult to set up Bluetooth  Wish I would not have purchased  They are sitting on a table  not being used  Expensive ornament 
The speaker has great sound but after playing for a couple of hours the volume goes out on its own  Very disappointed 
I like this unit because I can connect my phone via Bluetooth to listen to my pandora stations and it has a microphone for hands free phone so when you receive a call you will here it thru your vehicle speakers
Unable to complete set up process on two computers  Returned device and purchased another with the same problem  Scheduled Geek Squad to help 2 times  Geek Squad sent Best Buy repair person who does NOT work on Harmony device  Returning device and going to Frys to purchase a different device  Phone system at Best Buy  Geeksquad is too difficult and frustrating to use  After attempting to talk to someone 10  times we are closing our accounts at Best Buy 
Almost impossible to read the screen  Only shows the artist and not the name of the song  The preset buttons are too small 
Spent two weeks and maybe 10 hours of actual research time on Internet to get to full operation  Impossible to live with if hub is not used  Works great after the job was done  Most people would have given up but I have a wife and she badgered me until it worked perfectly  I think that the technical issues are slowly being addressed by Logitech as this new series of remotes are coming out  Harmony Elite version with hub is simpler  system took about 5 min and is awesome 
WE were tired of having 5 romotes laying around  Our Best Buy Guy suggested this Harmony remote  Geek squad set it up for us when they delivered our tv and blu ray  I m a Mac person  so it seemed pretty user friendly to me with it s menus  My husband is not really a Mac person  so it took just a little bit  but I think he finds it s user friendly  Have to put it in the stand to recharge when it gets low   not used to that 
It is good to be able to use USB and grounded outlets 
I bought this desktop for my son s but it supposed to install AMD Redeon rx560   but there is rx460    i need to exchange this desktop for correct graphic card  
Purchased this in hopes that someone could set it up for me to record and watch NCAA Football games overseas when I travel  I did so despite reservations that Sling no longer provides support  updates  etc  Three competent people worked with me on it  a guy who installs cable for a major cable company  an IT prof for a large office  and a guy who works does audio  visual for a production studio   We couldn t get it to work   the slingbox could not recognize a cable box from Time Warner and multiple calls to Sling s support did not solve the problem I used to use sling for several years and even used the hopper by dish with good success  Looks like they have fallen off in their support with all the competition  It is a shame because it is a great item for expats and people who travel internationally frequently   probably just to small a market share 
the sling box is perfect for some but not for all 
Unless you put the remote back in the cradle every day the batteries go dead in 3 days  Must look at remote to do simple things like volume control or change channels  Should be intuitive by feeling the control buttons  The lesser model universal remote is more user friendly 
Forget it if you have RF controls  This is only for IR controls  Overpriced and it tends to lose its settings 
I wish i could have kept these speakers because they sounded great but the car called for shallow speaker which are hard to find and very expensive so i had to go with 6  kickers and drill mounting for them 
The unit was a little bulky  I did not experience the advertised bust in productivity  Installation was quick and easy 
great on computer and ipad  on iphone remote a little difficult but it worked well
I go to Maine once a year to go fishing  ATT has zero service wher we go  The Verizon Jetpack  hotspot worked floorlessly for five days with four people on it  It said it could hold fifteen  Imdont doubt it  I kept it plugged in much of the time but when we went to dinner it worked off battery   just as well 
I have an late 2011 MBP i7 chip that came with the factory installed 4MB of ram  Over the last few year the operating speed was slowing down so I upgraded to the 8MB ram to improve performance and to allow me to upgrade to MacOS High Sierra 
works as advertised  no complaints  would recommend
I replaced this 2 times on tried it on 2 laptops pairing with a NETGEAR router  Did not get the top speeds that a cheap USB adapter provided 
Unfortunately the memory did not work  After I installed it I turned the computer on and it wouldn t boot up  it just gave me a long beep every five seconds or so  I had to return the memory 
I purchased this item to be able to use as a hands free device when making or receiving phone calls  however  the person couldn t hear me clearly  I chose to return this device because the feature  I would have used most  didn t work well  For this reason I deducted two stars  In terms of the sound quality for the bluetooth speaker   this has a reasonable sound 
Could not program the radio as directed  nor would it receive signals from NOAA for any weather information  Returned it to the store 
This product did not do what we needed  When calling in  they told me that in order to do what we needed  we would have to buy the  299 version  instead of the  99 version 
The guy installing my system did not like this brand so I returned it 
Returned this item due to amt of extension available
Have you ever noticed how a manufacturer can add embellishments to a beautiffuly designed product only to make the new and improved model more clumsy and and less efficient Well  that s exactly what has happened here  As an owner of the previous Harmony One  the remote without Ultimate in its name  I would have rated that model 5 stars  It sported several additional buttons to handle specific functions  and the buttons were larger  with different shapes and feel  and they were well laid out  The remote was a bit larger and heavier  but oh what a pleasure to use  whether with the built in backlighting or simply by feel  The Ultimate One by comparison has fewer buttons  thereby necessitating that some of them perform two completely different functions  a short press will perform a channel up or channel down function and a long press will move up or down one page of the on screen channel guide  You ll be surprised and thoroughly annoyed by how many times you will perform one of those functions when you really meant to perform the other  In addition the buttons are tiny and pretty much the same size and shape  making it very easy to hit the wrong one  Case in point  the tiny mute button lives right below the Volume Down button  I d like to have a dollar for every time my finger inadvertently hit mute when I was trying to reduce the volume of sound  I suppose the remote is called Ultimate because it is capable of responding to gestures similar to a computer tablet  The function is nice  but nowhere as efficient as a good set of buttons The software used to set up the remote is not easy  especially for first time users  If you have previous experience with setting up and using home theater equipment as well as computers you should be able to navigate the software  though not easily  If you lack experience with that equipment you d probably be better of having someone set up the remote for you  Having said all this  I would be remiss if I didn t say that this remote  despite its serious shortcomings is hands down better than the 3 or 4 remotes you would have to use to control a good home theater system  We can only hope that with the next Logitech model  the company will learn from its successes and failures and return to a design similar to the Harmony One 
Increased desktop memory from 16gb to 32 gb  can t go wrong with memory size increase  No issues  very happy with this PNY memory
I waited a good half hour for a salesman but it is ok due to fact my salesman was the best  I watched him with lady before me  even tho he knee I was waiting he did not rush her  and very informative and I want a salesman like that  So I waited for only him as I heard the other salesman say to his customer when I said when your finished I can use help the people said he ca n help me as they wanted to grouse but he rudely said first come first serve  so I knew he wasn t my guy   then I watched the next salesman and I knew he was my speed  I patiently waited maybe even 35 min but he gave me all his time he was so smart and very very patient and didn t push me or rush me he is amazing  So I bought my computer   plus   I will ask for him in future purchases which will be many    and I love my computer it s fast storage great it s simply the best  And this Best Buy Appleton Store stands above others  I am a dedicated shopper here   
Sony has always been good to me  Great little speaker with clear and concise sound 
Built for the NAS small server environment  and does what it is supposed to do dependably 
More than satisfied with this computer from Dell  The unit came with the Intel Core I7 processor and 16 GB of Ram which can handle anything I can throw at it  Also came with a AMD Radeon RX 560 graphics card which more than supports what I would use it for I did open the case and proceed to add 2 more older hard drives  The unit came with a 1TB hard drive and the 2 extra internal hard drives gave me another 1 75 TB of memory for storing my pictures  music and digital DVDs The unit also comes with lots of USB 3 0 ports   4 in the front for easy access and 3 in the back  For future use  the unit also came with one USB 3 1 Type C and one USB 3 1 Type A ports So far the unit has met all my expectations  The unit is also quiet  I also went to the Dell support site and stress tested the unit with their test applications   everything passed This is a great computer for a person like myself who likes to collect family photos  music and digitize my store bought DVDs  In addition  I need lots of memory for my genealogy research which requires digital clippings  PDFs  maps and of course more pictures 
This desk top is absolutely amazing    not only fast and ton of memory with amazing screen display and vibrate colors it s just well worth the money  And once added printer and speakers you can t go wrong it s the Lexus of computers   
I was very excited to have the opportunity to get this computer  as my main desktop is 7 years old  and showing its age  I had just decided that I finally needed a replacement  This computer is a very wonderful and welcome upgrade  The tower is designed to be smaller than the standard desktop size  which makes it easier to find a place for it  I like the silver styling on the front panel very much  This computer has a tool less design  which means that you can access the internal components without having to use any additional tools  I always wanted that feature in my next computer  because trying access the internal components on my old one was always a pain  This computer has about 11 USB ports  which is another plus because I have a ton of USB peripherals  In addition  most of the ports on the computer are the Super Speed USB 3 0 ports  which mean that I can use faster flash drives and peripherals  They even threw in a USB C port  although it is only one There are audio ports on both the front and the back  and this computer comes with WaveMaxx audio support  which makes external speakers sound wonderful  There is a single DVD RW drive  so you can read and write CDs and DVDs  There is an SD card reader on the front as well  The fan system on this computer is excellent  I have not had anything happen that caused me to notice the fans kicking in in high gear The other hardware features this computer has is a whopping 16GB of RAM  a 1 TB 7200 RPM hard drive  Bluetooth 4 0 and Wireless AC  both Intel HD Graphics 630 and an AMD Radeon RX 560 with 2GB of dedicated DDR5 RAM  and the lovely seventh generation Intel Core i7 7700 processor at 3 60 Ghz  The processor shows up as eight processors in the Device Manager  so this is one powerful computer The modest games that I have run  osu   DC Universe Online  Team Fortress  Minecraft  all ran without a breeze  The only issue that I had was due to me not using the correct graphics card  This computer has both integrated and dedicated graphics  and the HDMI connection that is the most obvious one is the integrated one  so I accidentally connected my monitor to the integrated graphics card by mistake  The integrated graphics port should have been covered on my unit  but it was not  So when I started gaming and had some display issues  I was surprised until I checked the manual online and realized my mistake  Still  the integrated card did run the games admirably  but nowhere near as well as the Radeon card The computer comes with a decent keyboard and mouse  The keyboard has media shortcuts and is in a chiclet style  and the mouse actually has a built in DPI switcher  Both are wired  The computer ships with Windows 10 Home This computer has been a blast to use for the past few days  I have not gotten around to use all of the features  but what I have tried so far has been amazing  Also the warranty that comes with it is great  Onsite service after remote diagnosis  The service and support for the XPS line has always been great from Dell  I would definitely recommend this computer to someone who wants to be able to have a powerful machine with great features and gaming ability at a decent price 
My Review Summary sez it all  This speaker is being used in a  humidity high temperature high  workout gym as a single element  Its output fills the area with clear quality sound at higher than normal volume levels    and its built in the USA in Baltimore  MD 
Manual is small and is written in  Chinglish   which is ok because I get a kick out of reading it  This thing sounds great and looks good  It says 2500 watts  which is why i bought it   but it lists 30  15 and 15 per speaker  Not sure how that works  but the sound is impressive  the bluetooth works fine  it looks great and appears to be good quality  Very happy so far 
I m sooo tired of the local radio stations I had to go back to satellite radio  My drive to work is much more better than before 
This is my second Logitech Harmony remote  I had my first one for eight years and loved it I HATE this remote   Yes hate Honestly  I don t even think it should be in the same category as my old Harmony remote  This version is a significant downgrade  The buttons have far less customization  the our old remote  The layout of the buttons on the remote lack a comfortable feel and placement  The removal of the number buttons in favor of the touch screen might not seem like a big deal  But instead of being about to press in 300 for your favorite channel you now need to  Touch the Screen Swipe to unlock If it doesn t come up to the number screen you have to flip through the screens to find the numbers Then enter the 300Who at Logitech thought doubling the number of keystrokes needed made any sense at all I certainly don t I will say  this remote does eliminate the need for multiple remotes  But the downsides of this remote really don t make me happy about the amount of money that it cost 
Got it as a gift for Valentine s Day  Babe loved it  50 cheaper than Best Buy 
I was looking for some outdoor speakers and was leaning toward Bose 251 until I heard these Def Techs  They are a little higher in price than the Bose but the sound quality is excellent  I also like the fact that you can paint them any color to match what they are mounted on  Installation was very simple with the provide mounting brackets as it took about 10 minutes to mount both after the wiring was ran I listen to several different CD today on them all of them were spectacular  Vocals  bass  string instruments were all crisp and clear  I m planning on buying another pair for my shop they sound so good 
I am not a big fan of Sony products  But this has a decent sound  Good for a medium sized room  Quality is very clear not muffled  Extra bass feature lowers the sound significantly 
It s very nice  but for 200  dollars it could be a little louder
I think this is a fine TV at a great price  First off the speakers are terrible  so I bought a sound bar 2 1 simple and cheap  also Samsung  It really helped and changed how tinny the sound was  Second the smart tv component does not like to stay connected wirelessly to the internet  So each time I turn the TV on I head over to the internet connection and make the connection again  My old Roku was more more stable holding a wireless connection  All in all this is a fine small room TV  not high end  but what I needed 
I bought these to replace the speakers in my daughter s Cobalt  The price was reasonable for a trusted name in speakers  My only complaint was not being told I needed a harness adapter to install them which resulted in an extra trip back to the store  I am not a professional installer yet was able to put these in myself after watching how to do it on YouTube   
Bought this speaker to replace my jbl    Didn t want to spend so much at first  but the best buy associate and I figured this would be the best one for me since I like bass  I love the lights on the speaker  The speaker is not as crisp sounding as my old speaker  but it ll do  I do like the fact that I can skip songs or go back by just pressing the play  pause button 
It has a decent sound for the price  it has a very nice look and it is easy to setup 
Sound quality is really pretty decent  We purchased this for dorm room use  as well as occasional outdoor use and this speaker fits the bill The ability for the app to control the speaker  lighting  is pretty cool Only concern is that the speaker is a bit slippery to hold  so walking around with it or transporting it is a concern as I don t wa t to drop it 
Decent sound  but comfort was a huge issue that eventually resulted in returning this item  More comfort with the Beats headphones  guess that s why they re more expensive 
I have multiple Harmony remotes  My favorite remains my first  the Harmony One  Although more powerful in terms of customization than my Harmony Smart Remote s   it is much more awkward in its button layout 
For me it is a nice remote but touchscreen has been buggy  Button placements a little weird  In all honesty I cannot recommend but it is not the worst remote out there 
Does the job  a bit clunky but other wise fairly user friendly  Make sure if Best Buy sets it up for you they give you the login information to the Logitech app  site to sync the remote  Otherwise if you create your own account  you will lose all the programming they did and have to do it all over yourself or pay  99 for them to come back and fix it  like I had to do   Works on all my Samsung products  Hue and Sonos 
Nice design  touch screen feature is nice  a little more effort than most remotes to program 
I had seen this advertised quite awhile ago  Finally decided to buy this when we adopted a rescue pup recently  The camera works pretty good  The set up was very  very easy  This fact alone should be a selling point because so often the instructions are too complicated  The camera allows me to watch my pup while I am away on a very simple  easy to install app on my phone  This set up also allows me to speak to him which is a good feature  The two negatives to this camera  and the reason I didn t give it 5 stars all around  is the picture quality is not all that good  Yes  you can see what is basically going on but it is grainy and a bit blurry  Wish it was a sharper image of what my pup is doing  The other negative is that I had to place it into 3 different electrical outlets to get the angle and position that I needed in the room  Each move meant connecting to the internet and going through the whole set up process  There should be some kind of memory for the IP address  This camera should be more portable for other rooms  views  Thanks goodness  as I said  it was an easy setup  I do like it and Home Depot had the best price I have seen  I have not tried the free trial to have the video saved for playback  Still thinking about doing that  I might be purchasing another camera for my daughter s house and her two rescue pups  Worth the price and very glad I bought it 
it works great  the best part is the biometric scanner 
Decent headphones  Sounds good  But if you are buying this for noise canceling  I would recommend Bose which comes at the same price but with a lot better noise cancellation 
Have owned these 3 months and the right side is starting to cut out  I use them about 8 9 hours a day while sitting at desk at work  Other than that issue  they are good headphones 
Sounds good  but not much low range  Solid for the money 
Gets the job done  but could get better quality memory for a comparable price  All in all  not a bad purchase though 
This speaker puts out decent sound  I got it on sale for  39 and it was worth as a speaker for my bedroom  Puts out decent sound when folding laundry or doing other choose in that end of the house 
A bit more complicated than the previous one  but works well 
3rd expensive but works well most of the time  Sometimes it doesn t change all devices property 
I m satisfied  Works as described  Recommend this for purchase
We needed this really bad and decided to buy this brand  It�s got great speed and the distance is decent  The price is not bad at all as well 
This small bookshelf system sound great for the price  The length of the speaker cables allow for you to space out your speaker a good amount  Bluetooth connection is a breeze and radio stations sound clear 
Iv had no problems with this RAM  It works well in my rig 
PNY   Anarchy 2 Pack 8GB is perfect for your gaming or workstaion pc   i have 36GB in my current gaming pc and its super fast
Excellent product for college student and high school kids
Since I don t have cable and use an XBox 360  plus a sound bar  watching TV used to be a three remote affair  with all three having to be out if I wanted to change shows  change the volume  or power off any given device  I looked up universal remotes  and although a bit pricey  the Harmony One supported all my devices  and allowed me to program functionality on all of my devices into a single activity that I call  Watch TV   Now when I hit the  Watch TV  icon on the little LED screen  the TV  sound bar  and XBox all turn on at the same time  on the settings I would need to watch my shows  Furthermore  I don t need to switch to  modes  when using different devices  each button can be programmed to activate a device s function independent of the other devices in the chain  It is so massively convenient that even my tech illerate mom could figure it out without any instruction from me 
needed something to make an I pad loader to teach a dance class
These are cute lightweight headphones that are inexpensive but sound good  However  I find they hurt my ears over time  so I am constantly adjusting them on my head  I bought them on sale to try this style of headphone and although I do feel I got a bit more than what I paid for  I wonder if I should have gotten a higher end pair 
Went for the this model because of active noise canceling and wireless features and past experience with Bose products  Found Bose App to be limited and cumbersome  Not very intuitive  Sound canceling not as effective as expected 
There is no way to manage the features of this headset because the app doesn t work and hasn t been fixed for months  Here s the full story  At the Best Buy store  the JBL rep bragged about all the cool features and technology included  and how you control it via an app on your phone  I purchased the headphones but upon setup I discovered that the App gets stuck with a  Please connect headphones  screen  I tried both bluetooth and wired connections  I cleared app data and uninstalled  reinstalled  Nothing helped  On the App Store there are over 200 1 star reviews dating back months complaining about this same issue  How can JBL leave such a major issue unresolved for months? Without the app you can t turn on noise cancelling or any of the features  JBL  you should do better than that 
I bought this to replace my old Sony system  I also bought a Sony STRD H550 receiver to go with it  The speaker system is very easy to set up  You have to purchase wall mounting brackets separately for the surround speakers 
i bought this started 5 1 surround setup to go with my new Yamaha 5 1 receiver  definitely not disappointed  They work perfectly for my smaller TV room and the bass is amazing on the subwoofer  Can t believe these were only  150  cheaper than a single speaker in most cases 
So many portable speakers use bass instead of quality to deceive listeners  Not this Sony  It is vrisp  not muddled  and loud 
The sound has a crisp  unique and great sound  It has a loud sound  The base is not as loud as a braven 
Really crisp and clear sounding speakers  Had to turn my treble down they were so clear 
Replaced my outdoor speakers Was a nice upgrade  Sound great Nice and clear 
My Harmony 900 died and I needed a replacement  My one requirement was that it work with a FireTV  This said it did but after several attempts I packaged it back up and sent it back  I actually ended up purchasing the 100 version which doesn t have a screen and you can control with your smartphone and alexa  I don t use the smartphone controller very often but love the alexa integration    Alexa Turn on the Fire TV
Unboxed it and got it connected to wifi pretty easily using WPS  Tried installing the software on one computer  but it froze up after installing and running  Tried installing on another computer and got a little further   it did see the Slingbox on the network  I got about halfway into configuring it but it hung up at the point where it was trying to configure the remote  Uninstalled the software  did a hard reset on the Slingbox  reconnected it to the wifi  tried again and it hung up in the same spot  Tried installing the Sligbox app on my Android tablet  thinking that might get further    alas  you can t configure the slingbox that way   you can only use it once it s already configured  At that point  I d spent an hour of my life on this silly thing so I gave up and returned it 
Glad you carry them couldnt fine these anywhere else
Six months ago my FH and I bought a Panasonic Viera 58  LCD TV  We also bought this wall mount to hold it up  We happily took it home  set it up  and for six months  enjoyed the TV without a care in the world    Until this morning  We were in the kitchen making breakfast when we heard a crash from the living room  and ran in to find the wall mount had FALLEN OUT OF THE WALL  I double checked that we had had it in studs with our stud finder  just like I did when I installed it   and found that the back panel had bent up  When I lifted the tv to move it  i saw that it was COVERED in spiderweb cracks  I am so  so  upset right now  This piece of trash has cost me ~1200  or more to get a new tv 
I ve been purchasing Sony shelf systems for a bit over 20 years now  and by far this is the best one to date  I listen to a lot of different genres of music and being a mobile DJ I have a huge library  I tested out the system with many types of genres and it never disappointed  Even at high volumes the system maintain clarity and the bass was also very clear and solid not punchy or muddy  I ve seen that other reviews stated that the sound was terrible  I don t know what system they were listening to but it sure wasn t this one  When it comes to audio equipment I consider myself to be picky but I am extremely pleased with the sound that this system produces  They did not have a display unit at the store I purchased it at so when I got home the subwoofer was a little bigger than I anticipated  which was a good thing  If you love and enjoy rich deep bass with plenty of clarity then this is the system for you 
I could never touch it correctly  I m not sure what it was  but it seemed my fingers might have been too big  One time I could press on the screen  and it wouldn t work  The next time I would just pass my finger over  not touching   and it would take me somewhere I didn t want to go  Then I couldn t find out how to get back  I guess I just need buttons 
I downloaded the 90 MB driver file but I could not get the wireless working with this mouse so I am using it with the wired connection  Have to be careful not to touch side buttons because of unintended response  It lights up nice and could be fun for gamers  but I just wanted a good mouse  I did not really need all the lights   no whistles    
Absolutely could not get a signal anywhere inside or outside of my house  Radio seemed to be fine  but just could not connect  Which is funny  because the car can still receive when it is almost all the way inside the garage  Sent it back
This is not a Bluetooth device so your phone has to be manually connected  disconnected each time you enter   leave your car  Perhaps this helps with better sound quality  Also I cannot choose a previous track when pressing the rewind button  It only allows me to rewind the song that I am currently playing  When I return to my car and was playing a podcast  the Alpine unit does not recognize where I left off unless I speak the command to  resume podcast   Also the speaker does not work well as installed by bestbuy  adjacent to the rear view mirror   when driving in my car at speeds greater than 40 mph because it picks up background noise  Disappointed by this unit  Would wait for 2nd or 3rd generation 
Like the remote  but eh touch screen does not always respond  and gaining access to the bottom activity is sometimes difficult  I prefer the old style where you have buttons on the side of screen much better or the large screen of the 1100 
Sounds good    not  300 good  the speaker is the same as a Mega Boom with Alexa  but doesn�t have all the features  Missing the equalizer  Smart Bluetooth  Party Up  linking other speakers and the Tap features  Unless you absolutely need Alexa  just get a Mega Boom 
These two packs of 4GB memories each works very well  and makes my notebook run with less swap  I like this memory 
This 8GB memory kit is designed for Apple� iMac�  MacBook� and MacBook Pro and features up to 1 0GHz operating speed for easy Web browsing and efficient operation it was really easy to install  great product 
I was a bit skeptical about this purchase due to some user reviews  I bought it as a gift and set it up for him  The setup took a little time but not too difficult  once it was working I was impressed  Pretty awesome  the screen looks very nice and the backlit keys are nice  Fits nicely in hand  One thing to think about is looking down at the screen  most remotes can be operated by feel without looking  the nice display requires a glance down to see what to press  However you can still use the physical buttons as well for most functions if you don t always want to use the screen  An impressive remote that I would recommend to friends tired of a mess of remotes for all their devices 
Was easy to install and operates really really well
Worth every penny  Great little speaker for only a hundred bucks  Plus the lights at night look kind of cool   
The idea with this remote is pretty cool  However  with so much competition and smart phone apps I think Logitech needs to rethink the price point  The design and feel of this remote is pretty nice  But after fiddling with it for over a week I cannot get it to work properly  Checked with tech support and then trying to update the firmware did not seem to help  I even got one of the tech support to admit they knew there was a firmware issue with their touchscreen remotes  Maybe he ll fix that with the next firmware 
This keyboard has fingertip recognition  Works really well  I wish it could record more than one finger tip though 
Nice keyboard with fingerprint reading  Does not always work but could be due to Windows 10 
I like the device  it s great  Has options on tfhe screen  It replaced the wifi in my store  Though Verizon slows your data after 10gbs
Having just bought a new 55  QLED Samsung a few weeks ago for myself   now it was time to hand some cool HD vision to my Bro  who needed an update after a  cool then    27  Toshiba CRT  I m VERY familiar with all the Samsung products    had no hesitation of what I wanted to buy  but more a simple decision on the size   my Bro had no need for 4K  but we did compare the HD vision of the Samsung products to the 32 36  variants    decided on the 40  HD   PIC is RAZOR    the SMART addition to the HD was something the Bro had no idea about    yet  has been tickled pink since he received his HD  Easy setup   easy use of remote   and overall a VERY COOL deal from Best Buy   as always   
it controls everything  I gots nest  Phillips and other smart devices its nice to be able to control with my remote control 
The is a really cool portable phone charger  All you have to do is charge it at home before you leave and when you are out and need to charge your phone just hook it up and it works perfectly
i like how i can connect or disconnect the keyboard  its not in the way and fits just right 
We had a Verizon home wifi unit we used for home and travel  Once the contract expired  I wanted a hotspot easier to take on the road  This unit has been excellent  The performance has been very good  it is easy to connect devices to it  An added bonus  it alerts me every time a new device connects which will make it easy to prevent unauthorized use  I also have the ability to set preferences on the internet  The battery life is also very good 
These are fine headphones for the money  The odd part is that the designer decided to use a proprietary charging cord instead of a standard like micro USB  I fear that if the cord gets damaged or lost  it will be difficult to replace 
this remote makes it convenient to have everything controlled with just the one remote   however  it s a little confusing but we are still getting used to it
I bought it for convenience but it so smooth that i love it 
This keyboard comes in hand when you just don t want to type on the screen  I highly recommend the Touch ID too 
I love this remote  You have to realize that their is a lot of back end work to make this work  It is not simple plug and play  You have to connect to a computer as well  Be patient because if you are  WOW    This remote will change your life  My wife loves it  It makes her life simpler and I get a cool gadget  Advice though  Make sure you have all your model numbers  Hopefully it s not buried deep in the shelf 
Plan for the future and get the Ultimate Home version instead  especially if you see yourself putting your components in a cabinet  Also  consider the possibilities of home automation  I returned this and went with the home version  Now I have my Nest thermostats at my fingertips and I can control everything with iPad and iPhone also 
Less than 24 hours after receiving TV  it went out   no picture but sound worked  Called Samsung and after repairman came out  the motherboard has to be replaced     Already   Unbelievable  How are your products made Samsung Pretty pitiful  Good news is they are repairing it for free  bad news is the wait 
I bought this for the wi fi feature  hoping to connect it to my Airplay network  Looks like it doesn t have an airplay option  only songpal  which is a little bit iffy  Would love to get it to work as an airplay device  Anyone know how?
In order to work you need component cables  not HDMI  My cable box only has HDMI 
The device works however the connection can just randomly drop  Also the devices usb cable must be in a very tight port or will drop connection  I wouldn�t recommend but it will do in a pinch 
Nice design and quality  Somewhat confusing controls 
Bought this for my 84 year old mother in Florida  We had problems with programming and even bigger problems with scheduling the Geek Squad
I thought the start up and application speed would dramatically change since I added 16 GB of the PNY DDR4 memory to the 8 GB that came with my Lenovo computer  I am sure it is faster but not that noticeable 
Was looking to replace older computer  This is just what I needed and at a great price 
I bought this to have a Bluetooth signal on my desktop computer and I live in a motorhome next to my daughters house This sends bluetooth signal very well I have everything connected now Great Product and a fair price 
 Age  32 Tech savvy Sound is good but the controls on the unit are not intuitive at all  Customers just need FM radio and Bluetooth  give me a display and two simple buttons    but they cram 100 tiny buttons on the unit  requiring you to press several  in random sequence  it seems  to switch inputs  The display and layout on all of these after market car  boat units has not advanced much from the units of the 90s  pixel ly  cheesy techno looking  with weird abbreviations for all the messages it tries to display   I was hoping that with this being released Summer 2016  the Sony engineers would have modernized it  Maybe in another 10 years     
This device  in theory  is great  But way too complicated to operate  especially in the dark  Yes  three our four remotes   pain in the butt  but they get the job done for me much easier  AND I don t know if it s the fault of this device  but for some reason  out of the blue  Crackle takes over the tv and I end up going to the Sony remote to get back to watching my show two words    too complicated 
Finally no more cracked speakers in my car  I bought both front and rear speakers to go with my new stereo system and they sound amazing 
compliments my restroom and living room system  love it
If you re looking for a complete hands on review of the Logitech Harmony Ultimate One then look no further P S    This review was made for the Jerry Neutron YouTube channel  Feel free to subscribe  
Okay  semi expert here  This is my fourth Harmony universal remote in about ten years  Perhaps that leads to conclusions about issues of longevity I m a little torn on that  Yes  they do get daily work  but a little more in the build quality  especially for the steep price  seems warranted  Battery life on the previous models was also not good   I am talking about rechargeable models Sadly  nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech  Harmony  If I am wrong please tell me in the comments   I am willing to switch While easy to use  easy to set up is not the same thing  If you are tech savvy  it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first  getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear  second  knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs  Advice  write it down and keep it on file  That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge  Unlike my last model  the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off  I had to customize button settings for my cable box  FIOS  to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand   that s right  no default button set up for On Demand  In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away  but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need  Back to cable  but some often used functions  like search  are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote  We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer  but again  for 250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing  Not to be AV elitist  but I don t think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out 250 for a remote  We want ease of use  but also versatility  FYI  I am running this with a HD TV  audio video receiver and a 5 1 surround setup  FIOS cable box  Roku 4  blueray DVD player and  for old family stuff I am working to convert  an actual VHS VCR P S  Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful   volume buttons are easier to use  Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality  Form factor  ergonomics is not the best either  Volume  channel  guide   highly used buttons not in a natural position for the hand  Hire a real Human Factors person please 
Smaller than model that was being replaced  Setup was very easy  Can be set so as to get only alerts for local area
I enjoy the sound quality that this system has  I ve purchased other Yamaha speakers and the durability and sound quality seems to be matching those from 12  years ago  I would purchase these again if needed a small system 
Excellent compact camera backpack  Has storage for DSLR  extra lens  digital camera  GoPro and tripod  Extremely compact and airline carry on size 
This is by far the best mini surge protector  charger I ve owned  Charging my devices on the go is really easy and the backup battery is ideal for taking boosting my mobile devices far away from an outlet 
It ll slide in any pocket and come in handy whenever I need to power my mobile devices 
The m2 model is nice and compact to tuck away in our entertainment console
Should have bought Hub with remote  Need more explanation on site to explain how to use install with hub 
comfortable  but noise cancelation is not as good 
These headphones are comfortable  stylish  and slightly cheap  Expect the white version of the headphones to show wear and tear within weeks  but still work effectively  If you plan on shoving these into a bag a lot  you may want to consider a different product  Even the included carrying case does not truly fit the headphones  With that said  the headphones work fantastically and do have noise reduction settings  Please note the microphones are on the back of the headphones Anyone complaining on buzzes or odd noises most likely has those microphones covered  I noticed the slight feedback from these microphones while laying a couch and having the headphones pushed into the couch headrest  Still a great buy 
I love these universal remotes  The Only downside is the range  I thought by now they would be able to be further away from the tv and work fine 
Covers the ear without the vacuum created by other models excellent sound 
I tried many head phones before deciding on the over the ear JBL Everest Elite 700 wireless headphones  The sound quality and noise cancelling is as good as any of the other brands I�ve tried in this price range  Even without using the noise cancelling the over the ear cups provide good sound insulation  To top it off they are comfortable headphones

I found these JBL over the ear headset to be very comfortable and filled with rich sound  I am pleased to have purchased and would recommend to others as a good buy  It was very affordable as well 
Good price   quick delivery   good sound   comfortable   easy to connect devices  Would buy again   hope they last 
IVery comfortable  stylish and functional  This is the second time I m buying a camera bag  The one I got last time was also by Lowepro  but it was not half that usefull and almost twice more expensive  Velcro dividers work perfectly  but i still wish there was more of them  Bottom line   Great  inexpensive convenient roomy and stylish camera bag 
This mouse delivers just what I need   comfort  accuracy  and it s rechargeable  I did not want a mouse that would depend on having extra batteries on hand to swap out  The lights are a nice bonus  too   as is the fact that I can change them or turn them off as desired It s very configurable  with the ability to add extra weight  change the tracking speed  the polling frequency  and  as mentioned  the lighting options Build quality is very solid  and the braided cable feels very durable  It s great that it supports charging while in use  and it charges very quickly while doing so  The software  not included   downloaded from the web address listed in the setup guide  is very thorough and gives you full control Glad I bought it  and I highly recommend it 
Great way to combine all remotes in the house  Have very easy setup via computer 
the touch screen to change channels when watching TV is frustrating  Also you have to leave the device pointed directly at the TV  cable box and dvd or it may only partially follow your commandDisappointing for  250
Sigh  I have an old Harmony that had some buttons which were no longer working  so I decided to by the newer model  To make a long story short  the cloud based system that they use has been revamped  It should have been a simple process to log into my old account and copy my settings from the old remote to the new one  Instead I had to create a new account and copy settings from the old account  This took me a couple of tries  my fault  and because I couldn t delete an existing remote from the system I actually had to create two new accounts to get everything set up right  Not to mention the new system is based on silverlight and crashed on my Mac the first time I tried to set up the remote As to the remote itself  it works just like my older one  The only difference appears to be the battery life  which is much shorter than my old one  They mention that you should put the remote in the charger when you re not using it  I can see why 
Advanced remote  All in one  good connection but hard to use for elderly clients
This remote is so freaking awesome  we love it  Its like the click remote on the movie Click  What doesn t it do?
Easy to install  great value  envy of the neighborhood patios Key here is a great amp and 14 gauge speaker wire if runs are longer the 8 feet UPS damage to exterior of boxes but packaging was excellent and speaks were in tact and flawless 
Easy to set upGood clear sound and volume control
Speakers sound very clear and are loud but if your looking for something that has bass then these are not the right choice as I have found out  Otherwise speakers are loud and are very crisp sounding  Would sound great if you had subs in the trunk 
Love this speaker  I hooked it to my iPad and phone 
Replaced factory speakers on my Ford F150 and it sounds much better  Just need to add at least small subwoofer for more bass 
The picture is so clear  when I�m alone watching tv I start to talk to people like they�re in my living room  This tv has made me feel like i have friends again  I strongly urge everyone to buy this tv 
The headphones offer exceptional clear and accurate sound  The over the ear design isolates your listening environment  Very comfortable for long periods of use 
Alpine speakers are great  the sound is clear and installation was easy 
Already own a Sony blue tooth speaker so that s why I thought it would be the perfect gift as a housewarming gift for a friend who has a pool and needed some sound on their patio
I prefer a clean  full and powerful sound  JBL has always delivered and I ve tried many different brands  The Bluetooth is very convenient  The sound is balanced  I even heard voices and layers in music that I haven t heard before after the first time I used them  The app is nice as well  I like having certain eq settings for my particular genres of music  I m very satisfied so far 
I m a fan of all Harmon Kardon products  This is my second pair of jbl headphones  first pair are 8 years old  wired AND still kicking  and I absolutely love the sound quality  clarity and balance  These qualities are important to me because I m a musician and music arranger  With products like this  I m able to do my job more effectively  Having the Bluetooth feature is a huge plus so I m not limited in one space  The noise cancellation   ambient sound feature is nice too  It ll allow you to either ignore or be aware of your surroundings  I strongly recommend JBL  infinity  and Harmon Kardon products for your music listening experience 
Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband  He is hard to buy for  He really likes these said they are comfortable to wear and sound great 
The Sling box is great  It offers the perfect way to enjoy your television from another location  It is a great money saver 
I bought a MacBook Pro in 2012 and from the get go  the computer was painfully slow  The dread beach all appeared if I had more than a few things open and opening most apps took minutes Numerous visits to the Apple Store had me turning up empty handed  I was about to write off Apple completely as my MacBook has next to nothing on it and that performance was unacceptable  I saw this on sale and thought I�d give it a go  My computer came with 4GB from the factory  Wow  Night and day  The computer is fast  responsive  and like brand new  Before you spend the money upgrading to an SSD drive  try upgrading your RAM  It took maybe five minutes and I wish I would have done this years ago 
It s hard to do a perfect review on a hard drive  because one of the most important things is how well they store your data over time  You can t magically peek into the future and see whether these things will or won t die or give you problems along the way  so I ll try to keep it down to what I do know This 3TB Toshiba drive replaced a 2TB Seagate that started having I  O errors when reading a small bit of data  Not wanting to risk waiting to see if that small error would become a bigger problem  I ordered this drive and had it shipped to me  which was processed and delivered faster than expected  Props to Best Buy and UPS for that As for the drive itself  it has a three year warranty  but being larger than 2TB you ll have to format it using GPT rather than the old MBR standard  otherwise you won t be getting the full amount of space on the drive  Formatting will take a few hours  so after installing the drive don t expect to have it raring to go immediately Speaking of installing  this is a bare bones  no frills hard drive despite being in a retail box    inside the cardboard you ll find a lot of foam padding to keep the drive protected  the drive itself within a protective bag  and a little warranty paper  but NOTHING ELSE  No screws  no cables  no instructions  Since I had extra parts and was familiar with the installation process  this was not a problem for me  but this drive is not a great choice for novices who have never poked around a computer s insides before All said and done though  this Toshiba drive is doing its job  and seems to be a little faster and snappier than the old one it replaced  I can t really complain  and it has chugged along pretty much 24  7 in the several days its been since I got it  I did install a separate heatsink  fan to the bottom of the unit as well  just to help make sure that it wouldn t overheat  especially in this sweltering summer heat  So far though  it s been smooth sailing 
This is a cheap tv and not worth your money  TV remote is a joke and tv is thick for a recent tv
Not Dell s best effort  The whole thing feels cheap 
Love it   Works great  who needs a CD player these days 
After reading the reviews I decided to buy the charger  On a full charge it only charged my phone 41% before running out  I was definitely not satisfied 
The charger is such a low wattage that it fails to charge my Lenovo Thinkpad  despite the website saying it supported this type of computer 
Charges fast Works better if phone is in airplane mode
After a few months  my slingbox stopped recognizing my Chromecast v  2  The cast icon stopped showing in the slingplayer app  for Android  even though it shows and works fine in every other app I have that casts  I opened a ticket in May and was told that it was escalated  I was never contacted  though I was eventually told that the ticket was closed and that they tried to reach me but couldn t  This is impossible since I am on call  Of course  there is no resolution available based on that ticket  A new ticket was opened  and almost a month later  there is still no information  All I get is a runaround including repeatedly telling me that I emailed them that the problem was resolved because I emailed that a different problem with a different ticket was resolved 
Available in store at a good price  It is getting harder and harder to find these  Best Buy came thru
I wanted CarPlay functionality in my 2000 VW beetle and have been looking for a good deal on a media receiver  I stumbled upon an open box special at Best Buy and picked up an Alpine ILX 007 ProsSmall light chassis  Makes fitting in tight places a breezeQuick connectivityAmazing sound from built in ampCarPlayConsTouch screen Volume buttons are a bit finicky  I prefer a knob or hard buttons Screen washes out in sunlight  It s still visible but could be improved on While the sound is excellent it has minimal audio adjustments compared to a Kenwood or Pioneer Overall I m very satisfied and appreciate the manufacturers bringing CarPlay and other media connectivity to Thise who don t want to part with our older cars 
Bought this for my Honda Civic  Absolutely love it  If you own an iPhone it is so simple to use
The Best Buy technician installed the speaker in a timely fashion and the speakers sound great 
Can t tell you how much we love using this remote with our admittedly complex home theater setup  Super easy to see what you re about to select  Really like that you can fix the activity from the screen instead of having to grab remotes or pulling up the smartphone interface 
difficult to use
I still own the very first SlingBox and it still works today  but its not HD  I am a big fan of the technology This new one works well  but the Windows applications to support it are buggy and need more work  The Android and Web interface work OK  but if you leave the SlingBox app running in the background on your Android phone it will suck your battery dry Other then those few complaints I love my SlingBox 
I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT THE P5s BEING CHEAP  ONCE I HEARD THE CLARITY OF THEM I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS CHEATING MYSELF INSTEAD OF SAVING THE MONEY  I DROVE PAST 2 BESTBUYS THAT DIDN T HAVE THEM JUST TO GET THEM THE SAME DAY I RETURNED THE P5s IN VALLEY STREAMS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE P7s  I HAVE LISTENED TO THRILLER FOR 25 YEARS  BUT I HEARD THINGS IN THE BACKGROUND THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE WEARING THE P7s 
I ve never had a bad experience with Alpine  These sound great  I would buy these again  Put these in my last truck  doors  
This is our 3rd Samsung  Very pleased with it You will be too 
My newer model Samsung TV isn t listed in the software and the alternate method of forcing a fit don t seem to work  I am very disappointed  Waiting for a while to see if they ever update the software to include my model If and when i can get it to work on my system I may re rate this product 
The program downloading process was simple  but the remote has yet to work  It can turn on and off the devices  but I can t get it to change channels on the tv  I am awaiting a member of the Geek Squad to fix it 
This is one of the best purchases we made  We didn t even know about this remote but our salesman suggested it and we just love 1 remote 
Already owned one of these for the family room and liked it so much that I bought this one for the bedroom  Great product 
The features and quality are more than i expected for the price  Dont think twice if you are considering this unit
Quality picture and easy to put together  Has the pedestal stand which is important 
I d really like this much better without the trackpad
it is a good product  sometime when pressing a channel button it does not recognize the proper channel  this is frustrating  but it is nice to have all devices one device 
I purchased this camera so that I can watch my cat when I am away from home on weekend get a ways  The camera works with an app  called Hubble for Motorola that can be downloaded from the app store  I am somewhat satisfied with the camera due to its notification settings and ability to detect temperature changes and sounds  but unfortunately if I would have known about the plan that is required to utilize some features after the trial period  I would have gone with a different product I ll start with some features about the camera that I enjoyed  I really like the fact that you can control the notifications to include things such as a preset temperature change  sound detection  and motion detection  I currently have mine set up to notify me of any movement near the camera  so I receive frequent notifications of any movement on my device  The camera can record a live stream or an action shot that is then stored on the app s cloud to be accessed at your convenience  I also like the fact that there is only a few second delay with the live feed  and the two way communication with the microphone is a really good aspect Unfortunately  there were only two major things that I didn t like about the camera  After a period of 2 3 weeks  the camera is still a live stream video feed  but the motion triggered recording that I was previously enjoying is now only available by enrolling in a monthly plan  Essentially  now I am only getting notifications that include a photo of the motion that triggered the camera  Since my free trial expired  I am now only receiving pictures of my cat  instead of the recorded video  When I go to upgrade my plan  I discover that 30 days of the product features I was previously enjoying would cost me an additional 29 Read more

Great bag  Plenty of room for DSLR camera and extra lens 
I basically live at my girlfriends house but she doesnt have cable  As a big sports fan  I needed cable for specific channels that arent available through streaming apps such as NBC Sports  Fox Sports Go  or even Sling TV s a la carte packages  although they have lot to offer for monthly subscriptions less than what cable companies charge   I connected the slingbox to an extra cable box at my parents house and ive been able to pick it up through the Fire Stick at my girlfriend s house on the Sling Player app  As long as you have good networking in both locations the stream is pretty darn good  I downloaded the Sling Player app on my phone and I am able to watch TV at work as well  You can bring it anywhere  It is a great solution that has been a game changer 
I love this  It s so great not having six remotes     This is the Best thing I ever bought   
Buy it  I guarantee you will be pleased  I bought a top of the line Harmony in 2013   and really enjoyed it  However  this one blows it away  Buy it 
This is a fantastic speaker  Great build quality and the sound is awesome  Great battery life  The lights built into it are an awesome added bonus  Highly recommended 
This remote does almost everything well  but I have problems using it with my Roku box  Sometimes it randomly will not control the Roku  This is usually after I have watched a video on the Roku for a period of time  Then I try to pause it and nothing happens  No other remote command affects the Roku either  I have to go through the annoying process of switching to a different input  e g  cable TV  and then back to the Roku mode  During this time the Roku video continues  so now I have to rewind a bit to get back to where I was  This is extremely frustrating  and it makes no sense because it s not like the Roku signals change at all  So why would the remote randomly stop sending them But it works fine with all my other devices 
This car is Flawless set it forget it it actually gets further reception through concrete walls than my Ace internal added on card make sure you run the disk first then plug it into your computer and that s it man it doesn t get no better
Has issues with button delays   as in it takes 1 second every time you press the button  Annoying as ALL other remotes are normal Logitech tech support has NOT been good NO amount of tweaking parameters and settings helped  Firmware updates are a long  arduous process with antiquated Java software FIX IT 
Reasonable sound  but terrible latency  When connected by Bluetooth the delay is approximately a half second  Even when it s connected via the audio cable there is a delay  though it s not as bad as Bluetooth  I don t have this problem with  for example  a much cheaper Anker MP141 cube speaker  though the sound quality doesn t compare  
Works as advertised  but I liked my original Harmony remote better  The flat buttons and touch screen mean you have to look at the remote when using it  I liked being able to feel what I was doing on my original Harmony  Also  my charging dock broke after 14 months 
I have had this remote for a couple years  but I can still say I am mostly happy with this remote  It is easy enough to program and use you can program special functions  like when you want to play a blueray  it automatically turns on the TV  Blueray player  and surround sound with a single button There are a couple things that are a pain  Frequent requests for you to update the remote  I usually ignore them  The rechargeable battery life is just OK I do love that I can use my phone since the remote works through your home network though 
This thing bumps  I compared it to Dre Beats Pill and its sounds better for a lot less     I m glad the in store associate pointed me towards it 
This unit is bulky  and I can receive nearly identical up and down transmission speeds with an adapter the size of a laptop mouse dongle  The good part of this adapter is the USB 3 0 connection which will make your WiFi connection snappier than using a USB 2 0 connection  The deal breaker for me was that installing the driver software included with this adapter dramatically increased both the startup and shutdown times of my desktop computer  I hated that  and returned the adapter for that reason 
Me encanta muy buen sonido
to be honost it works nice and the price is great as well
This computer was on clearance with a  125 student discount  so out the door for an insane  625    I still can t believe the price for what I got  these CPU s are  300 plus alone  I am reviewing on a  1000 price  which is still a very good deal If you are getting the blue screen of death when updating windows  the issue may be Dell s driver they use for the onboard WIFI  Just download the newest Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 3165 driver and you will be fine  I would recommend getting a SSD for this computer and using it for booting up your operating system  Once you use a computer with a SSD  it is hard to use a 7200 RPM HD  You can upgrade the video card pretty easily as will  The case is designed for this  However  because of people using video cards to mine  the prices are out of control  Even the RX 560 video card that is comes with is  100 plus these days  If you want to game with this machine the only video card I would upgrade to right now is a NVidia 1060 3 GB model  I am subtracting a star for dealing with WIFI driver issue  but I really think the computer is well built and has decent components  I usually build systems  but for the price I couldn t pass it up

Broken out of the box  This is the 5th item from BB that this has happened 
It s an amazing speaker but only lasted 4 weeks before it broke  Can t return it since it s past the 15 day return policy  Terrible product 
They suck  I haven t been able to use them because one of the speakers is broken  I drive over the road and I haven t been able to bring them back  now I m stuck with them
If you have a lot of remote controls  then you need this  I wore the numbers clean off the buttons on my old  Harmony One  remote so the wife bought me the  Harmony Ultimate One  remote for Christmas  It has a charging cradle  back lit keys and a touch screen  Very nice when watching TV in the dark  Also it was the easiest set up ever  I just had the new remote copy the settings from the old remote and pair it with my Harmony Hub  Ba boom  Done  Love it 
I HAD THE HARMONY ONE FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AND THE TOUCH SCREEN JUST FROZE UP AND WOULD NOT WORK AGAIN WARANTY WAS UP AND LOGITECH WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT  I WANTED TO BUY ANOTHER BUT THEY WERE DISCONTINUED SO I HAD TO BUY THIS HARMONY ULTIMATE ONE REMOTE  VERY DISSATISFIED   I DO NOT LIKE THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE HARD NUMBER BUTTONS ON IT SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN  ALSO ALOT OF TIMES I PUT IT DOWN AND IT SWITCHES ACTIVITIES  WHEN I AM IN MY SMART HUB OCCASIONALLY THE REMOTE SEEMS TO FORGET WHICH ACTIVITY IT IS IN AND SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS DO NOT WORK SO I HAVE TO RESET IT BY STARTING ALL OVER  I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE FIRST REMOTE AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS DISCONTINUED  THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK AND COSTS MORE 
Bought this to upgrade our two year old Macbook  Aluminum   which only had 2GB in it  Easy process  and the laptop felt like a new machine with no more beach ball of death  Great price for a big bump in performance 
This TV has a beautiful color picture quality  The images for Netflix and other apps are visible too 
Everyone in the house loves it  Was breeze to setup  transferred settings from old remote 
I had these for a while and used them occasionally  They now no longer stay unfolded  The plastic mechanism that clicks into place broke from the adjustable plastic piece that slides into the lower headphone bracket  When I open the headphones I have to click the plastic mechanism into place to keep the headphones open  Also  the jack for the headphone cord has a bad connection  This jack is also used for charging  I sometimes lose the sound on the right side after unplugging the cord  I have to insert   remove the cord repeatedly until the sound comes back when using bluetooth 
There aren t many computer speaker systems on the market  as far as I know  where blue tooth technology  an FM radio  USB  Micro SD slots and RCA audio input jacks are incorporated right into the sub woofer allowing you to play music almost anywhere without any other additional equipment or necessary hook ups  With this being said  these were features that attracted me to purchase the BT 210F model I have never heard of Boytone before  It seems like a relatively new brand and there are not many reviews out there regarding the products that they are currently selling  My purchase was made with some trepidation Overall  the unit is really nice looking  The pictures shown for the product give the impression that this set up is much bigger than it really is  The only thing that is big would be the sound  This unit can get pretty loud  especially with the sub woofer I would have given this review five stars if not  for what some people will find  quite annoying  Surprisingly  no one else who has already purchased this model has even mentioned what I am about to describe       Each SOURCE volume for AUX  DVD  USB  SD  FM  BL  Bluetooth  has a preset volume  When you first turn the unit on and scroll to AUX  the volume is preset at AU18  When you scroll to DVD  the preset volume is DU18 and so on Now I am not sure why Boytone decided to design the unit to perform like this but it is somewhat of an inconvenience Example scenario  If you are on AUX first  the master volume defaults at AU18  That is a pretty high setting for starts  especially if you do not first adjust the volume of the computer or other device you are using the speakers for prior to powering up the sub woofer Read more
I was surprised at how well my new MiFi 6620L works  It easily reaches 25 Mbps and I have great signal everywhere I go  except a few spots on my train commute into Washington  D C   Long battery life and solid signal make it a great device for remote work and internet use I strongly recommend the 6620L for anyone who needs a portable internet solution in addition to data sharing on a cell phone plan 
This purchased as a birthday gift for my son  He smiled as he told me how much faster this wireless mouse was compared to his previous wireless mouse 
Got it for a great price before Christmas  and the person that received it says they love it 
Four weeks of frustration trying to set it up  Customer service is only via email and most of their solutions were generic  Gave up returned it  Bought the Harmony 700 at Best Buy its working great 
It did work but realized that I don t need it  Had a family member given me his account wireless and he just rebooted it  So I don t need the one I bought 
Bought at Best Buy  device will not connect using Bluetooth  I have tried two Galaxy S5 s  an iPhone 6  and my laptop  Followed the instructions online since the included instructions are worthless  At best the device only shows up for a couple seconds to pair and always fails  but it takes several tries to get it to show up as a option  Tried using NFC to pair and it fails every time as well  Worked over WiFi without problems  but the Bluetooth seems dead 
I purchased this as a gift for someone but from what I have been told he loves it  A little much to program it but overall good 
Before buying  I went to the sanus website and researched this model and made sure it would fit my TV s  Started off with buying one of these and with our smaller rooms we didn t need a huge amount of extention or tilt and wanted to keep them slim for profile we liked the first one so much  we bought 2 more  This offered us just what we needed   they are very flush with the wall and pull out about 10 inches and can tilt from side to side and down so we bought more becuase the price was one of the best for what it offered  You can spend hundreds of dollars on these so I feel it was a good bargain Installation was a bit tricky for us because of finding studs and also thinking about the height of where you want it placed versus where your tv will be attached  However  we found out how to measure so it made sense for us and it was right where we wanted it  We also learned that is was easier to leave the tv stand  base on the tv and remove it AFTER you have placed it on the wall mounted holder for the first one we had taken the base off and were trying to hold it    you can imagine holding a big tv and trying to remove the base  so waiting until the wall mount was done and we could rest the tv on it  it was much easier Once you do one  you can do the others much faster  This worked with our 59   samsung plasma  42   panasonic plasma  and 47   samsung lcd  Very versatile and many different parts to make it work with your tv   extentions  longer or shorter screws  etc  I would recommend this tv wall mount 
Quick install  easy template to trace and the template wasn t a flimsy piece of paper The cross over electronics  various resistors and caps  are housed in clear plexiglas won t get fouled with dirt and insulation from your attic They were good when I installed them but after I put a length of pink fiberglass roll over them  sound improved  That tip was in the manual Nothing but love  two tweeters and both are directional  paintable as well  Good value 
The system is great  but the only thing is   have to listen at high volume to get real good sound
Excellent system  easy to set up and sounds great 
Glad I decided to buy this because my mac was too slow when i had multiple tabs and apps open  Now I can see that it runs even better than before 
Great sounds from this petite product  Charges easy and simple to setup 
I underestimated these speakers  they sound great  I replaced all 4 speakers in my truck and am cery impressed  I already had replaced the stock radio with a Pioneer double din bluetooth radio and the combo is excellant  I was originally going tonget pioneer speakers  but the salesperson told me that ine of their installers highly recommended these over any of the pioneers so i decided to give them a try and have no regrets  
Hooks up nice good sound and my iPod hooks up nicely blue tooth works well nice sound
I purchased this for my daughter s car  She loves the bluetooth capability and enjoys the ability to make calls hands free 
It has a pretty great sound for speaker being so small  Would recommend for indoor  outdoor listening  It s awesome 
very good speaker  easy to use  loud  no problems using around water 
Purchased these once for the sole purpose of being able to use bluetooth for media audio  One side didn t work  I ended up upgrading to the Beats bluetooth model 
This is one of the better Bluetooth speakers I have ever owned Considering the retail price versus what I paid for it Or use it along with my Amazon echo And the combination of the two Couldn t be better though the speaker would work as a standalone take to the beach  or anywhere in the house  The bass boost Is excellent The clarity and Fidelity is awesome as well Since I bought this I ve had no desire to own another Bluetooth speaker 
Bluetooth will not sync unless I hook up my USB cord first
I ve spent money recently on small portable Bluetooth speakers  but I always found myself at max volume wishing for so much more  When I listen to music  I want it to be an experience  not just a song  So  I decided to make a BIG leap in power  bypassing all of the pricier bluetooth portables that I knew I d inevitably be disappointed in and opted for the new LBT GPX555  Granted  I had to sacrifice portability and space in exchange for raw power  but it was a trade off I was willing to make  And boy  I couldn t be happier  The audio quality and power from this system will literally blow you away and you ll be nervous to push the volume much past halfway  Plus  Sony s 2014 design style looks great with very futuristic angles and lines that compliment my 27 inch iMac in between the 2 speakers  Bluetooth functionality and the LED light show are the icing on the cake of an excellent product that should provide many years of listening pleasure  So  if you don t really need portability  don t spend hundreds on dinky sounding bluetooth speakers when you can have A LOT more sound for just a little bit more money 
These are remarkable  Don t waste your money on the competitors  they are not in this league This are for serious audiophiles 
I busted my chowder all over the screen  Great television  Easy cleanup 
My wife told me to order these for myself for fathers day  I ve been reading reviews for months on outdoor speakers and finally decided on these since Def Tech has such a great reputation  I just installed them and even though they re not broken in  WOW  I couldn t be happier with them  I listen mostly to classic rock and 90 s grunge and it all sounds great  I definitely recommend them 
I set it up today in our gym and WOW  Is all I can say 
I purchased this product as a birthday gift for my husband and to have music entertainment for my home  I am so greatly pleased with this product and all the features it has to offer 
Due to my position  I have to have security on my Electronics that often contain Protected Health Information  PHI  I had this in mind when I purchased the biometric keyboard for my Microsoft Surface Pro 4 So the good news is that the biometric meter does work    most of the time At times  the biometric device shows an  error  unable to read message that it credits  perhaps  a smudged reader screen  Typically  the quick fix is to wipe reader with my shirt or sleeve   probably better with a wipe   All in all  it works most of the time and is a quicker way to  sign on  than entering my 20 character password The keyboard easily comes off and on with the tablet and it is magnetized allowing for the keyboard to be at an angle compatible with typing while I was in flight 
For just a few dollars more  you can use a finger swipe to login  Nice feature  Worth the money  Only comes in black though 
Great sounding small speakers for Home Theater and music  I wanted small speakers for our great room  Room size is large and the surround sound experience is terrific  Room placement is key to maximize the sound  HIghs are crisp  Mids are spot on  and Bass is very enjoyable too  The bass woofer box is really not a sub  rather than the speaker that adds the bass to the system  Although Bose is expensive i am very satisfied with the sound  I give a thumbs up   
The XB30 is a big  heavy portable speaker that can fill a room with sound  Pairing with an iPad and also an Android smartphone was a snap  and I experienced very little static or lag moving upwards of 20 25 feet from the speaker  This unit features an Extra Bass button  and you really need it  when off  the sound lacks the full  rich signature Sony sound One of the selling points of this machine is a lights feature  This speaker can flash like a strobe light or emanate mood lighting for different settings like cool  warm  party  etc  While it is a nice feature  accessing it requires the downloading of a free app to your smart device  which can be a turn off for consumers Soundwise  the XB30 is really a room filler  Physically  it s not as small as some other devices on the market  but what you lack in portability you gain in massive sonic appeal  Bottom line  this is what you re really looking for 
Big bass  very portable  Bluetooth and Wi Fi connectivity were a plus plus it was controllable with the SongPal app  Bluetooth pairing was not intuitive so I needed to go online to learn how 
I ve been considering getting a wireless speaker like this for a while and after trying out the various floor models  seeing the designs  and even purchasing   returning a competing product  this speaker has completely met my expectations and then blasted those out of the water At the current price of  99  you cannot get a better speaker with 24 hr battery life and bass this rich and deep  Turning this up even to 70% can fill my house to the point that you need to talk over the music The light feature is something I thought I d care 0% about but it adds a decent amount of atmosphere and my kids LOVE IT  Nice thing is you can download the Sony app and turn off the light feature or choose from various presets  Usually I just keep it off to save battery life though 
I love this speaker  I was in the market for a decent wireless bluetooth speaker  and I usually go with Sony products  I bought this on sale  about  30 off regular price  only because the box boasted Hi Res Audio and Extra Bass  The sound quality coming out of this speaker is excellent  I could not ask for anything better  I am currently considering purchasing another to pair the two  The only faults of this speaker are the price and supported apps  Very confusing out of the box  but I guess the Song Pal app makes it easier to pair to it than just doing it without  BUY on sale 
My desktop pc was starting to bog down when I d have multiple programs running and try to manipulate large spreadsheets  Add a macro and things would stop functioning or become very sluggish  I added the DDR4 memory and haven t had an issue since  Minus 1 star because they are a bit wide and a little tight when installing 
The wider key spaces help avoid fat fingering  and I LOVE the fingerprint ID  I don t use the touch pad  but obviously the larger one on this keyboard would help someone who did  I m using with a Surface Pro 3  and everything integrates perfectly  Set up is simple 
After having a couple of surface s  and keyboards  this is the best one yet  I love the fingerprint ID for logging in and the feel of the keys  It s also very responsive as compared to older keyboard versions 
big improvement over the last keyboard for surface
purchased to replace original surface pro 3 keyboard  much better feel and fingerprint reader is handy feature
The wifi on my laptop went kaputt  Buying this prevented me from purchasing a new computer 
This was my third Harmony Remote  My last one was an 880  I simply wore the other two out  wishing the buttons were a little more robust   I am a big fan of Harmony  I had great expectations of this one but it has let me down  The feel is good  the layout looks good but it is unbalanced and the touch screen just simply sucks  It is a very poor quality touch screen  I don t need to go on and on about it  Luckily  I bought this from Costco and I was able to return it easily  I am looking to buy the 700 online even though it is no longer being made by Logitech 
After a few minutes playing with SONY s new XB30  I knew I was in trouble  Too many nieces and nephews who would feel left out if I gifted any one of them and not any of the others with this truly fun music box  Great sound  immense power handling  colorful  bright  and wickedly cool  Took mere seconds to get my laptop connected to the SONY XB30  Hit play and Adam Levine was sounding big  bold and great filling my large family room on this rather pint sized sound box  Disconnected it from my laptop  and pulled out my iPhone 6  Within minutes I was playing Feist with perfect sound quality  My iPhone offered to download a Sony App to further control the XB30  but it was not necessary  It does let me adjust the volume from the App so I don t need to go up to the Sony XB30  but so what The SONY XB30 has a few special tricks  A double click of the play button skips you forward  A 3 click pattern jumps you backwards in the song  It will apparently tie together with multiple SONY devices of this special EXTRA BASS SERIES so the kids can have a really loud party  Yikes  Oh       and it s a L I G H T S H O W  Yeah  it lights up like an 80s disco  Shrink that massive boom box from the 70s  80s into a milk carton size  quart    double the volume  add a light show and it connects with whatever music library you have on your phone  Not bad  Not bad at all  I m gonna need to get a few more of these SUMMARY  If there is something I could bring back from a visit to the 1980s  it might be the totally frivolous spirit of musical fun embodied by boom boxes  Boom boxes  for the too young to know  were portable  but powerfully loud  all in one stereos that could entertain your moving party  Sony brings back all of the fun and eliminates the unnecessary  The ubiquitous smart phone has all the music you could ever carry  and bluetooth links to Sonys powerful speaker  Add to the mix a light show using LEDs creating little burden on your portable power  youre ready to go

This speaker packs a BIG punch in a small package  It s a LOT louder than other speakers in its class but the EXTRA bass is where you get your money s worth 
needed this for basketball practice in gym    fills out the room nicely   
I love listening to these headphones  They have a musical quality that just warms my heart  My setup is high fidelity streaming computer audio into an external DAC and then a vacuum tube headphone amplifier  The soundstage is amazingly wide  The bass is full and deep yet sounds very natural  The highs are crisp and clean without distortion  Some reviews have stated that the midrange is lacking  but I don t agree  The overall sound is well balanced and doesn t have any midrange deficit to my ears  I thought the price a bit high  but when you combine the sound quality with the sturdy stylish construction  it becomes a fair purchase  I have listened to these headphones for hundreds of hours of pleasure  They fit my head well and I often forget that I have them on while I am getting lost in the music  You would have to spend twice what these cost to get a higher level of sound quality  Very highly recommended 
Great product  would have loved to keep it but unfortunately I had to return the item I had purchased for its use  The fingerprint function does save a lot of time and worked very well
Wish description had made clear that it wouldn t coordinate with an Amazon firestick  That s what I bought it for so it had to go back 
I don t know if the tv was good or bad  The box said it was a 32 screen tv  but when we opened the box and took out the tv  it was a 28 screen tv  Beware when you purchase a tv and require a certain size  And when I sent it back I was charged a fee for something I did not purchase  
This TV DOES NOT have the SAME BASE as Pictured in the Photo  It has a SPLIT LEG BASE not a solid wide base  The Model Number on the Amazon Page is the SAME Model Number on the TV I received but the TV STAND is NOT the same  BEWARE if you need it to fit properly in a certain spot you need to know that there is a 23 SPACE BETWEEN the LEGS  I had to put the legs on BLOCKS to get it to fit 
This mini bookshelf system is compact and functional  the speakers sounded very good and it is worth the price  It is louder than expected and not much distortion at max volume  i would recommend it  perfect for a dorm room 
The finger print scanner works great  and the new layout makes this a full size keyboard  A real improvement 
Like this keyboard so much better and the fingerprint sensor is very handy for passwords  
easy set up even if app was very slow  same function less keys better use of buttons still customizable
Much better than my factory speakers I got with my car
Took back the Sennheisser M2 Momentum Wireless grips for these as overall they were a better fit  and sound quality is a tad better  crisp 
Simple and  universal  remote do not go together  But once you have owned 2 previous models and have tweaked them to perfection  this model WAS simple  One button   transfer settings   and you re up and running  Changes yes  but easy enough to get used to  If you ve never owned one it will be challenging but rewarding 
I bought this Type Cover because my last laptop had a fingerprint reader and I really wanted to be able to take advantage of Windows Hello in Microsoft Edge when developers  hopefully  start taking advantage of that technology  Even though the keyboard is extremely thin  there is just enough travel on the keys for you to feel like your typing on a  real  keyboard  I actually like the way the keys feel more than the keys on my old laptop  A Type Cover is an essential accessory for your new Surface  for an extra  10 the added benefit of a fingerprint reader can t be beat 
It took me weeks of research before I purchased this product  I liked the idea of the Yamaha name  but was concerned the quality would be less than optimal because the price was so low  While I am not an audiophile I like to have the best my limited money can buy  The 6 Ohm rating was a big hiccup for me as well  as 8 ohm is what all receiver ratings are calculated on  But after looking closely at the manual for my receiver I found it supported 6 16 Ohm speakers  So we were good there  My receiver  a Pioneer VSK 519 showed up before my speakers so I hooked it up to some Sony book shelf speakers to test it out  When the Yamaha speakers came I was only able to hook up three of the five speakers with the included speaker wire  so I used the Sony s as R and L  The Sony s put out noticeably more sound than the Yamaha s which was at first concerning to me  And once I got them out of the way I had to turn the receiver up higher to get the same output  I watch movies right around 50 52 when with the Sony speakers  I was quite happy at 40  I suspect this is related to the 82 db rating  and the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5   But turning the Amp up a little higher is not a big deal and the Receiver has been very happy in it s low ventilation area  and is in no danger of overheating I also upgraded my speaker wire to 16 gauge and have not noticed a difference Other thoughts  even though the Sub is a 100W amp  it only produces 50W of output  just like it says on the Manufacture site  So Amazon was a little misleading there  No big deal  because the Sub is quite adequate in my 1200 sqft house  it is everywhere  my poor wife My Brother who spent well over 1000 on his surround sound  Mine  100 Read more
Still getting used to it but it is easier than the older Harmony One  Wanted this one to connect to The Nest Thermastats we will be purchasing 
Just amazin
These speakers are far better than I expected them to be  They are only rated at 68Hz as the lowest they will go but they sure sound like they go a lot lower than that  The bass response is great for a 6 5 inch speaker and they sound nice and clear and they vibrate my rear view mirror  I have 60W per channel going into these They fit in my car perfectly too  I had read at some websites that my car used 6 5 inch speakers and at others  like crutchfield s that it used 6 75 inch speakers  Well  Amazon com was right and it uses 6 5 inch speakers  Thanks Amazon  I really appreciate it  I was even able to use the original OEM bolts to mount them 
These headphones are easy to set up with any blue tooth system  Sound is good and they have good battery life 
Works great   Charge the same day you plan to use it or the night before  I think it losses a charge between taking it off the charger and using it  like any battery 
These sound better than my Bose  When my son said that I had to try his  Yep they are 
So I researched headphones before I went to the store  I narrowed it down to Beats studio and Bose sound link wireless headphones  I previously owned a pair of Skull Candy platinum wired headphones  The sales guy at the Brooklyn store suggested that I go with the JBL Everest Elite because I told him I mostly listen to music  movies while traveling via airplane  Selling points of these headphones are the app so you can customize the sound  voices for movies  or bass for music  and the ambient noise reduction  You get a pretty good range on them and the battery isn t bad at all  They come with a carrying case and extra cords  charging  aux  etc  My conclusion is yes they are better than Beats 
These headphones are great  I was going to get the beats   but they were too bass heavy  These headphones have the right balance of lows  highs and mids  It was difficult figuring out how to pair different devices   but it s possible  These headphones work both with IOS and Android  Very pleased with my purchase 
I really would have preferred the polks  but they don t seem to be carried in stores anymore  at least not the one near me   but I was pleasantly surprised by these  They aren t  quite  at the point the difference from mp3 and flac files are noticeable  but it does pick up some distinctions at the high frequencies which is rather impressive for a 6x8  The lower frequencies were about equal though for the two file types  however in their defense I actually have trouble on lower frequencies on my home system that have drastic differences in audio quality on the two file types   but still  they are just perfect for a commute speaker 
The Logitech Harmony Ultimate One works pretty well  with 2 exceptions  First  It frequently drops the correct HDMI cable setting when I switch directly from cable TV  HDMI 1  input to Roku  HDMI 2  input for streaming video input  Netflix or Amazon   It s easily fixable  but it s still a pain  Also  I miss a number key pad instead of using the video keypad input which often doesn t work  With that in mind  this thing is still better than using 2 or 3 remotes 
Better than beats I will not regret buying these  Jbl is quality over a brand name 
My internet speed was dragging with previous adapter  BB salesman recommended this one   it boosted my internet speed by about 3X 
At my old house we had Bose 251 that were great  When we moved the new owners wanted to keep the Bose speakers and I needed new speaker for my backyard I was close to buying a new pair of Bose speakers but found the reviews on this speaker s little brother the AW5500 The consensus is that the AW5500 is better than the Bose251 I chose the bigger speaker AW6500 and the sound is wonderful and carries throughout the entire backyard without being noicy The final sound comes down to what amplifier you are using and how much power you feed the speakers with 
I have been a long time fan of the Harmony remotes  I cannot even remember how many different models I had purchased over the years   I was ecstatic when the harmony smart control came out  I loved the idea with an iPhone app for more complex functions and a simple non screen remote for the day to day usage After a while though I found myself using the iphone app more and more   This lead to keeping phone charged  Unlocking it to get to app  Launching app  So I thought an Ultimate remote added on to my hub would be great It was not The migration was easy enough but right off the bat the Ultimate would not turn my TV on and Off   It would not control my appletv AT all  Said I had to setup the remote as a bluetooth keyboard  Did not have to do that with the other ONE remote  Even after setup it worked periodically and the bluetooth would pair and unpair and pair and unpair The bugs and glitches took me back to the first Gen Harmony  I gave up after 2 hours Expensive is not always better  Do yourself a favor Get the smart control with the simple remote and the iPhone apphttp     www amazon com  Logitech Harmony Control Smartphone Simple  dp  B00BQ5RYI4  refsr12ieUTF8qid1405979126sr8 2keywordsharmony remoteit is much simpler and cheaper yet still gives you the iphone app so you can do more in depth changes if needed 
I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE BUT AS I READ IN OTHER REVIEWS THIS ITEM DO NEED A BETTER INSTRUCTION MANUAL    
This keyboard is a lot better than earlier versions  I like the feel and the response found the keys  Raised keys I can feel more like a real keyboard then anything else 
Love these  Have a few in various rooms and they work well  Only complaint is the actual touchscreen could be a little faster  Responds to touch well but animation becomes a wait game while it does fancy screen switching  Wish that could be turned off
After dreaming about an outdoor system for a while  and after reading all the reviews on many of the outdoor speakers in my price range  I popped for these  Not disappointed  great full rich sound  I live in a rural area and am able to easily fill the entire area with crisp clear music  Of course I don t have any neighbors to annoy  Powered with a Yamaha receiver  and run through an apple express I can control everything through my IPhone  Great set up for working out in the yard or grilling  Mounted them on a garden shed under an awning for a little protection of my investment  You won t be disappointed 
I ve tried a lot of wireless mice and this is by far the best one so far Compared to other wireless mice  this one has  one of the better shapes in my opinion acceptable battery life a reasonable weight little to no lag
This mouse has a great soft matte black finish and RGB lighting  The included charging cable works great and is braided  This is the best wireless mouse I ve ever used and I d recommend it to any PC gamer 
Really enjoy listening to my favorites without any commercials  A great selection of genres 
I purchased this stand and used it for a 55 Samsung LED Smart TV  The stand works well and the assembly was fairly easy  It is a pretty solid assembly with the 55 TV  I have no concerns about it tipping but I would strap it to the wall if there were children in the home  The price point is great  The kit included several different bolts and washers to attach the mount to nearly any type of TV  I would give it 5 stars however  I had to use different bolts and washers with the mount  The TV wobbled and shook with the bolts that were included with the kit  I recommend that if you are moving from a wall mount to table top that you use your old wall mount bolts 
The software was easy to install and easy to connect  For me  I don t have much loss for network speed  I have had 0 packet loss  Only downside is that it s huge  so I have to use the base  but that s no reason to knock a star 
Saw one at a friends  house and decided I had to have one  Once you get everything programmed it s very easy to use  The icons for the various tv networks make it easy to navigate  There is a learning curve on looking up the available channels to program into the unit depending on your particular service  Don t just click on  available twc  in your area  You will only get about 10 channels  Use the lookup for your location  You will find them all there 
I puchased 1 of these remotes last year and purchased 2 more this year  Best universal remote on the market  Easy to setup for the beninner 
I own a surface pro 3 and this is by far the best typing cover for this device  It FINALLY feels like a real keyboard  The finger print sensor works well and is a nice extra  It is also backlit which is great 
Coming from mechanical switch keyboards and Thinkpads and typing upwards of 120 wpm I m really picky about keyboards  Having tried so many type cover keyboards this is clearly the best and even better than a lot of laptop keyboards on the market for tactile and audible feedback  key travel  effective palm rejection  full size keyboard  easy toggling between top row special keys and function keys by pressing Fn key  large glassy smooth touchpad  backlight and bonus fingerprint reader for easy biometric log in all in a thin light package  Perfect for the Surface Pro 4 and even backwards compatible with Surface Pro 3 
Best value I bought three 1 50 1 40 1 32 All great
We have been a Logitech Harmony owner since 2004  Our current Harmony controller was wearing out so we needed to find a replacement  This new controller is much better than our old Harmony and my wife really appreciates the ability to simply pick her viewing options  This is one great controller 
I love this TV  is simple to use   I love the image  the sound  the size and control remote
I ve used many tablet keyboards but this one is by far the best  Fits perfectly with magnetic connection and does not come loose  The response on the keys is nice even though it is a small tablet keyboard  The fingerprint sensor was easy to setup and is accurate and easy to use  I used to use the iPad Pro with keyboard with keyboard and recently switched to a Surface with keyboard  No comparison  I was able to do so much more with the Surface 
Good keyboard  fingerprint scanner does not work for SP3
The new keyboards are great  a little roomier and easier to type at speed without as many typos 
These speakers are AMAZING  As a sales rep  these are my go to speakers for the best bang for your buck  and they have crystal clear sound  24 hour battery  and amazing bass  And yes  you can turn off the light show  by holding down the extra bass button or by using the music control app 
I was confused between Bose sounlink mini II and Sony  I went for Sony and they kept my expectations  Good job here Sony  I think it has one con  paring multiple XB30 is irksome  A software update should suffice connection problem 
I purchased 4 of the 6500 s for my outdoor kitchen area also added def tech center channel with sub  unbelievable sound   Marantz 1605 receiver pushing plenty sound these speakers sound amazing  could easily be featured speakers for indoor entertainment area  speakers cost a little bit more but you get what you pay for  I will redo indoor system and will strongly consider def tech products going forward  AMAZING SPEAKERS
Easy Bluetooth connection  remember last device it was hooked up to if your like myself and have multiple Bluetooth devices  I ve noticed my other devices tend to prioritize iOS over Android but this doesn t do that  Amazon Alexa is heavily integrated with the UE MegaBlast  If your a heavy user of Amazon services and product this is for you  If not as a Bluetooth speaker there s other options at this price point that will give you better physical controls  unless you prefer voice control for things like skip  previous track  volume  If you have smart home devices connected to Alexa you ll be able to control them thought this speaker  The only draw back I can find with this was the missing controls like the UE Mega Boom speaker  Touch controls are missing like placing your hand over the top to mute a song  tapping to skip a song  These sound allot better than the boom since this unit has bigger speakers than the other units  Water and dust proofing on all UE products are great  taken to parks  beaches  tailgating  pool parties I can say these speaker are 2 year old proof as well  Thrown in pools  buried under sand castle  tossed from slowly moving truck bed  While still looking new since the fabric used hasn t shown any wear or tear  Software is upgradeable  I foresee a long life with this speaker  Which brings me to battery life  16 hours at mid level volume which is okay for this type of speaker  Overall I enjoy this speaker  being a heavily user of all things Amazon this is an easy integration of my Amazon ecosystem  Since voice control is getting better I prefer voice over tactile controls  The protections you get are better than most Bluetooth speaker on the market 
Has awesome sound and bass  Perfect for outdoors and any amp 
This is best speaker to listen in room plus you make it surround sound
I love this speaker   the sound is very clear and i love the bass
The P7 s are the best sounding headphones I ve ever owned  I personally haven t really tried any headphones in the same category  except maybe the V Moda Crossfade  but that is  100 less and definitely inferior to the P7 s But  I think there are basically only 2 huge pros � Sound quality is amazing and pretty neutral with a perfect amount of bass� Stylish yet solid build qualityA few minor cons � A bit bulky if you re used to smaller headphones� Buttons on the cable aren t the best to grip  they are plastic  lines  � Could have included better case and accessories for the priceAll in all  I think you re paying for the sound quality here and you re definitely getting it  Unfortunately  lower quality audio files tend to be more noticeable on the P7 s  but hey that s not what you re listening to with these right? Minor cons aside  the P7 s sound better than anything I have ever owned or even tried 
Absolutely blew my mind how crisp and clear the sound was even at max volume  Sub hits hard and sounds great  Exceeded my expectations  highly recommend 
Best sounding premium noise canceling bluetooth headphones I ve heard  I ve had a lot  I love music and want to hear the ranges  Only con was comfort  after a while of extended use they became uncomfortable to wear  I had to return them 
This portable speaker is loud  charges quickly and lasts a long time on a single charge 
It is Sony  Anything Sony is normally quality so I went with it and I am not disappointed at all 
I was debating on this one and the pill       But I chose the h ear go and the sound is amazing is like if a had a stereo in the house but all that came from this little device and for a good price wort every penny of it     I m really satisfied with my purchase no mistake made 
just bought the sony lbtgpx555 couple days ago what a beast love the sound love the lights great clear sound and love the bass  also i love that it has bluetooth so i can play my ipod or when my wife dosnt want to hear my music i can put my wireless beats on  for the price i paid for 499 99 is very well worth it   i love sony they are the best  
just got my today i love the light on it pretty awesome Stereo and its pretty loud makes your neighbor    
My all time favorite remote  I install custom home theaters for a living and I ve installed many smart remotes  This remote is the best I ve ever used  Any smart remote is only as good as the programming done on the remote  but done right it can t be beat Pros  Replaces ALL your old remotes with 1 Harmony  Looks awesome  fits in your hand perfectly  uses great software for programming  cheaper remotes use software that stinks   large touchscreen  rechargeable battery Cons  expensive  although very reasonably priced for what the remote can do vs  other brands  set up is technical  but can be done if your computer savvy  no hard number keypad  It s on the large touchscreen  which I personally like better  
Bought this speaker because I needed something small that was also loud  This speaker is amazing and the LEDs add a wow factor to it  Coated with a slick rubber that gives it a nice touch 
Upgraded from last model and no longer need a long cable from my router to the slinbox since this one now has Wi Fi
I have owned several different universal remotes from years back a large sony touch screen to an earlier model Harmony and this one beats them all  Easy to program and the rechargeable feature kills the rest  One feature I do not like about the device is that I can not turn my components off individually with out using one of my programmed functions 
This is the fourth home theater setup I have configured this remote easily controls what most people want to do  After getting used to a single more pricy remote to control a theater with 9 devices and being able to turn on and off with 1 button push you never want to go back to the individual remotes  My last setup included a smart TV  Receiver  sound bar  Blu ray player and media player  This much flexibility can drive most people crazy  With this remote I was able to setup one touch screen button activities to Watch TV  Watch Media Player  Play DVD  Blu ray discs  Stream Netflix and Play My Music and turn off also with one touch  This remote lets you log and load all the commands for you devices from Harmonys extensive library and setup activities to use them in logical sequence  The only difficulty you may find is that some sound bars have complicated interfaces to smart TV s  Some older components have on  off controls that toggle with repeated pushes rather than having a code for each  This remote transitions smoothly if you want to change activity and when done one push off  While it seems a little pricey it will save you a ton of frustration  Top Marks for the Ultimate One Touch 
This is our second remote of this model  It is small  works great and the charge cradle rocks  We hated the usb cable lying around and falling off the table when not in use 
Logitech   Harmony Ultimate One 15 Device Universal Remote is the Best Remote i ever had So Smart touch screen very easy to setup and use  
Very easy to program  Controls all your gadgets  This is the best remote ever  You can personalize it with pictures and phrases  Easy to use anyone can use this 
I am an AV professional  I always disliked Harmony remotes in the days when you had to answer dozens of questions on the internet to get it programmed and you couldn t make any fine adjustments  I finally decided to replace my  go to  URC remotes with a Harmony after getting an Amazon Echo Dot  I read that you could voice command the Harmony through the Echo  I started with the Smart Home Control  Hub   Companion remote  in my bedroom  Programming was easy  adjustments could be made to tweak the settings and the Alexa interface was cool  Then I added this Ultimate One to the package because it was a better interface for my wife  touchscreen  backlit buttons  favorite channels  etc   Now she has the Ultimate on her side  I have the Companion on my side and we both have Alexa  Added the Ultimate Home package  Hub   Ultimate  to my Living Room with another Echo  of course  Also added a couple of TP Link Smart Plugs for Alexa controlled lamps in each room  My wife loves it and I couldn t be happier  Harmony has come a long way  Highly recommended Read full review   
Absolutely the best remote without a doubt  The setup couldn t of been easier  Love having one single remote instead of five other ones 
Remote is great for minimizing the use of multiple remotes across products  It even controls my Fire Stick   
This universal remote is great  It is easy to program and use  With the touch of one button you can turn on and operate all devices needed to watch TV or many other activities 
very versatile remote can be programmed to users desired settings and online set up makes set up a snap
Easy to use  My iPhone and iPod work great with this radio 
Best picture and clarity of all my TV very smart easy to operate I can see the pores in people s faces
By far best stereo system I ve seen  Excellent Light show and wonderful sound quality that can go to an impressive volume with the perfect amount of bass  Bought it for a party and it worked great  Sound carried throughout whole room  HUGE ballroom  without even being on max  Definitely buy THIS speaker  you ll never regret it 
These are the best pair of headphones I ve ever had  Granted  I know there are much better headphones out there  but at this price  this is the best I ve heard  Comfy fit  and the bells and whistles are cool  Auto calibration and Ambient Aware are awesome features  Highly recommend 
Extensively tried NC Beats and Bose  Bose had the comfort Beats had the punch  NC Bose lacks bluetooth and once you ve had bluetooth convenience you want to keep it  Then tried the JBLs  great sound  good comfort and bluetooth too  Simply the best of all worlds  So glad I tried them before having to settle for one of the others 
Great speakers  very clean sound and loud and super nice
Not only do these speakers sound great but DefTech service is second to none  They stand behind everything and will replace or repair at no cost  They go the extra mile 
very good batery last alot and materials are grate  i use to play shotting games
If you like old school type audio products then these are the headphones for you  Sound quality was superior to many other premium brand products including Sennheiser  AKG  and Dennon  Durable well made product which feels as good as it looks 
I have the Harmony hub and wanted another remote for a different room  system Very easy to install  easy to make macros  WAY quicker IR blasts than previous remotes so the macros go faster Highly recommend this and the smart hub   btw  I use Alexa   the Echo  with the hub and don t even know where the remote is half the time   hey Alexa    turn on xbox 
My preferred drive for a NAS   have used these for many years with never a problem   highly recommended 
This is the best music system I ve got it has got many features like bass bazuka isolated wireless streaming and many more very loud speakers the voice is very clear the bass is very clear 
Love the LED and g logo  Very easy to move and click 
I own both a g502 and g602 for my home and work  I picked up the g403 for my laptop setup  and it is the best mouse I ve owned  Sure  it doesn t have all the gaming bells and whistles from the other two  but I would gladly trade them all for the g403 for all my environments  This mouse really is responsive  feels great  and the option to go wired or wireless is amazing 
Works great  So loud   the waterproof aspect makes it perfect by our pool  We absolutely love it and will be buying a second one 
Four years ago  I started using these Sony Mini DV Cassettes and was blown away by their quality  The tapes themselves capture excellent video and audio recordings  and they transfer this quality to my video editing software I am also impressed with how durable these tapes are  When I travel internationally  these tapes sometimes get exposed to the heat and a lot of moisture  Although I don t encourage exposing them to the elements  these tapes have proved extremely durable  Part of what makes them so durable is that the engineering design protects the tape extremely well  Also  each Mini DV Cassette comes with it s own hard case  so they are extremely easy to transport and store I strongly recommend these tapes to anyone who wants to produce a high quality personal video  It may also be helpful to know that I have friends studying film at USC who have shot several independent films using these tapes  These are not the same materials that Hollywood uses  but it is encouraging to know that these tapes are capable of producing such a high quality video 
I have four Logitech remotes  not including the Harmony Ultimate One  When my oldest remote failed  I replaced it with the Harmony Ultimate One and it is the best and easiest to use of all my Logitech remotes  The only negative comment I have is the battery doesn t last as long as in my other remotes  so you have to keep an eye on the battery indicator to make sure you get it on the charger before it dies 
This keyboard not only makes Surface Pro laptop mode completely usable  but also acts as a cover for the screen or can be reversed to act as a back for tablet mode  The mouse pad is a flat finish glass  so it won t get the normal worn look of other mousepads  Great addition to the surface pro  Oh yes  the fingerprint option is easy to set up and recognizes the finger at any angle 
I have been blown away by this keyboard which in my opinion is the BEST on any tablet out there  I am extremely impressed by the quick response of the fingerprint reader  I am 100 satisfied with this keyboard   which is a massive improvement from the original Surface Pro 3 keyboard  One word for any Surface Pro 3 owner get this keyboard   
The fingerprint scanner works flawlessly for me for logging in  I like the response of the keys and the glass trackpad is better than most  I d prefer a larger trackpad  I have large hands but it s a compact profile and works great otherwise  Other color choice would be awesome  I d like to have my kit in UofM colors  Go Blue 
I need a keyboard for my tablet  And this with the finger print makes my life so much easier 
The Fingerprint ID reader makes this keyboard the best  It s worth the extra money 
I am very pleased the Sling Box with being able to get more value for the TV Service I pay for  This works on all my devices remotely even my home in another State on my Large TV via a attached computer  Super Buy  
Love the apps screen is very sensitive can t go wrong with this indash from alpine it s a great choice
In order for me to get better ram I would have to order it and this doubled what the computer I bought had in it 
These are the best headphones I ve ever had  Everything about them are beyond what I would expect 
Noose cancellation were great as you can adjust it to your environment 
Sound quality is to the ear of the listener  What sounds good or bad to someone may not sound the same to someone else  I bought these yesterday and the sound and volume level are great for me  Especially if you use the Apple or Android app to adjust frequencies  I m far from expert on headphones but I ve owned Beats Studio  Bose QC 15  Bose QC 25  Beats Studio Wireless  and Plantronics Backbeat Pro  and to me these top them all in what I require in a headphone  With ANC turned off and the EQ adjusted via the app these have more than enough volume and sound better than all of the headphones I ve listed above  As for the ANC  Noise cancelling   Bose beats them but no headphone that I ve owned cancels 100% of the noise  I was able to hear voices  fans  lawnmowers  toilet flushes  etc  with both the pairs of Bose headphones I ve owned  The ANC on these is about the same as the Backbeat Pros  better than Beats  not as good as Bose   There is a slight hiss  comparable to the Beats and Backbeat Pro  when no music is playing and it does degrade the sound quality a bit but not to the point to say they sound bad  The ANC can be turned off through the app which eliminates the slight hiss and improves the sound quality a bit  So  to me  these are the best I ve owned thus far  SUMMARY  Sounds good with all genres of music   sounds even better with ANC off  ANC is pretty good and adjustable  Minimal sound leakage at high volumes  Comfortable to wear for long periods of time  Good features and easy to control  Can t go wrong with these in my opinion 
I bought these for my son for his birthday  He wanted a nice set of Bluetooth headphones  The sound quality is great right out of the box  I also like the app to customize the settings 
I tried all over ear headphones in the store  The beats weren t even in the same playing field  The Bose were great but for the type of music my wife likes these were way better  She s very pleased and for that  so am I 
A bit pricey but these are the best headphones you will hear  I have owned Beats and Bose neither touch the P7 s  These are the definition of audiophile headphones  If you decide to pick these up order a DAC as well  You ll see a huge difference even with a cheap one 
For this price point my expectations were limited  I was wrong  The connectivity is smooth and precise  The sound quality rivals corded systems  and you get a cord as an alternative to bluetooth  The build quality and look and feel is exceptional  Buy this product 
Now  I consider myself an audiophile who always has to have the best sound  I also get really tired of chords  so I started looking for Bluetooth headphones  I was pleasantly surprised by these  I take them on a walk every day  and they cancel out all outside noise with active noise cancelling  I can even block out unnecessary sounds like my mother yelling at me  Because it has active noise cancelling  there is a somewhat shorter battery life  but I can still get a good 6 7 hours out of it on a charge  They do take a little while to charge though  one hour of charge time only gets 40%  but I can charge them while I sleep  so no big deal there  Where these really shine is the excellent bass and studio feel  makes you feel like you re right in there as it was recorded 
This is my second headset for my iphone  my first was a LG  lasted only three months  these sound great and the battery is enough to last all day 
If you are looking for wireless headphones that sound great and don t break your bank account then you found them  The blue tooth range is great and the sound is nice  Easy to setup and use for iPhone and iPad users 
As a former Beats die hard  I took a chance on these and was amazed  These headphones sounds great and works with your bluetooth phone or smart watch  You can listen to music or talk hands free on your phone with great sound quality  I plan to purchase these for the whole family 
I reviewed a number of other brands  and could not find one that sounded nearly as good as these  I m a frequent flyer  and these have been just amazing  Long battery life  so far  and the sound is just amazing  Clear highs  deep and non booming lows  Highly recommended 
By far the best piece of equipment I have put on my head let alone ears  Relaxing when I was on a plane  to serious and upbeat while at work  So comfortable I forget where the lovely harmonic sound is coming from  I would upgrade from the other big name headphones any day to these  The cord is a bit short for laying in bed purposes otherwise a phenomenal investment 
I have an earlier version of this remote in our vacation home and  maybe because the components are also older  it doesn t work as consistently well as this one  I am using the new one with a new 4k TV  an Xbox One  Directv Genie and a new Denon receiver  It takes a few seconds to run the macros in the remote to turn on all of the components but every correction I make seems to be saved and synced whenever I go to the harmony website for updates  I m impressed it was so easy to program and would buy another when I m in the market 
You get what you pay for  but I also waited until this remote was on sale for  100 less bringing it down to  149 total  I ve used cheaper Harmony remotes without the Hub and got so so  sucess  The Hub makes a big difference in range and allows you to hide it with the dual extenters  It does take time and effort  finding the correct model of your gear will allow the remote work correctly  to program the remote  Your patience will pay off having to deal with a single remote 
Long lasting battery and great sound from a small speaker 
You can basically ignore the HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO features and focus on the unique skills this slightly hefty speaker has  Seamlessly joining with speaker groups in Google Home and Cast makes it useful even when you re not on the go  A barely noted feature lets you plug this into a computer or laptop and use the speaker s onboard DAC as your sound device  The sound is bass heavy with slightly weak mid range response but it is solid and feature packed 
This is a great addition to my collection of DSLR cameras  I can fit my Mavic Pro  my D7100  3 lenses  GoPro hero 5  and all my batteries and accessories  It s a great anti theft backpack when you are traveling and on trains 
Take your cable TV with you  Not every cable channel has  TV Everywhere  capability  No worries    just connect your Slingbox to your cable at home and start watching  Works inside your home network or anywhere you have Internet access  The app  web site may take a little getting used to but once you have mastered them it s as easy as using your remote control Avoid Sports Blackouts  Watch all your local channels while traveling  No TV in the backyard? No problem   bring your iPad with you and keep an eye on the game while enjoying the great outdoors I swear I m real and not some marketing person  I had one of the original Slingboxes but since they upgraded to HD  I was just waiting for the right time to upgrade my box  The M2 is quick and easy to hook up and I was watching in less than 10 minutes  The new lower price hit the mark If only they would get rid of the ads on the SlingPlayer  I guess that s the trade off for not paying for the app like the old days 
Best Detachable Keyboard out  now complaints whatsoever 
Feels great and attaches easily  I like the fact it s practical
This unit really ROCKS    I got it   I installed it in the parking lot with the wiring kit and install kit  It has everything you can ask for  I added a pair of kicker 6x9s I the front doors of my Jeep  WOW    I am going to put one in my other two trucks    Sony ROCKS     
Worked great right out of the box  Very fast and multi tasking is very good 
I bought this TV for my wife as a Christmas gift  It has made a good addition to her sewing room  was very easy to set up  and connecting to our cable service was a non event  Just needed to buy a HDMI cable to connect up  Easy peasy 
I already had s JVC unit in my truck  This unit plugged into the same connections so install was a snap  I chose this unit because of the deal of the day and I really needed a Bluetooth for my work The BT worked pretty easy at first time but sometimes if you touch the phone instead of the radio it does not work correctly when calls come in  Then the next time I m back in the truck it works  I m glad I chose this product and would buy again for other vehicles 
These were the best sounding option by far  The price relative to the sound was exactly what I was looking for 
It has been a great radio nothing on it Otha s broken it s been a month the resolution of the scream is the finest and it looks so fancy with the black trim around it
Very spacious and gives you the choice to custom fit your camera  lens   all with cushioned sections  Its very accessible   has unique pockets for all your accessories  Its the extra details that really make the bag  It was great for traveling   lightweight   a great color 
The Flipside 300 is my go to backpack for event photography and for urban exploring  It s sleek  has enough pockets and fits my body securely like a glove  The zippers are fluid and well made and there s an abundance of pockets for your variety of accessories  I also love the ability to strap on the waist strap  rotate the bag along your waist to your stomach and be able to swap lenses with the main compartment open  I ve bought two of these and hope they never discontinue  Highly recommended 
I have moved up from the Lowepro sling style camera backpack to this model and absolutely love it  The weight distributed evenly on both shoulders has made a huge difference for me comfort wise  I can carry the camera  tripod  multiple lenses and any small personal items I need for a photo shoot  Glad I made the switch 
When I was looking at this item  a Best Buy Rep assured me that it would NOT require the TV it was hooked up on to be on the same channel as the remote operator  In other words  if I was accessing it remotely and I wanted to watch a football game then my wife at home would be able to watch something different  I purchased it  set it up and it was the exact opposite of what the Best Buy Rep said  The TV  Cable box that it is hooked to will only display what is being called for by the remote user  I subsequently returned the product  I would recommend doing your own research and not relying on the experience of the Best Buy Reps  In addition  when the store manager in Danbury CT  read my account of what happened  he sent me an email asking for further info  I replied with the info  His solution was just to say sorry  Not acceptable for someone that had to travel an hour to the store  an hour home  an hour setting up the product  an hour traveling back to the store to return it and then an hour home  As an elite plus member I would have expected at least some type of discount coupon for my next purchase  I will not be shopping at Best Buy going forward and would recommend that you buy this and other electronic items elsewhere 
I used to not enjoy trips to best buy due to people not wanting to help  or even greet you  but this time I was greeted by the windows expert and he had explained alot  also gave me the lowest cost thanks to b h photo   
Adapter works great  Able to play games without buffering 
We purchased this stereo for our son s car   92 Grand Am   Easy installation  sounds great  mic with the hands free calling feature is superb  Bluetooth with his Galaxy S5 with no skips in music play  My husband now wants one for his Jeep    
Worked well speeded up the 8 yr old imac needed it for a long time best price even compared to internet  Also Mac Certified
Best Buy don t stand behind there problems The unit was broke out of my box 17 day s of fooling around with productThey wanted nothing to do with my M2Sling Box also sling box has very tough rules Buyers be where 
Holds a charge good  I can get 1 5 charges out of a full battery
Sounds great and i got it on sale  Even better than the price is the unexpected disco lights   You can even hook up multiple units to work together thus increasing the volume proportionately 
First  i want you all to know that i am a techno junkie  I will try as many items as possible to know that i own the best  A couple of months back  i was in the market for bluetooth headphones to pair with my iPhone  as i travel quite a bit  Admittedly  since they are not of the in ear variety  i had concerns that they wouldn t work well on an airplane  where it is extremely noisy  Also  keep in mind  that i tried a handful of other bluetooth headphones before settling on the AF32 s  To name a few  i ve tried the Jaybirds  Motorola s and Wireless Rhythm by Mikey s  Also  tried a few others  To begin with  for on ear headphones  i couldn t believe how the cabin noise from a plane had no effect on the sound  music i was listening to  For example  even the voices in movies i was watching  was very easy to hear  Now for the shocker  The bass that came from the AF32 s was shocking  It wasn t boomy at all  What i heard  was crisp bass that sounded on par with some of my go to over the ear headphones  Pairing the headphones to my iPhone couldn t have been easier  Better yet  it charges quickly via USB and holds a charge for quite a long time  I don t know how long it s rated  but i got 7 hours on my last trip with juice to spare  If i could make just one comment that i d like improved on future models  concerns the built in microphone  In quiet areas  the person on the other end of the phone had no idea i was wearing headphones  With lots of noise in the background  the person i was talking to commented that they were hearing quite a bit of noise  Honestly though  i bought these for their ability with music  When i m in a noisy environment  i simply switch back to using the iPhone s microphone  Let me tell you that it s a very small price to pay for the ability to listen to my music wirelessly  where the music sounds 100x better than i could have ever hoped  Allow me to save you time  If you are in the market for the best sounding bluetooth headphones  look no further  Don t be fooled by the reasonable price  They are truly that good  I don t know how Meelectronics did it  I will now be buying a few other AF32 s as gifts for friends and colleagues  If i can leave you off with one final word  it would be  Wow   Please keep in mind that i have no affiliation with the company or company representatives  Also  it is very rare that i take the time to write a review of products that i own  However  after spending some time with these  i couldn t help myself 
For the price I didn t expect much from these speakers  and when I got them they definitely exceeded my expectations  I have always been a fan of Yamaha audio equipment and when I was looking for a decent  cheap  set of 5 1 speakers for my Onkyo SR606 I came across this set and thought I d give them a try  Much to my pleasure they work great  I am only using 3 1 right now but the sound is far superior to any pre packaged HTS that I have looked at PROS   Price  quality of build  sound qualityCONS   plastic casing  style  not the greatest for displaying around your house  This is a very minor con

This worked just it should and very good for the price
I have had the JBL Everest Elite 700 for a few weeks now  I tried the Bose Soundtrue  Sony XtraBass  and Beats Studio and neither one could compare to the sound quality of the JBLs  The app works well and adds to the overall sound of the headphones  As of right now these are the best I have found available at Best Buy stores Sound I listen to a wide variety of music from rap to metal and everything in between  They have sounded great with every genre I have thrown at them  The bass is very clean and crisp not overpowering or drowning  The mids and highs are also excellent  The one problem I find with most headphones is the overall volume being too low  With these I find my comfortable listening level at only 1  2 the total volume instead of at full volume like the Xtra bass and Bose  The Beats were plenty loud but still did not sound as good overall  I purchased the Sony Xtra Bass because they sounded great in the store display but when I got them home it was nothing like in store  On the other hand  the store display does not do these headphones justice  They sound much better than the display units  The sound quality does take a hit when you plug them in directly to a device but not enough to take anything away from my rating  Bluetooth The range is excellent  I can leave my phone in one room and move around the house from room to room completely with little to no drop off  I have not tested the distance with a clear line of sight but I m sure it s as advertised  They only pair to one device at a time but I have not had any issues pairing with my iphone or computer Noise Cancelling The passive noise cancelling alone is pretty good due to the thick padding in the ear cup however  this pair of headphones has active noise cancelling which work very well  I can easily drown out the sound of the kids while they play just dance in the same room  This is my first experience with ANC so I really don t have anything to compare them to  I do not get that bluetooth  noise cancelling hum that some have referred to in their reviews Comfort The JBLs are very comfortable with their large ear cups and soft padding  They take a adjusting to find that perfect fit but once you find it you are good to go  I have done about four hours straight while doing homework and they have been awesome  They don t get hot and do not cause sweating either Overall these headphones are a little on the heavy side but that by no means is enough to take away from the comfort and what these headphones can do which is produce awesome sound 
I have a late 2011 MacBook Pro and it was running slow  I recently updated my hard drive to ssd but notice it was still slow when opening up a lot of programs  I added these bad boys and went from 4 to 8 gb  Now my laptop is running great and no issues yet 
It okay to work with for beginners  easy to setup   listen
I ve been using these tapes for many years and the video on the first ones still looks new  The tapes last forever 
Hey there This thing is INSANELY fast  I was going to get a more expensive one since I�m a gamer and stream but this thing was a perfect bang for the buck  Thanks again guys  Always go to bestbuy for most of my tech stuff that needs more of a hands on approach before buying  
Beautiful picture  Would buy the TV again if needed
The way to use is sooo fast  very clear image  smart buy   
Best sound I have experienced from any headphone  I have owned Bose  Sony  Beats Pro and  Shure headphones  These are by far the best  Only con is they are real sheep skin  If allergic to leather stay away 
It is a beautiful picture compared to the old tv we replaced  Service was good  Our installer done a very good job 
I couldn�t have gotten more for money  This t v  Has amazing resolution 
I was looking for a set of blutooth headphones that I could link up with my Samsung UHD TV  I tried  Beats by Dre  and they sounded good but that was it  just good  Beats are all in the name and thats it  These JBL s sound great  I was a little nervous at first with them being so new but not after hearing how they sound  They feel good and fit around the ears good  The noise canceling is so great I can t even hear my wife talk to me from 3 feet away also with the JBL App you and customize them to how you want them to sound to you re liking even more 
The front legs of the base attached to the tv are positioned in such a way that the tv is a little top heavy and subject to instability 
Great EXTRA battery power to have on a jobsite especially when many do not even have electricity at the start to charge my phone the traditional way 
Much better than my old 2010Jetpack  also from Best Buy  but much heavy n much thicker  Don t like it automatic start the device when plug in for recharge  Verizon charged me for  250 for half day use in Vancouver  Canada after the staff told me only charged  5 per month to add Canadian use 
Sames like my stock speakers and when volume goes to a certain point that s not even loud it distorts and can t hear what the words are
this is a good big screen mount that is fairly easy to mount
Replaced the original factory speakers which were 10 years old  Difference was night and day
Please do remember that this review is based on the use from a professional DJ and not your normal �Audiophile�  Now with that statement out of the way I was not very impressed with my overall purchase of the JBL� Everest� Elite 700 Headphones  There are some features that I did enjoy having  but there was a lot more that I was not very happy about JBL� Everest� Elite 700We�ll start out with the positives about the JBL� Everest� Elite 700 headphones  The headphones them selves fit very snug on my head  but that also might very from person to person  Very comfortable to wear during a 4 to 6 hour event  They turned out to be lightweight even though they are a larger size of headphone  I really enjoyed the perfectly sculpted ear cushions  They cup the ears perfectly and block out most of the ambient sound The JBL� Everest� Elite 700 features Bluetooth 4 1 and connects with ease every single time  The Bluetooth allows you to use the headphone built in media controls on the edge of the left ear piece  JBL� has also allowed use of the built in microphones for hands free calling when paired with a mobile device like a BlackBerry  Droid  or iPhone  Now if you don�t want to use or can�t use the Bluetooth feature they do come with a 3 5mm jack cable JBL� Everest� Elite 700 is also powered by a built in rechargeable battery that will last 15 amazing hours  so there are no worries about running out of power mid set  They charge up with the use of a micro USB port on the bottom of the right ear cup  The JBL� Everest� Elite 700 has built in auto off sensors to preserve that amazing 15 hour battery as well JBL� Everest� Elite 700Now onward to the nitty gritty  JBL� has packed them with NXTGen Active Noise Cancelling  It�s a cool feature and concept  but as for DJ use it�s not needed and if you get the basic JBL� Everest� 700 it can save you  100 USD  When spinning with this feature on I did notice the headset speakers bottoming out  This made it very annoying when trying to pick out specific sounds during a mix I feel like the structure of the JBL� Everest� Elite 700 could have been a lot better  Spending  300 USD on headphones they need to feel like they will last and not snap apart when you take them on and off  JBL� might have done this to gain the lightweight feel or just to save money on construction  If I used these for one tourist season outside everyday I don�t for see them making it all the way through  A plastic head band is not the best possibility on such a premium headphone JBL� also has listed �Smart Technology  Personalize your listening experience via the MY JBL Headphones app� on the box  This app is not compatible with MANY devices and judging by the many bad app reviews it doesn�t even function or work correctly  Again if a company is going to push such a high dollar product they need to get everything corrected ASAP JBL� Everest� Elite 700So overall from my standing point as a professional DJ the JBL� Everest� Elite 700 is a massively overpriced full plastic headphone with okay sound and features

Always loved Netgears hardware  and this is no different  Hooked up to my router easily and runs super fast 
I am an AV integrator  and although you can spend lots of money on a remote  this one is set up user friendly and has a minor learning curve 
Comfortable  sound great  Pair easily first time  every time 
I bought this to use as a whole house wi fi connection  I told the representative at the store exactly what my intentions were and he said it would work fine  After 2 units I realized that this is really only for a close range  hotspot   It would ve been nice if the rep  Had been able to advise me better  The whole process took 4 weeks   a lot of work   frustration on my part  It may work fine if you stay within 10 feet but otherwise not so good 
I absolutely love this keyboard  and I don t think it deserves a two star rating  but the durability is horrendous  This is a purely aesthetic keyboard  and there are now multiple tears on the edges of the fabric which completely ruins it  and triggers my OCD  3   and the trackpad has two noticeable scratches  My backpack has a pouch meant for laptops  so I am not just throwing it in a bag with pencils poking at it  I am hesitant to recommend this product unless you look to treat your SP4 with the utmost care 
Logitech web site would not recognize this remote  
It took me about a week of use to return this remote  And  I m not going to lie    I enjoyed returning it  Like seriously  knowing this thing was out of my life put a huge smile on my face Simply put  what drove me damn near bonkers is the fact that this remote operates off a bias that it is always correct  Seriously  this would be like hiring the worlds worse mother in law and ex wife and as personal channel changers   It s just not worth it  and I wouldn t wish it on my worst enemy Seriously  this probably is a great remote for a man cave  or if you live alone  But if you have kids  wives  in laws  friends  family  pets  etc  Just avoid this remote  You d think it would make things easier  but it doesn t Simply put  this remote makes a great toy  not a great tool 
Purchased 4 speakers same time I purchased the radio and the bass from the speakers are great and There is no amp hooked up to yet 
Speakers were easy to install and the sound is awsome 
Life made so simple with this remote and got to put away all my original remotes   
Ok kool no more thanks tho I took it all out on and made
Awsome remote controls all my equipment plus many more 
The look and wattage is spectacular  They are easy to set up and move around  No problems here 
If you want to take your tv anywhere this is the product for you 
One of the sticks of RAM turned out to be DOA  then the 2nd died about 3 hours after installing it  I would avoid this kit at all costs 
Terrible product  if you have ever tried the original Harmony One  Starting with the MyHarmony Windows app  or the browser equivalent myharmony com  that offer a lot less programmability than the old Harmony Remote Software  Importing existing settings from previous remotes is far from accurate  The Ultimate One was unable to control a Pioneer Elite TV  a Linksys DMA 2200 media center extender  and to understand that I have my media center PC always on  Marred by several device incompatibility and by awful  awful design  how practical is it to have the Play  Pause Skip  Back buttons on top To use the playback controls means pushing buttons at the tip of the remote  so it is not firmly in your hand  Therefore  no one hand wielding and thumb controls  you need one hand to hold the remote steady and the other to push buttons  The ffwd  skipfwd button combo is not good  despite the haptic feedback  as the extended press is a waste of time and not very accurate because of lag  The touchscreen menus are confusing  bare and unappealing  The scrolling system not very sensitive  I do not want to have to swipe the touchscreen every time I want to access some info or programmed function  It s just another annoying step  There are a hundred more negative things I could say about it  I strongly disliked it  despite being a fan of the half dozen other Harmony remotes that I have programmed over nearly ten years 
Logitech really dropped the ball here   beauty of the original Harmony One was the number of physical buttons and the button layout  The transport buttons were right where your thumb lives   perfect  Now  these button are the the top    and the number of buttons is reduced  Please   please Logitech   see the horrific error of your ways and bring back the layout of the original  One  
The device will not connect using Bluetooth  I have tried two Galaxy S5 s  an iPhone 6  and my laptop  Followed the instructions online since the included instructions are worthless  At best the device only shows up for a couple seconds to pair and always fails  but it takes several tries to get it to show up as a option  Tried using NFC to pair and it fails every time as well  Worked over WiFi without problems  but the Bluetooth seems dead  Will be returning 
Worst piece of high tech gadgetry  Did not work  No HDMI interface  I have 150mbs connection and my network uses latest technology interface  And yet constant pixelation and dropped connections  Don t bother with this  Virtually no tech support either  Simply said    it s terrible  I d give it zero stars but the review module doesn t give me that option 
This product is easy to set up and it works great  High quality picture from anywhere 
Have this radio installed in my car and I love it  I have seen a lot of people complain about Apple CarPlay in general because it doesn t support a lot of apps  What I have discovered is that it may not support apps like Waze but it still allows you to use it and hear the audio over the speakers while still listening to your favorite music  Which is fine for me as I have my phone mounted high on the dash 
This is a great portable speaker  Great sound and functionality
I added this ram to my Rig  I now have 24GB  The fastest thing I ve ever seen 
Awesome  Bumps hard and replaced my 20 year old SONY system  Owned it for a couple of months already  No issues 
AWESOME    AWESOME    AWESOME    AWESOME    AWESOME   
I highly recommend this keyboard if you have a Surface Pro 3  It makes the experience like new again  Plus the keyboard feels really solid compared to the old one 
Great product  working perfectly  Installed on my old cpu as as an upgrade 
Great speaker  Love the sound great bass and love that it can charge your phone too
I knew phones had fingerprint unlock options and I use them  but I had no idea they had them on the keyboards for the Surface Pro s  It makes it so easy to log into your laptop and secure  
This is my third remote in 7 years  love all of them and like having the latest one  I have a 11 device theatre and all connected to this one remote  Awesome 
These headphones are comfortable  sound great and can be used to talk on iPhone  I can lounge on the deck and no longer be choked by a wire 
I have an older computer  and could not connect to 5g  with this I can
I purchased this wall mount this weekend and got a really great deal on it  It took about an 1 hour to install and comes with easy directions to mount  Taking measurements probably takes the longest  full tilt and extention of tv   perfect for different angle s in the home  love my new 70 inch 
This hotspot is awesome and stays charged for a long time 
Purchased for my son in college who is a software engineer major and highly recommended
The keyboard and touch pad are big upgrade over Pro 3 one  The fingerprint reader works wonderfully with Windows 10 Hello login  Takes less than a second to wake up and recognize  Highly recommend  Don t get it for SP4 since that has Hello capable camera 
Got this for my parents who are not  technologically advanced   They have had some problems getting used to it  but now they love it 
Terrific television  Very easy to set up and get started  Great picture  Internet connection was a breeze  I was a little confused at first about how to access the apps but eventually figured it out  All works quite well  I love Samsung products and own many of them  2 TVs  a Blu Ray player  2 smartphones  a refrigerator  and a microwave 
Amazing picture and slick looking tv  Lightweight and just the right size  Price was a steal too 
Great TV for any home or office  Samsung makes awesome products 
I really Love my new Samsung Tv Awesome picture it was easy to set up Wonderful Salesperson very nice helpful He really understood what I wanted and the price was perfect This is the first time I have ever bought a tv from Best Buy Thank You Best Buy You are Fantastic and Awesome                
This touchscreen works great  Especially in coordination with apple products because of the apple car play feature  Also makes hands free callin extremely easy 
I love this unit because I can watch my home TV stations anywhere  Catch any of the local sports teams  news  etc   Only slight complaint is the sounds sometimes will make crackling noise  Not often but does happen occasionally  Other than that this has been one of the best things I have ever purchased 
Well    I used it as a gift  And my friend loves it  Hooked it up to his TV and says its amazing the quality of the sound  Totally pleased 
Great sony product with good power to run the mids for the boat 
Would recommend this stereo  it has all the features Bluetooth etc  
I ve had several sets of outdoor speakers over the years  but these are the the best sounding speakers I ve ever had  Great full sounding response from lows to highs  clean detail  Hard to believe that much sound comes out of that small a speaker 
These are AWESOME    I spend a lot of time on my deck and enjoy listening to several different genres  The music is clear and crisp from High to Bass  I replaced 2 of 4 Sonance Marine speakers that I have had for over 10 years  I turned off the other 2 Sonance and just have the 2 DT speakers pumping out the tunes  Friends and party guests have been very impressed  as well 
Would recommend them to anyone who needs speakers for the vehicle
Awesome speakers
I recommend these speakers  Good sound  Good quality 
The speakers exceeded my expectations  they sound great and look good 
These speakers are amazing  I bought a pair and my back yard sounds amazing  It like a theatre 
These speakers are great  Much better than the factory speakers in my truck  Not too much bass which is good for my small p  u cab 
This is the best  JBL SPEAKERS speakers sound great and fit perfect  Great replacement speakers 
Very good price and quality  Bought all Alpine this time and it worked out well 
Was looking for a alternative speaker for my Harley Davidson these rock can hear the music clearly at 90 mph very very happy with these speakers
Debated between this and re BOSE environmental speakers  I went to Best Buy and listened to them  So glad I got these  Best quality and worth the extra money 
My family loves our new speaker that comes integrated with Alexa voice control  It has awesome sound with deep bass good for listening any type of music  It is very convenient that the speaker comes integrated with Alexa  Very easy to set up  just download Ultimate Ears app and follow instruction  During the setup  it suggested speaker software update which I did and found no issue  To use Alexa with the speaker  you need to use an Amazon account and Ultimate Ear offer free trial period for Amazon Music Unlimited  We did not encounter any issue giving Alexa commands even while playing loud music  The microphone works very well at detecting voice command  It is great that more and more devices are made waterproof and this device has this great feature  Hate seeing a good device getting damaged due to splashed water  I don�t plan to use this speaker near a pool but It will be placed on my kitchen�s island counter where water or liquid splash may accidentally occur  The Ultimate Ears website show an image that the speaker can even be used in the shower or the pool  You may even shower with Alexa playing your favorite songs The speaker is a hard casing but with a coat of rubber like material with will help in getting a strong grip on the device when transporting  The battery life is great and got the additional accessory for even easier charging  The power up charging dock accessory is a great addition to get to complete for the speaker To conclude  my entire house loves this new speaker and I would recommend it because of its awesome sound  this to any home 
I absolutely love this speaker  Sony doesn t let you down with the sound and the bass  This is a great speaker to have at home or on the go  Will buy another one but probably the bigger one for even bigger sound 
Awesome speaker  The speaker has amazing sound and bass 
great loud speaker for the price  the lights are a plus lol
If anything about music tht I love is the Bluetooth speaker   this has great quality of sound nd a good bass  I m having fun with the extra bass button which I always have on  I use it when I m on the go I listen to the radio with it or listen to my playist  This is a great speaker that I would recommend my friends to use 
It s really loud it s not just a quiet speaker  it also lights up 
Perfect for outdoor listening  This speaker has great sound and long battery life 
this is a great speaker i would def recommend to anyone looking for a bluetooth speaker
This is the third  different Bluetooth speaker that I have purchased  The sound quality whether inside or outside is amazing  The battery lasts for many hours and is quick to charge  My 13 year old son uses it day and night  I m extremely happy with this purchase 
This speaker is great  Loud and love the pulsing light 
This thing rocks  I want for the jbl key chain and saw this on sell for  100 and it is amazing and has a cool light show and strobe light 
This little speaker really kicks  I really like the ability to connect more than one speaker to the same signal 
Bought it for work and it had a nice volume height
JBL has always put out a good product  These headphones are no exception  Awesome sound  wireless  and adjustable with the app  What more could you want 
I would definitely recommend these headphones  The sound quality is amazing and the fit is very comfortable 
This speaker is loud  From the tech specs  the speaker has a max output of 93 decibels  which is a 40% increase  can I tell if it is 40% louder  not sure but I can be a good 30 50 feet and have no problems hearing the speaker when I compared it to other Bluetooth speakers that I had  For me the sound reaches everywhere in my back yard and my back yard is about a half acre  It has 360 coverage and it really didn t matter where I was in my back yard  the music sounded great from all angles  It sounds very clear and doesn t have that muddy sound you hear on other speakers when you turn up the volume all of the way  Wifi is rated at 330 feet for wifi and 150 for Bluetooth  I could reach a signal anywhere in my yard and I had a solid Bluetooth connection from 35 feet or so  No drop outs and the sound was great  Battery life is good  One thing I like is that the charger is wireless charging dock so I could really charge the speaker anywhere I went and it gave it a nice base to keep off the table  The battery is rated for 16 hours and I got close to that  but I was near a strong wifi signal and I kept the volume level at about half  I am not sure what happens to the battery life if it is not near a strong wifi signal  but battery life does take a hit if you play at max levels  Alexa is built in so you get hands free access to music services such as Amazon music  iHeartRadio and TuneIn  It looks like Pandora and Deezer will work in the near future  You get access to other Alexa services such as news  weather  auidiobooks  voice control for IoT devices  general questions and 25 000 Alexa commands  Set up is through a new UE app which connects your wifi network and links you Amazon account for the Alexa functions  Since the speaker is WiFi capable  the speaker will get updates quickly for Alexa functions  One of the benefits about being connected to wifi is now your music won t stop when someone is calling you  The Pros More durable and portable version of the EchoMuch louder and clearer than an EchoSounds much clearer at loud levels  doesn t sound muddyIP67 water resistant  Alexa is always listening no more having to press a button Some Cons There is no head phone jack  I know not everyone uses one and a speaker is typically so everyone can hear it  but some people will want the earphone access  Can t link older UE speakers and for now you can only play music through one Megablast at a time  Right now only Amazon Music  iHeartRadios and TuneIn are available for streaming music directly  Pandora and Deezer are set to be in the future  So if you use Apple music or Spotify you are out of luck  Can t make Alexa phone calls  I really like this speaker  one of the better sounding ones at full volume  If you need a loud  great sounding portable speaker that has Alexa functions built in so you can be hands free and is water resistant  this is the speaker for you 
Spent about 30 min to set up  Phoned customer service and they were no help  Was thinking about returning the speaker but I had just replaced my megeboom for megaboost  Next day spent about same amount of time after deleteing app and downloading the app like the previous day  Finally it sinked  Would have given it a 5 Star it it weren�t the fact of difficulty setting up   Need to fix the app or you will have alot of unhappy customers 
These are great outdoor speakers  The sound is awesome and they are built well  I especially like the strong base sound and solid mounting brackets 
This system has great sound quality  When I originally purchased it  I expected it to be average at best because of how inexpensive it is  However  my assumption was wrong  Best  135 I have ever spent on speakers 
Wanted outdoor speaker for sound and tv  Has good low end for an outdoor speaker 
Was looking to replace my stock speakers on my 16  Road Glide Special  and after reading many reviews I opted to try these out  and by no means have I been disappointed  Yes  they need to be broke in  I am currently running them off my head unit 25watts but will soon run them off the JL Audio 280  4 amp that I have  Crystal clear highs  and nice bass plus do not distort at high levels   
Great value for these headphones  I bought these during daily deals for  49  It was well worth it 
Great range  it s compact  and better sound quality  I certainly recommend this to users on or off budget 
This thing really has incredible sound for its size  Seriously amazing That was the good now here�s the bad  Previous models supported �Party Mode� which is using more than 1 speaker at a time  My intention was to buy 4 for around the pool for a more surrounded  richer sound but they no longer incorporate party mode into the device  I�m so confused as to why they would do this  I feel they have gone backwards in technology and this will cost Logitech sales 
The Best Tape on the market besides HD  When i got my sony camera  i got these and i clearly made the right choice for tapes  GET THESE IF YOU HAVE A MINIDV CAMERA 
perfect for throwing in my bag  going down to the beach    
Great sound for my patio use  covers 400 Square feet 
Awesome sound  bass etc  Blocks outside noise very well  Great in the gym 
Geek Tech came to our house to help determine our needs  Recommended this product    Using to hear music 
I went to bestbuy to buy a bose color 2  But I listened to the Sony and the bose wasn t even close i gladly paid a little more for the Sony the sound is expansive and just the right amount of base and if near wifi I can load up Sony app and play music through wifi instead of Bluetooth 
The buttons on the headphones are in an awkward spot
The quality of the sound stays true even at full blast 
These Yamaha speakers sound great in my tv room  Incredible surround sound  If you love movies you will definitely want these 
They have better sound then my friends Bose speaker I am happy that I listened to the best buy sales rep who told me that the speakers are made with Kevlar and not paper like the Bose speakers  Great great sound 
This headphone set has great sound  deep bass  and very good noise isolation 
This is my first set of JBL earphones and I have not been disappointed  They produce beautiful sound with a perfect amount of base  They are comfortable when I wear them to watch movies at night  I wasn t sure I would like the white color but I wanted something different than traditional black  I am glad I got the white  They are very well made and I expect to be using them for a long time 
We have experience with a Sling500  This M2 is simpler and more straightforward  Instead of continuing to pay crazy money to Directv to watch our favorite NFL team from afar  we bought an Over the air antenna  a cheap Homework HW150PVR  and this Slingbox M2 and set it up at a house in Wisconsin  We can now watch Milwaukee TV all the way in San Diego  Total cost  250  less than a single season of Sunday Ticket  Go Packers 
This deck worked out perfectly for my daughters car to enable blue tooth connectivity 
Really good price for the size and functionality of this TV
This is a great product and easy to setup  Really enjoy watching games anywhere 
Formerly 6 remotes    now one      awesomeset up can be a little difficult but you get used to it and fine tune to your liking pretty quickly shape is a little funny kind of wants to slide out of your hand with all the weight at the bottom and tapered towards the top whatever  i like it mainly because i cant stand digging through a pile of remotes
I bought these subs due to the size of the magnet and the total wattage not knowing what I was getting into    needless to say I bought two of them and a hifonics zuse 1200d that maxes at 2400w at 1 ohm    these really pump in my jeep   I built a custom ported box to fit the specs of the subs and to equalized the sound through my 96 Cherokee and ill say it beats harder than the set of kicker comp vr s I used to have  I blew 4 mtx 12 s that were in the trunk of a car away   The right box and these subs pound but remember they require 1 5 cf if its a ported box 
Why haven t you bought this It s loud  amazing base  great functions  Love the light shows with the beat of the music  Other sound systems cost way more and do not have as clean of sound  DJ functions ok 
Good quality  like the lights n stuff  Wish it was waterproof
Perfect upgrade to factory OEM speakers  These have plenty of highs and great amount of bass  I would definitely purchase these again in the future 
Logitech remote software has always been a little buggy  Replacing the 1000i with the new Ultimate should have been a lot easier    but 3 hours of cursing over software that wont do what it says     fun  Eventually it worked and the configurations I had for the old remote went across to the new one and now life is good  The Ultimate is an awesome remote and I would recommend highly  Just don t expect a 10 minute setup   especially if you are migrating from an earlier Logitech remote 
My entire home theatre and audio center is now controlled with this one remote  For the price it was well worth it 
Awesome remote  Program it to do almost anything  Small  fits in your hand and comes with a charger 
Easy setup and takes little time to learn how to use  My wife loves the one button touch to turn everything she needs on 
I used to have a harmony one remote and upgraded to this one  Logitech has done a nice job streamlining the setup feature  They only complaint I have is with setting up and editing favorites  Moving your favorite channels around is quite cumbersome 
Great remote for a great price  Controls everything I need   
This remote puts juggling 4 remotes to just watch tv in the past 
This remote said it was used but we don t think it was  which was a pleasant surprise  I love everything about it  It was well worth the money 
I was looking for a new remote and had previously purchased a logitech remote  I was pleased with that one so why not go for another   The guided setup on my laptop was a breeze that even most computer illiterate could manage it   I love the touch screen that not only shows a list of my favorite channels but also has an onscreen volume  mute  rewind  ff  pause and so much more   The only thing I don t like is unless you bookmark the link to the setup screen  it s nearly impossible to find again  
This remote system is awesome  My wife has easily learned how to use it  which is a big deal 
I have multiple brands of AV equipment  and this remote is very easy to program  It links the correct pieces for the desired activity  I highly recommend this remote 
This is an awesome remote very easy to use and user friendly would recommend it for all your smartphone needs one remote controls everything
I got this as a gift for my father in law and he loves it  Every time I see him he talks about how much he enjoys it  He wants a new tv now to enjoy his remote more 
Awesome battery life  One remote to control everything  Super easy to program   Use  definitely would reccomend a Harmony if you don t already have one  
Easy to program and use  Excellent range  Much improved over the earlier models 
Great device  Fits my hand nice  medium   touch screen with the favorite channels identified is a nice feature  Easy setup  if you already have a Harmony device extra easy setup  Great buy if you need a new universal remote 
I bought this remote to replace my 7 year old Harmony One  I like the favorites tabs that you can add  No more typing the numbers 
I hated my cable company bulky remote control but I love my new Logitech remote It has a nice touch screen that shows your favorite channel icons and channel labels  It is fully programmable and very easy to use  You don�t have to think about channel numbers just look for your favorite channel icon touch the screen and there you go I know that it is  150 remote but for me it was worth every penny

I have never written a review before  but this remote deserves one  We had four remotes to watch TV or watch a movie   And now just one  It is AWESOME  I was worried the set up would be complicated or not work  However Harmony s web site was very easy to follow and simply walks you through the whole set up step by step  It walks you through the set up of activities and your favorite TV Channels  If I can do it anyone can I was so impressed that it motivated me to write this review I would highly recommend this remote   
I love the fact I can use one remote to turn everything on  I love that it s touchscreen and how it gives a lot of different options 
I purchased the Harmony Ultimate Universal Remote in order to combine multiple remotes for multiple devices into one  It was very easy to setup and even easier to use  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great universal remote
Love the remote  It has all the features that I would need 
The remote was delivered as promised  The remote was easy to configure and was able to transfer all settings easily from my old remote 
THIS REMOTE IS AWESOME  THE HARDEST PART ABOUT IT WAS THE SETUP  IT STILL TAKE ME A MINUTE TO REMEMBER HOW TO NAVIGATE BACK AND FORTH THRU MY DEVICES  BUT IT WORKS REALLY WELL 
Awesome Radio  Its Also 1800 Watts Not 1600 Watts    Sounds Really Good    Bluetooth Is Perfect    Colors are very Catchy    Sound Quality Is Better Than Expected    Bass Could Have Been A Bit Better But All In All    I Recommend This Radio For Party People  People Who Loves Loud Music And Also Perfect For A Surround Sound To Tv   
I have no issue at all  The price was great and it works as described  Set up is easy and simple  Its also small so it does not take up alot of space but the sound it produces is BIG 
I was very skeptical about spending 300 on a remote  but I have to say that it is an awesome product and Harmony offers amazing support  Some of the functions initially were not working properly and I emailed Harmony  they made adjustments to my account  I re synced it  and some of the issues were resolved but not all  So  another email to them  another adjustment by them  another sync by me  and shazam  all was fixed  I certainly recommend this for anyone with multiple devices 
the radio is the best product than I bought in my life
Love the YouTube button on the remote    The user interface on the tv is the best  
Awesome gaming mouse  rechargeable and very versatile  im going to buy a second one 
I bought this mouse for my fiance  I had absolutely no idea what to buy  so I looked at reviews online  My fiance loved it  the big selling point was that it was wireless 
I really like the shape and it works really well when I play games 
built in temperature sensor  runs at 2 4 ghz ddr4  and very affordable to use for upgrades 
This is a very user friendly remote  This is a great gift for a man cave  The touch screen is wonderful and being able to set your sports stations and any other favorites makes this product worth every penny 
So it s been a little over a year since I purchased this keyboard for my Surface Pro 3  I purchased this type cover over the regular one so that I can take advantage of all that Windows hello has to offer  The island style key spacing was a massive improvement over the Pro 3 cover and the trackpad has a nice texture  The trackpad this time around is a lot more useable for two finger scrolling and pinch to zoom  All the buttons are where you want them to be and the svelte makes it feel premium  The type cover does has its annoyances however  Firstly  the fingerprint scanner doesn t always work when used to unlock the device  often times I would have to disconnect the type cover and reconnect it for it to work  I don t know if this is a software problem regarding the Surface itself or if it s a problem with Windows 10  Maybe a system update for either the Surface Pro 3 or type cover could fix this  the other issue is that when the type cover is folded back the device takes longer to wake up  Interesting because my older Pro 3 cover didn t have this problem  So maybe a software update for the Surface Pro 3 is necessary to address this issue  other than those problems its a solid keyboard 
I love this keyboard  Sure its expensive but what in life worthwhile isn t The feel of the Alcantara is sooooo silky and luxurious  The gray color compliments the surface pro 4 nicely  I really like the backlit keys of the type keyboard and the tactile feel of the keys The keyboard attached instantly to the surface and recognized it immediately Microsoft really did a wonderful job with this keyboard  It did have a weird chemical smell when I opened it   but that disappears after about a week  Overall  I would highly recommend even for the extra money  this type keyboard if you are trying to decide between the colors of the other ones 
I am loving my new Surface and this keyboard makes the Surface that must more user friendly  I love being able to fingerprint log in instead of typing in the password each time and being able to adjust the lighted background of the keyboard is really nice  I love the feel and text of the keyboard itself and I am extremely happy with the quality 
This is the best Keyboard I ve purchased for my Surface Pro as of yet  It is backwards compatible with the Surface Pro 3 and the fingerprint reader works decent with Windows 10  Sometimes the Surface Pro doesn t see the fingerprint reader when you go to login but it s easily corrected by disconnecting and reconnecting the keyboard  Outside of that  I ve had no issues with it and like the feel  layout much better than the older generation keyboards  The touchpad is great as well and is a nice change from the previous generation keyboard 
To buy a type cover if you own a surface pro is a no brainer   you should  period The keyboard is really responsive  comfort to type on  and very thin  Plus the design that works like a cover to the surface pro is really good The question then is if one should by this model   with Fingerprint ID  I personally did  and do not regret it The Fingerprint ID works really well  and is really responsive  Logging in windows with it is super easy and fast  the downside is that I did not find apps that i normally use that take advantage of the fingerprint id   granted that I did not actively search for them  rather than just checked if the ones I use would benefit  It yet to be seen  though  if the more computers and tablets have this reader  the more developers will add this function  I would love to use it for loggin in my internet accounts for example Anyway  this purchase is worth the price  but keep in mind that you might be paying extra for a future benefit more than anything 
Has the finger print recognition which is so much faster  Great product 
I got a Surface Pro 3 bundle with a keyboard and pen  I purchased both the Surface Pro 4 keyboard and the new pen with the 4 tips  The keyboard with the fingerprint reader is very convenient and the touch and feel of the keys are superior to the bundled keyboard 
Pretty nice keyboard quick responsive fingerprint reader  Should ve been included since the beginning 
So easy to attach to the computer   love that iwhen it is connected it does not disconnect easy
Mine lasted a year  i use it more than 8hr hours a day  But a keyboard this price point normally lasts decades
Works great with my S5  I keep it in the car for emergencies 
It s a pretty awesome remote  My husband programmed it and all in all its fairly easy to use
I recently mounted these speakers in game    theater room  We wanted speakers that were ceiling mounted so they were out of the way and not noticable  These speakers were super easy to install  other than running wires which has nothing to do with the speakers themselves   Each pair came with a template for cutting the hole  had pop out legs that held them in place while you finished mounting them  and spring loaded speaker wire connectors that made connections fast and easily accomodated 14 gauge speaker wire  or banana clips   Once installed they fit flush and are virtually invisible with no annoying emblems or tags on the covers  The sound from these speakers is fantastic  You really get a theater like surround sound experience with four of these in the ceiling 
I never care to pen down for a review but these headphones are exceptional    Love them right from the day one    Very    Very happy with the purchase     
Great headphones for a great price  I love the fact that they are wireless and noise cancelling 
Great stereo sound  clarity  bass and comfort  Very happy with it 
I bought these headphones to use at work I m a landscaper and the noise cancellation feature has been amazing  I can take calls and haven t had any problems  a great buy
The JBL Everest Elite 700 s are the best of 3 wireless headphones  They are also the the most expensive of the three  My other pairs are the Bose wireless and the Klipsch wireless  All 3 are comfortable  The JBL and Bose are over the ear and the Klipsch is on the ear  The JBL is the best at noise canceling  Also the App for controlling ambient noise levels and the equalizer is pretty cool  It also let s you know how much battery you have left The JBL does need to be adjusted from time to time for comfort  but that s not a big deal  The battery last the day and charges up pretty quickly  Just be sure you actually turn them off before putting them in the case or you will be disappointed when trying to use them  They are supposed to have an auto off feature  but I did find my headphones at 10% after a full charge and in the case for 2 days  Maybe the battery doesn t hold a charge for very long  I figured it was in the box at the store for longer than that and was fine out of the box when I tried them that first time before their first full charge  Guess I ll have to experiment a bit more While the headphones are AWESOME   the case is lacking  For the price of the headphones you would think that you could get a hardshell case  The case should have pockets that can store the audio and charging cables securely  Also the provided case is difficult to carry with NO strap or handle  It is possible to inadvertently turn on the headphones while carrying them 
These are the best headphones I ve ever owned  They block sound great and sound great  Battery life is pretty good with them as well 
Love it  Doesn t have Bluetooth but works great with my iphone
I got this gift for my husband last father s day  He loves the gift  He said   You did good babe   Misson accomplished 
I put this in my bathroom due to be waterproof and synced it with my Amazon Echo  I can now hear the music while taking a shower  Plus if I need to I can unplug it and take it with me to the pool and not worry about it getting wet
I was very surprised for the price the sounds the speakers had awesome     
Great radio easy to use and understand love this radio so much great sound quality and amazing how easy it hooks to iPhone 
I honestly love this radio system  Love the apple CarPlay 
I bought this for my surface Pro 3  All I can say is that this is an awesome keyboard   gives the feel of a full keyboard with the keys spaced apart and the fingerprint is simply awesome  Recognizes your fingerprints very fast and I wish other windows applications will utilize this feature in the near future just like other iOS apps on my iPhone
The ambient noise filter is great  Happen to get these on sale  Would recommend  Phone app is another great feature 
This radio has awesome features for the money   Highly recommended    
Great drive for my purposes  I replaced a WD Green drive with this one for media storage and streaming  Has been working great 
A Consumer Reports Best Buy   Recommended desktop  Got it for a great price on sale   BONUS   
Fast at transferring files  capable of working smoothly with multiple programs open  Love that it s big enough to make some future upgrades  Working perfectly for me  Great with gaming on Wow 
It s Perfect for traveling it s a must have  Easy to charge 
This thing increased my downloads to over 900mbps  So fast
This speaker is extraordinarily easy to set up and produces tremendous sound  The bass is crisp and deep  The overall sound is very good for the price  I plan on buying another and connecting the two to have sound throughout the house 
This little speaker packs a punch  with great sound  easy connectivity  and small enough to fit nicely in a daypack  So far  I haven t had the opportunity to test the battery life  due to the fact that it s mostly used in my garage or shop  and usually leave it plugged in to a convenient outlet while playing  Base boost is exactly as advertised and plenty of it  You can definetly hear the difference  Set up wasn t a problem because a free Geek Squad appointment included in the purchase didn t take 5 minutes to complete  Bada bing   bada boom    and out the door with portable tunes blarring from my new XB30  In case you re wondering  the XB30 is WAY more speaker than the XB20 and a LOT less expensive than the XB40  Tried out the in store demos on all the other brands as well and this little jewel just had the BEST sound of all for a GREAT price     of course  I bought it on SALE   
This speaker is the absolute best sounding speaker for it s size  great bass response and sound quality overall Would definitely buy more of them  have two now and want two more 
I have been researching Over the Ear bluetooth headphones for some time  I work in an IT environment  if I m not on conference calls then I m listening to music to drown out surrounding noise while I work all day at a computer  Since I have to go back and forth from call to music I typically use the ear buds that came with my phone  that have a mic I may be the only one  but earbuds get sooo uncomfortable after hours of use  I tried a Jawbone for about a day  can t do the bluetooth in ear either  Over the ear BT headphones prices vary so much and can get very expensive on top of that I don t know that I would like them   I bought these because they were cheap as a test run    After about 4 hours at work I LOVE them  They drown out a majority of outside noise without completely blocking all sound   Which is good if someone is calling your attention  Music sounds WAY better than I would have imagined for the price  Of course BT headphones in general have a way to go   these are great  So far so good on conference calls  other callers can t even tell I m on a headset   That s better than my earbud mic   If you are hesitant to buy a bluetooth over the ear headphone set  start with this one  I will likely upgrade to higher quality set eventually     but for now I m 100% satisfied  They are comfortable to wear all day long  Also not to mention NO WIRES The only slight flaw is they are smaller than your typical skull candy hesh or beats over the ear set  They fit my head  ears perfectly  but if you can you should look at them in the store or google pictures of them on someone   to make sure you like the way they look 
Charges fairly and shows how much percentage is with light
This is a great back for hiking around  It is also great for extras 
I have this backpack for 8 months now  and I am loving it  I can cary one DSLR  three lenses  charger  memory cards  extra batteries  cables  one full size tripod and a small one  When it s needed I can also put my action camera whit accessories and lights  I have been traveling with this backpack and I can almost say that it is a PERFECT backpack 
It has plenty of space for my camera and zoom lenses  I love that the zipper is not accessible from the outside so that when I travel I don t get my camera stolen  It is very durable and padded 
It holds canon 5D markIII  24 70 f  2 8 II  and 70 200 f  2 8 II lenses comfortably  Very well made 
Great wall mount took me awhile about 6 hours but I also brought power and signal plugs to be hidden behind as well But everything went great  The kit was awesome even more adjustable than I thought it would be I will buy this for my next one I put up 
Hands down  this is the best bluetooth speaker I ve heard  Since everyone s listening tastes differ  you mileage may vary  There s more than enough bass  tight and slightly  punchy  that you can feel  and the mids  highs are more pronounced and crisp  And  with any speaker  the quality that goes in is reflected in the quality that comes out  So  your Spotify extreme downloads will sound better than the music ripped from Napster in 2002  There s more than enough headroom to overwhelm a small  12x12  room but a large room wouldn t be a problem  either  As it s winter in my locale  I haven t tested outdoor results but fidelity will obviously be lost  as is the case with any speaker  absent any reflective surfaces Yeah  it s a fairly large speaker but I d have no problem putting it into a carry on to accompany me on a vacation  Solid build and finish I put this up against BB s standard aisle fare and it really stood out for me with its superior sound  I walked into the store expecting to buy the large Bose Revolve  but didn t like its sound characteristics nearly enough  That may be the right speaker for you so take the opportunity to do an in store listen before purchasing  The other UE offerings just didn t have the clarity and sound I wanted although others can be paired up for stereo sound which would make a difference  In the end  I just wanted one speaker and this was it And  if you want a decent carry case  search Amazon for telephoto camera lens bags  I think mine  JJC  was about  12 and carries the charge cable and wall wart with the speaker with ease  What can be improved Wi fi connectivity is spotty  For whatever reason it stopped connecting to my primary wi fi network but has no problem with the guest one  Go figure The microphones aren t nearly as sensitive as my Alexa devices  In fact  I have to raise my voice enough that other devices pick up the requests  too Bluetooth doesn t autoconnect in the app  It s just a couple clicks but I can be listening to music  open the app  and it won t find the speaker until I select it in the menu  Dumb The recharge port is kinda  in a dumb place  on the bottom  protected by a threaded cover  Makes sense for durability but I m sure more than one owner will lose his  her cover or threaded bolt UE could stand to add an EQ setting in the app but I m running EQ Pro on my Android and that launches automatically so NBD  Still  it would be nice if a speaker manufacturer had the forethought to allow customizing its products  sound without going third party  Again  just a nit but I like messing with the sound Good luck with your search and happy listening 
the best part of this backpack is its all on the backside  so there is no risk of it ever being open or falling out  Also fits one to two cameras with a couple lenses 
This remote has made things so much easier  Easy to program and works with all my components seamlessly 
Awesome adapter  Very easy to use  just plug it in  connect to your network and Done  Great connection and speed  Very pleased and recommend to anyone looking for a wireless adapter 
I ve had this adapter for about 2 months and I am amazed at just how fast it is  My speed test are over 100mbs every time I run one  Awesome    
This keyboard works like a charm  The keys feel very natural and easy to use  I love how the keyboard has a backlight under the keys  This is a great feature to have  Perfect working accessory for the Surface Pro 4 
It was hard to figure out how to do all the program setup but once I figured it out and use one remote instead of 5 remote it s so much easier but sometime pain in the butt
Bought these for a trip to Florida and can t tell you how impressed I am with these  Blocked out the noise from the plane and was able to enjoy the movie  BT feature is nice however only downfall is you cannot be hardwired and use bt as an option at the same time  Well worth the investment  
This is the best RF remote I ve owned   EVER  It s capabilities exceed what I expected 
Couldn t be happier with my purchase  completes the set 
Although not significantly faster  my Mac is able to operate with many more programs and windows open without overheating or compromising my current processing speed  Highly recommended 
Amazing and easy to install and amazing sound for the price good bass and good clear sound buy them now
Awesome Sony blue tooth speaker the best next bose 
Deep Bass  thee best bluetooth speaker ever       
Excellent ram at a great price  Installation was quick and easy
gotta say really impressed with this keyboard  finger print security option is nice and very fast to recognize my print just as fast as my iphone 6s plus
Great bluetooth speaker  Bought 2 for surround with sony sound bar 
Great design that fits in your pocket  Charges devices with no issues
Great product exactly what I was looking for  works well 
Great remote  Looks great  Definitely worth the money
I can t believe de difference from the factory to this set  It is night and day    Love the product 
I have had several Harmony remotes and this one is just as goods as them all  Great product easy to use and program  
I read every review  I went with B W reputation and they definitely deliver  I love these cans  The sound from these are so good you don t want to take them off  The fit was good for me  Took a week of wearing to break in  My favorite headphones and worth every penny 
I was waiting for the JBL CB100 for both iphone and android but they kept delaying it since March 2016  JBL just pushed to August now  Got this Alpine instead and couldn t be happier  Installed myself in 2012 mazda 6  Works great especially with native apple apps  Love the clean interface and simple menu buttons  Only negative is there is no bluetooth and have to plug in my iPhone to connect to my phone  I dont mind though because it charges my phone when i plug in 
If you dont have a iPhone than dont even buy this  I have a iPhone 6 and this alpine is awesome  Wish it would come with a remote like Alpine used to give 
So I bought this after being annoyed with my old UE boom box that didn t have enough bass  I wanted something louder and I got this  It was  117 and I think it s totally worth it  The colors that this speaker changes are quite cool  The Sony app lets you set the mood for the speaker and the music sounds so well  The sound is clear and no distortion follows  The bass is a thumping one  It s much louder than my ueboombox  Sony is improving quite well and I m impressed with this device  I do notice there s a difference when you play music from Spotify vs Apple Music it s so much louder and deeper  To test this speaker you have to play many different genres  Coldplay sounds amazing and so does Travis Scott or Rihanna  A song with much production can make this speaker travel  I played confident by Demi Lovato while I showered and I could hear it over the shower and my grandma complained about the music being so loud  This is a very good speaker  Don t get the  130 jbl speaker I had it before this one and I returned it because of no bass  This speaker proved my return to be a good one 
So much easier to use than a regular tablet touch screen  Snaps on and off with ease
The BEST outdoor speakers out there  After buying and returning brands like Bose  Logan s and Polk finally found Definitive Technology  They blow the competition away with crisp sound and great bass  Turn them up and WOW 
The finger print scanner works great and the keyboard lights are awesome 
The sound is good  I like the extra bass and phone calls feature 
These are super  Sound great for wireless surround  Easy hook up with song pal 
This is a great loud speaker  Bluetooth capability w the lights gets my kids home party started  Love the quality 
This is the best Bluetooth speaker I have seen or heard  and also connects via wifi  Definitely worth the cash 
This remote is awesome in the beginning I was like ahh why did I buy such a expensive remote but after using it and seeing all it can do I m very satisfied
This remote was so easy to set up  And once set up the response time is so much better than my older harmony remote and a little more forgiving on pointing it at my entertainment center  It s a solid buy when on sale 
This remote works great and is super simple to set up and use
This speaker packs a punch and the price is well marked  
Works great  Would recommend to anyone that likes music without many commercials 
I love the sony extra bass speaker  It price is worth it
It worked  was great quality  I wish it was waterproof though 
i have 4 aw5500 on my outdoor patio I replaced my sony center channel with aw6500 wow so I have 4 aw5500 1 aw6500 for a center channel pairs up real nice and has nice base sound  big sound at low level I am also running a 10 inch sony sub nice clean sound happy happy
I would give zero stars if I could  This remote promises great things  but fails miserably to deliver  I purchased two of these remotes  and had to return both of them because neither of them would sync with my computer  I have been a dedicated Harmony user for the past four years  see my glowing review of the Harmony 1100  and have NEVER had so much difficulty setting up a universal remote  The sync would hang without finishing  or wouldn t start up at all  and the setup failed to recognize a couple of my devices even though I was absolutely certain I had entered the correct model numbers  I am considerably tech savvy  and could understand if this problem had occurred with only one remote    but BOTH? ? ? Never again

I have nothing to complain about this remote  For my setup TV  cable box  AV receiver it works great  The vibration feedback with the short and long holds on the buttons takes some getting used to

Crystal clear sound quality  perfect reproduction  Second to nome construction 
I have owned and tried Sennheiser Momentum  P5  P3  Klipsch 4i  Etymotics  Grado s  Shure s  and more    Obvsoily these are a combination of in ear  open and closed headphones Bottom line   I have NEVER had my hands on ANY type of ear  headphone that sounded as good  nearly as beautifully made  and comfortable as these  I would be surprised if they don t wind up in MOMA in NYC like Movado s Sound Quality specifics   2nd to none instrument  voice separation with close but awesome soundstage  tight and appropriately strong bass  great mid range  unbelievable and again appropriate highs  again 2nd to none   many people claim you can hear new details with certain gear   with these OH MY YOU WILL  isolation is great while actively listening and does a great job of shielding sound from outsiders They are so efficient that my ipad and phone drive them as loud as I could bear   amazing for such large over the ear drivers If you love music and sound at it s best and love to get  lost  in it  I know of no better place on earth unless you are prepared to spend well into 4 digits The only downside    400 is a lot of money  especially for headphones  However  I can safely say they blow away anything in this price range and they are physically a work of art  Lastly  they smell beautiful  really  Other reviewers have described the smell similar to what the inside of a  Bentley  or  Rolls Royce   It seems crazy to say it but it is no exaggeration  really 
I bought this headphone primarily to be used with my notebook  very nice design but the sound could be better  it also produces a faint background noise and cuts off occasionally 
My second Harmony remote  I would prefer a real numeric keypad vs the on screen one  Aside from that this is a very nice remote  I wish the software was less wizard y 
Intuitive and easy to program like every Logitech remote  Compact size is a plus  The favorites feature is really good although reordering the channels is a little bit of a hassle  I am hopeful that the charging cradle will work for the long haul  My old 880 started have connection issues with the charging cradle after the fist year  Still the best remote on the market 
A great surround speaker system at a very affordable price  Not necessarily what you would set up in a banquet hall  but more than adequate for home use  Very well made  nice size  and the sound is awesome  Recommend this system to anyone looking to add satellites or upgrading their older system 
It does what I was expecting  Works great  Fast delivery  Only down is the cost of the app with no adds 
This produce was as advertised  It is fast and very quiet  I would recommend this computer 
Works like a charm and very responsive  Fingerprint reader great addition 
Easy to use   does exactly what it s supposed to do
I love this radio system  If you love your XM subscription  then you ll love this in your house or wherever you are  It is a must own 
Nice and loud no distortion  kenwood stereo and kicker amp
This control does it all  I am still learning what all it does  It sure makes it easy only using one controller instead of 4  
Works very well with my 42  Samsung  I plan on purchasing for my 60  in the living room as well 
We love to stream music  We spent about 2 hours reviewing all of the portable speakers in the store  We love the slideshow  We took this to the beach and kept it out of the sand 95% of the time  It s the best for the price  We also love the light show 
Apple integration is flawless  I love the way as soon as you plug up all apps work 
Provides great quality in sound and hours of music enjoyment 
Great product  I d give it 5 stars but to me it seems a bit pricey for what you get 
I upgraded from my older 900 which I loved  This remote has awesome new features  The only reason it gets 4 not 5 stars is the battery life  Fully charged I get 2 days before its dead 
This is the 3 Logitech remote I have purchased from Best Buy and this is the best one by far  Talk about feature packed 
PNY is always a safe bet for BIY project   the system will probably not come close to using it all but WTH that s part of the fun 
Got this to replace our aging Harmony 1  Works ok but the time keeps reverting to Western  I m in Hawaii  Annoying but I can live with it  It gets 3 stars because of horrible battery life and it looks like you can t replace the battery without a bunch of work  Sure miss the old one 
This is a replacement for a Harmony 650 and I was able to transfer the settings quickly and easily using Logitech s Harmony software I like having 50 favorite channels  we watch fewer so 50 is enough  and a charger so no more keeping 4 packs of AAA batteries on hand However  arranging the channels in order was a major pain in the butt but I was finally able to get them in order of networks followed by basic cable followed by premium cable  Other than that setup was easy 
My son was rebuilding a desktop and needed some new hardware  www BestBuy com had an excellent memory kit on hand for hassle free shopping  Simple safe packaging  easy to instill and no snags  All worked out like a Swizz watch and all is great  Thank you for having a good product 
I bought this keyboard solely because I liked how it felt in the store when I typed compared to the type cover I purchased with my Surface Pro 3 over a year ago  I d spent time typing on this one in the store and thought I knew what to expect  Boy was I wrong  First  yes   the keyboard is exponentially more comfortable and feels somehow faster than the older type cover  Second  WOW the trackpad  This is  by far  the smoothest and most perfectly tuned trackpad I have ever used  The default sensitivity for both movement and tap to click is perfect  Third  the fingerprint ID is more useful than I d expected  In addition to the Windows 10 functionality I already knew about  it also works as a login feature for my password manager and  I m sure  much more that I haven t discovered yet  Finally  let s talk about  cringe  lapability  The keyboard s magnetic attachment to the screen feels stronger and the whole keyboard feels more rigid and solid than my older type cover  The end result is a device configuration that very closely mimics the stable feeling of a decent laptop  Overall  this keyboard made my Surface Pro 3 new again  In short  this upgrade for my Surface Pro 3 works perfectly and offers improvements I wasn t expecting  I ll be honest and say that I almost never use my old touch cover anymore   I just didn t like it  This  however  I will use  It s one of those things I didn t realize I needed until I got it  If you re a Surface Pro 3 owner and you re looking for a way to refresh that system and make it feel new again   this works well 
The MEElectronic AirFi Bluetooth headphones are a product I would buy again and again  To start  you simply cannot beat the price of these headphones for the quality they provide  Second  the sound quality is excellent  I am a music junky and I have gone through dozens of headphones  but the sound quality on this pair would one of the best I ve come across so far  Mind you  I never spend more than  100 for a pair of headphones  I also love that these headphones feature a built in mic  control keys  and the option to use the provided 3 5mm stereo cable to connect to any headphone compatible device  Amazing  I also  love the colors and glossy plastic  but that s purely a cosmetic thing  They seem pretty durable too  but I wouldn t go making a habit out of slamming them onto the floor Now  the padding of the headphones makes for a pretty comfortable wearing experience  but they sometimes like to slide off my head when I look down or just headbanging to the beat  Also  I have noticed that the headphones become out of sync at times  usually I only notice this while watching Hulu or Netflix on my PC   but turning the headphones off and back on resolves this problem  Another very minor issue with these headphones is the lack of an  L  and  or  R  stamped on the either side of the headphones to indicate the proper placement of the speakers over your ears  Though I figured that the built in mic should point forward  which would mean the side with the buttons should be placed over your right ear All in all I am extremely happy with these headphones and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a set of Bluetooth headphones that fit a smaller budget 
The best thing is that the alarm doesn t ring constantly    It rings  shuts off  and lights the  warning   etc  light  Then we listen for the message 
I ve been using Harmony remotes for over 20 years  and I have not one complaint  The Ultimate One is my latest addition  I still use an older model  550  for my bedroom  but I ve programmed the Ultimate One to control both home theater systems  I really appreciate that you can make operation adjustments on the fly  e g   change the HDMI setting for a particular component  Highly recommend 
Excellent sound quality and powerful bass  My neighbor knocked on my door twice in one week to turn the bass off 
For reference  my set up consists of an LG Smart TV  a DirecTV HR 200 receiver  a Sony soundbar  subwoofer  a Chromecast  Xbox 360  PS3 and a Wii U  I wanted to consolidate the various remotes into one and make it stone simple for the kids  and me  to press a single button and have all the inputs and devices align themselves for use properly  TL  DR summary  this remote  and hub for the PS3  Wii U  does this easily  and I would recommend highly Wanted to write a review to help anyone out there  that like me  wasn t too sure if this was going to be a good purchase or not  There are some significantly negative reviews  and some are probably genuine  based on user s actual experiences  However  there also seems to be more than a few that are based solely on a misunderstanding or misuse of the product  If I can help clear any of that up and provide another perspective  I hope I can do so First of all  Logitech s legacy product naming conventions compared to the current Harmony line up  as of early 2016 on their website  can get confusing  The names One  Ultimate  Home and Touch can become frustrating when trying to figure out what is best for your remote control needs  Case in point  I purchased this Ultimate One IR remote  knowing full well that I d eventually need to add a hub to provide Bluetooth control for our Wii U and PS3  I ended up ordering the hub separately  only to find later that I could have ordered this Logitech 915 000237 Harmony Ultimate Home Touch Screen Remote for 15 Home Entertainment and Automation Devices  Black  and saved some money  Again  note that according to Logitech s current website  that package is no longer offered  but if you like this remote and think you ll need or use the hub  I d recommend this package  as best I can tell  it is the same remote but with the addition of the hub for less then the price of the two were you to buy them individually  like I did  Oh well Second  the Harmony compatibility site is pretty excellent  Just tell it the manufacturer and model number of your equipment and it will tell you pretty much everything you need to know  What can be controlled  what can t and which Harmony products you ll need  Comprehensive database of compatible devices  to say the least Third  much has been said of the MyHarmony desktop software  Overall  I thought it was fine  Relatively easy to use  but you can tell it s a work in progress  as it s not quite as slick and polished as the interface on the remote itself  However  while you may end up going in a couple of circles  the software does always seem to realize what changes you ve made and will ultimately guide you where you need to be  It seems smart enough to realize that some users may do things in a different order based on their specific hardware  and it catches up so to speak to ensure your remote and hub if you have one  are kept in sync  I don t think you need to be an expert to use it  but I could see where some on the lower end of the techno savvy scale might not understand or have difficulty  My overall feeling though  is that if you re considering this line of products in the first place  you ll be fine with the software Sidebar for a bit on the Harmony Home Hub  Logitech 915 000238 Harmony Home Hub for Smartphone Control of 8 Home Entertainment and Automation Devices The Ultimate One remote is infrared only  So  if you have any devices that require control via Bluetooth like my PS3 or Wii U  you ll need this Hub if you want to control them with the remote   You can apparently also use the smartphone app once you have the Hub  but I haven t tried that  and don t really have any intention either  Still  nice to know it s there   You add the Hub to your profile in the MyHarmony desktop software  and there are a couple of ways to do this  either by upgrading your remote with a hub  or by setting it up as a new Harmony device  but both methods will get you there  Again  the software will realize that installing the Hub as a new device  or upgrading the remote is the same thing  and will route you through the required steps regardless of how you do it  If you buy both  set up the remote first  then add the Hub  Once set up  the remote will have for example your activity named Play PS3 and will signal the Hub to provide the Bluetooth signal to power on the PS3  Works great Fourth  ergonomics and usability  Lot of talk about the ergos and usability of this remote  Have to say  I honestly find the negative reviews quite surprising  In use  this is one of the best pieces of consumer tech I ve ever purchased  Works exactly as promised and way  way more of a pleasure to use than a number of the reviews here make it out to be  A big part of this is the operation and behavior of the screen  It s not like your smartphone s screen prone to accidental brushes and taps  It takes an appropriately deliberate touch to activate anything  and each intentional press is confirmed by a nice little haptic feedback buzz  vibration  to let you know you what you wanted was selected Also  and why this is rarely mentioned is beyond me  but the screen defaults to a lock screen  Meaning it lights up  but won t register a touch or press until you swipe to unlock it  In use  let s say you re watching TV and the remote is just sitting there asleep  You get up to do something or want to pause or even record to your DVR using the hardware buttons  You can absolutely use those keys without inadvertently touching something on the screen  and the screen will remain locked out  There is apparently a setting where you can turn the lock screen feature off  but I m not sure why you would want to  as it completely removes the issue of interference by your hand  And again  it s not like an errant brush of the hand will cause an unwanted key selection anyway On top of that  the screen features a slick gestures screen that slides up from the bottom and allows you to pause  play  volume up and down  fast forward and rewind simply by sweeping your finger or tapping the screen without ever having to look down  Again  this too works exceptionally well  The gestures screen will persist too  meaning if you slide it up to activate it  then set the remote down and it goes back to sleep  as soon as you pick it up again  the gestures screen is still there  I find myself leaving that screen open most of the time  as it s truly simple and intuitive to use A lot has been made of how un ergonomic this remote is  and I just don t get that  at all  In use it works extremely well  and I really do not think Logitech committed any massive deign errors  Rather it seems very well thought out and super clever The Activities  as you set them up via the desktop application just plain work  It is fun to watch everything turn on and set themselves to the correct inputs  And even if for some reason they won t  the remote will guide you through how to fix them  which  when I read about that  I didn t really understand  until I saw it in action myself  First time I went to use my Play PS3 activity  the PS3 did not power up  The remote asked if everything came on  I told it no  it asked what device didn t  I selected PS3  and it popped up a little tutorial on how to pair the Harmony Hub with the PS3  Took maybe two minutes to pair the two and then worked perfectly  Very helpful and simple Navigating the screens is easy  and there are only a handful of them  Dedicated home  favorites  and settings keys around the screen get you back to where you want to be immediately  Spend ten minutes using it and I promise you ll have it down pat  For every Activity or mode if you will  the controls on screen and the physical buttons assume the roles of the equipment you are currently using  For example  my Watch TV activity means I m controlling my DirecTV receiver and the volume through my Sony amp  Therefore  the actions available on the screen and the physical buttons assume those roles   By the way  I find the hardware keys absolutely perfect for controlling the DirecTV receiver   Likewise  I can choose my Watch SmartTV activity  and it will bring up the apps on my TV and let me select whatever app I want with the physical keys  while the touchscreen displays my SmartTV control selections  Same with PS3  Wii  Xbox  etc  As you cycle through your modes  the remote seamlessly offers you the appropriate control options  Pretty cool indeed Fifth  I m not sure why battery life is such a concern  It comes with a charging cradle  seems like a no brainer to me that when you re not using the remote  just pop it in the cradle  no Assuming most of us have to work and kids  if you have them  are in school  there has to be at least some portion of your day where you can let the remote charge up  right When you re sleeping maybe Just doesn t seem like this should be much of a concern  Longer term  I hope the non removable battery lasts a good long while  but I m not too worried about it Finally  I ve been more than pleasantly surprised by how well this works  Granted  I m a smart remote neophyte  and as with any review take this review with a grain or two of salt  but I really and truly found this to be an exceptional product plus a fun grown up toy to boot  Unless you have equipment that really cannot be controlled by the Harmony products  I can t think of any major reason why I wouldn t recommend this  It s not inexpensive per se  especially if you need the Hub as well  but for as well as it works and the capability it offers  I think it s a good value 
It was very easy to hook up  took my brother and I about 40 minutes 
I have synced this with my Echo Dot to provide a richer sound  both for the standard voice as well as music playing   These speakers work very well in that service 
Once again  Logitech knocks it out of the park with this Universal remote Easily programmed  took me 20 minutes at the most   and very easy to use  even by luddites  Both my in laws live with me  and they are technologically retarded  and yet  they are capable of using this remote with minimal issues 
An amazing remote  having just one remote that does it all and not five remotes getting lost one at a time is great 
its pretty good if you aren t looking for too much boom in your trunk 
So I was recommended to buy these headphones by a co worker after mentioning that I was using a set of Astro A50 s on my computer to listen to music  Granted I knew the A50 s were more of a gaming oriented headset rather than a music based one but I didn t really think something could get much better at the time  I m so glad I was so wrong The sound quality  the design  the comfort  the sound isolation effect  Everything exceeded my expectations  In my opinion these are worth every penny I spent on them and then some 
I bought this for my Surface Pro 4  even though it has windows hello  for extra login options  I love this type cover because it feels great in the hand when carrying it around  the keys feel like a real laptop  Highly recommend this for BOTH SP4   SP3 users 
The picture is crystal clear and the inter active web hub is smooth    
This is the best speaker I have ever owned  The sound is so clear and the highs and lows are amazing  I was lenient on buying a Sony product after so many bad Sony products in mid 2000  but I m glad I took a chance  I will now be buying more Sony audio products as well as a new TV as I m replacing my home theater 
Got this one to replace a JBLbluetooth speaker  Don t expect wonders but is pretty goo and you can combine it with several more of the same to build up the experience   if you have the     BTW   I only have 1 haha
Sa sung hS the best tv  Easy to setup and the tv speakers are the best I have ever herd on a tv 
This does not fit into the category of  you get what you pay for   The sound is unreal  Crisp clear  bold  Amazing  the sound quality is that of a way more expensive system  For a 3 piece system  that is well constructed   heavy  for it s size  And the clarity  you will not be disappointed  Main reason for purchase  soundbar and tv voice clarity that we have SUCKS  This an actual deal    I m buying another for another room 
This stereo completely transformed my audio experience  I would definitely recommend 
I have an extremely high end motherboard with built in AC WiFi in a custom built  Typically going from N to AC is enough for most people  But using this Nighthawk A7000  AC1900 boosted my download speeds more than 5x  Cannot suggest this enough for anyone 
Amazing works better than I expected  I was looking for something that would be simple when I needed simple and would work for all my devices 
Amazing picture quality  awesome smart technology for an amazing price 
This is exactly what I was looking for  Looks great  Works amazingly well  And its pretty    
The setup was very easy  I love the sound from this stereo  and I can listen to music that I have downloaded on my smartphone through the Bluetooth wireless connection  I would definitely recommend to a friend  I haven t stopped listening to this stereo since I received it 
Great outdoor speakers and sound  Compliments from the entire neighborhood I entertain each weekend at the river house 
I love this speaker sooo much  The whole light thing makes the whole speaker interesting and the sound and volume it has is perfect 
Me and my husband were comparing this speaker and the UE boom   megaboom  We ultimately went with this speaker and I m so glad we did  It sounds amazing  You have he option of lights on or off  in the app you can change your sound settings  more bass treble  etc  the battery life on this speaker is also just a amazing  All in all  I m so glad we got this speaker 
Went in to buy my wife a Bluetooth speaker for her birthday  she had her mind made up on the Bose until we were shown this speaker  hands down the best sound at low and high volume and it holds a super long charge 
Sounds absolutely great  To be so small and deliver great bass too  To boot  you get lights and a phone charger built in  Six hours of continuous playback is great too  But if needed  can be played while charging 
Mines was delivered this morning April 14th  Just opened it up and I m impressed    Sound is Amazing  Great for Movies Video Games   Music    I actually felt like I was in a theater   Seriously  its That Amazing  You wont regret it  HeY  you may want to buy another one  just for the heck of it   
I have an F150 and these sound great in my truck  
Really cool led lighting effects  The sound and simplicity make it the perfect gym stereo
The sound from this small speaker is unbelievable  Clarity is fantastic and it gets incredibly loud without distortion  Alexa built in is a great benefit as well  Battery life is great and it is waterproof 
This small speaker has amazing sound for the size 
I love definitive technology speakers  I have def tech towers and surrounds also  Amazing product 
This speaker can put out strong volume  bass  and overall sound quality  Long battery life span and it charges quite well  compared to certain speakers and even phones  If you want to listen to music differently and hear certain sounds only heard while wearing high quality headphones  this is a must buy for you 
James Dubenion recommended this speaker  promising that the sound from it will blow our minds  He was right  These speakers put out an amazing sound that I am so thrilled about 
I travel a great deal on airplanes and had been given a pair of Beats Studios by my employer as a gift a couple years back  The ear cups on the beats and the battery were failing so I decided to look into a new set of headphones for the plane  I never was a huge fan of how the Beats sounded  but the noise cancellation was decent and  on long flights  I prefer headphones over my custom earphones  Now  having the JBLs  I realize that the Noise Cancellation was very poor on the beats  and as I said before  they really didn t sound that good I really love my new JBL headphones  the sound quality rivals my favorite cabled headphones  my Shure 440s  840s depending if I want the hyped bottom end   and the fact that they are wireless makes them so much less cumbersome on flights   they will function as cabled phones also if the battery dies  just no noise cancellation  The Beats would not function if the battery died  If you are looking for a superb set of phones with great even adjustable  noise cancellation  I highly recommend the JBL Everest Elite 700 series  Amazing buy 
amazing sound but really difficult to pair with other sony speakers  great stand alone speaker 
Expensive but worth the money if you like great sound and ample bass  Considered this and the JBL Everest Elite 
I bought this for my pontoon boat with  4  6 5 kicker speakers  Amazing sound  loud  and perfect  Bluetooth sounds perfect which I use most  Has lots of options  Great buy
If you want to tune out the world and get lost in your music then these are the headphones for you 
Love it  Amazinng crisp clear sound and great base 
My outdoor speakers sound better than my living room  These things rock 
Perfect for a small space  It was exactly what I was looking for in a very small house 
The salesman at Best Buy recommended these outdoor speakers to replace another pair I had  They are the best sounding outdoor speakers I ever heard and have ever had  These were a great purchase and they really enhance my backyard 
Wanted a great Bluetooth speaker at a low price and that s what I got
Really very good remote  thanks to Logitech team  It is reduced lot of work single remote can operate entire media  I have 7 Devices all are working good 
Best all around remote to control my entire system
Received as a Christmas gift  Replaced my Harmony 700 remote  This one is much easier to use  The touch screen is simple to use and set to your own preference 
I don t get excited about products very often  but the Ultimate Ears Megablast speaker is a truly amazing product First and foremost  it s a speaker  And as such I m amazed at the sound quality that comes from it  When they say 360 degree sound  they mean it  It literally fills the room with sound  Not just sound  but a rich  full sound with plenty of bass  I am very impressed with both the quality and the volume this thing puts out Amazon Alexa has been a new  pleasant experience for me  She responds to just about anything you ask her  There is a little bit of a lag  so don t be in a hurry  So far I ve enjoyed having Alexa play my favorite music just by asking  And if I need a little extra volume  I just have to ask  I m hoping I can figure out how to have her control my internet connected garage door opener And  of course  you can connect to the Megablast using Bluetooth  up to 8 different devices from computers to cell phones  There are just 4 buttons  volume up and down  power  and Bluetooth  Simple  Combining these buttons provides additional functionality I also like the fact that it s wireless  up to 16 hours  I recommend the charging dock  as well  which makes it super easy to charge just by setting it on the dock If you want a speaker that delivers amazing sound quality with lots of volume wherever you are  the Megablast is going to be hard to beat  Alexa is icing on the cake 
I have been using Slingboxes for years  It is a convenient way to watch my satellite TV stations from anywhere from any device  I also can check in and see what the kids are watching from another room 
The only complaint I have about this mouse is that I forget to turn it  off  after I shut down my computer while using it wireless  It has amazing feel and response time  Would definitely buy again  especially at  50 
Really sounds great when you blend the treble with the bass  The sub packs a lot of power the highs are crisp and clean  Overall a very great surround sound system for the money  Thank you BOYTONE and EBAY 
The picture quality is amazing  I feel like I can reach out and touch the characters 
Headphones great for commuting and noise cancelling
Husband bought this 4 my bday and I am n love  Tricky 2 figure out  Still trying 2 wrap my head around the settings  The volume is incredible   Writing this review under his user account to let everyone know it s awesome  
The keyboard I had before wasn t the greatest until I got this one
Thought I was getting wireless  but still very happy with this purchase  While I get caught up in the cord  I must admit that the overall performance of the headphones more than make up for the slight inconvenience of the wire  Very pleased with my purchase 
I bought this headphones on sale for under  200 with moderate expectation of quality and they blew it away  In my opinion these sound better than my Bose Quiet Comfort over the ear headphones and were half the price 
Great sound and love the long lasting battery  App works great with phone and headphones 
The price of these headphones was a little high  but in the end they were worth it and compared to other headphone at this price I prefer these and the case is just a little bonus added
They are so comfortable and fit perfectly around the ears  The sound is great on Bluetooth and wired 
I sport a Def Tech 7 2 mythos  supercube complete setup and it s GREAT  so when I wanted outdoor speakers I naturally went for Def Tech s fist  Two of them easily mounted to the brick under my eave  and provide plenty of quality sound to fill my deck and small backyard when grilling out or working in the back  I don t have a sub to use with them yet  but I ll have my eye out for one as they could use a little help providing more low end  At  199 each right now  buy them up  
Great price for an amazing speaker  I am thinking of purchasing a second one 
Would have liked to called hardwire but due to my room position  wireless was my only option  Didnt want to spend that much money but after taking to a couple friends the nighthawk seemed to be the only option worth the money 
Feels great  works great    just all around amazing 
Highly recommend this speaker  The bass and clarity this speaker gives in such a small product is outstanding  After testing it out against the Bose and The Pill by Dre  this hands down had better quality  I am 250% happy with my purchase  
Recently purchased the Flipside 300 and took it on my trip to Cancun    I don t know why I did not get it long time ago  Fits all my gear perfectly  my iPad  small camera  iPhone  extra cables  I m 6 3 and fits perfect on my back  Number one reason I bought it is the safety as it opens from the back side    
I love this product  The setup literallt takes less than two minutes  Anyone can do it 
I got tired of fighting 5 different remotes to watch programs we liked  I bought this Harmony remote and life is so much easier  It replaced every remote in my entertainment center  Setup was fast and easy too  Every command from the original remotes is available and works on the Harmony remote  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to simplify their entertainment  multimedia center 
Works great  easy to set up and replaces all of my other remotes 
Best gaming mouse I ve owned  I left behind a logitech g602 and g502 for this baby  Great battery life

Man best addition to my sound bar    Would recommend   
Perfect Headphones with right price Works great   
Such good bass and sound quality for such a small speaker and it s totally worth the price 
Super happy with my new product  it is an excellent speaker and would buy another one  
The setup is what blew me away  You charge it  turn it on  plug it into computer  select your devices save settings and done  It took 30 min to sync and create an entire list of devices and quick key settings to do specific tasks Its great 
The sound is incredible and the best part is amazon alexa 
These headphones have great comfort  amazing sound quality  superb battery life  and are quite customizable with the app  These are great headphones and I highly recommend getting them 
These headphones Rock  When I m using them I can t hear a single thing around me  which is nice cause I don t lose my husband and my kid 
This is a lot of tv for such a small price    It s not 4K but with Directv it s still incredibly
This item is awesome  Loud  clear sound and easy to use 
This mouse is hands down the best wireless one that I have ever used 
To be honest you guys always sell the best product and I can t say anything about what you guys sale I m amazed

A l p I n e h a s a l w a y s p e r f o r m e d g r e a t 
Alpine is a go to brand for my audio needs  quality sound 
Quality speakers for our vehicle Excellent sound  
Best speakers i have bought  They are just what i expected 
Great sounding speakers that wont break the bank  
I am no audiophile but these speakers are incredible for the price  If you are into the idea that high dollar speakers are better because they cost more then this review is not for you  I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Montereo Sport  without the Infinity system installed  and the passenger side stock speaker was blown  I decided to shop around for not only for middle priced speakers but also a brand name that was reputatble Not only did I get more than I bargained for  I liked them so much  I swapped out the entire SUV I replaced the front speakers first and did a test run   I listen to Metal music  and the sound was clean and crisp on the highs and the lows were not bad either  Don t get me wrong  you are not going to hear the lowest of the lows with these speakers but the sound quailty of the bass was more than adequate I could definitely tell the difference between the new SPE 6000 s and the stock in the back  For the price and quality  I decided I wanted to change out the rest of the vehicle  Let s say I am very pleased with these speakers and I do recommend them  My car does not have all the amps  crossovers and bells and whistles but for a good price in my opinion  these speakers were way better than expected  SuperDave71Memphis  TN
These speakers sound fine but I did not know they needed to be cut down to size to fit in my Toyota RAV 4  This was an extra expense I was not counting on  The write up stated it would fit my car when it actually did not unless it was fitted  If you did not cut down the speakers  you would not be able to roll your windows down all the way  Other than theat they sound great expecially for the money  It is a huge upgrade from the factory installed speakers Fred
I bought these to replace a pair of stock speakers on my 1995 Ford Escort that had gotten warped and dry rotted and sounded as bad as bad can be  I am no audio expert but these along with a set of Alpine SPS 517 speakers sound amazing  They have good clean  crisp sound Install was easy enough  They are a great buy if you want something that sounds good but is not expensive 
These speakers sound excellent  Best quality for your buck  Have them hooked up to a pioneer deh p7400hd and they sound awesome 
I recommend Alpine products due to their consistent quality  They fit the car door speaker openings  Great mid range and richness  I need an amp to bring out their best 
Upgraded speakers in 99 pickup  Have used Alpine decks and speakers for many years  Never dissatisfied  Great product  great price during holidays
When the Best Buy store I visited didn t have what I wanted in stock  I decided to take a chance on these Alpine speakers  They were a few dollars more  but I m glad I made this purchase  Easy to install and they sound really good  Crisp highs  mid range and decent lows  I do not have an amp  just a stock stereo  to really drive these  but I m sure if you did it would improve the sound quality  Overall I would rate these a 4 5 and would recommend them to anyone who would like to upgrade their stock or modified system 
Very good speakers Great value could not pass up  
I got this through the vine program We already have the Ultimate   hub for our living room  So I got this for our bedroom setup Set up  Amazingly easy and the Logitech database of electronics they can support is extensive and even had my old Westinghouse monitor  Updating the firmware is painless too Use  This is where Logitech comes up a little short thus the 4 stars  The touch screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough  Sometimes when I swipe or click a button it works and other times it doesn t  I really don t know what I am doing wrong  But the touch screen and the several pages  swipe left  right  really makes things convenient Also provides the 30 second fast forward for my Comcast DVR and 15 second jump back An incredibly impressive piece of hardware  Battery life is great  And firmware updates come fast and regularly 
After using this product for almost a month I consider it a great product  almost perfect Great sound and features I would only wish for four more features and solving one problem to call it perfect Features 1  AM reception2  Wi fi internet reception3  Normalize sound volume with EBU R 128 method and use volume control to set normalization levels from all sources leaving the volume as set after unit is turned back on 4  Control by z wave home automation systems However  lack of these features does not detract from its value for the price for which it is sold  Its a great value Problem  Unit often does not respond to either remote or on set buttons on first press but usually requires pressing several times to get a response  This can be aggravating Other than this problem  I would easily give it five stars 
I installed this for use with a Sony KDL40HX800  a model about 3 years old and weighing less than 40 pounds  This mount is what is found when using the Sanus website Mountfinder for this model  Most of the one star detraction is my fault  but I ll let Sanus share the star because this mount doesn t really have the rotation that I needed  I didn t specifically look at the rotation spec  my fault  but it s only 30 degrees  Even using a TV that s at the very low end of the size spec  this is a pretty low value  and it would be nice to find different models of mounts that feature different specs for different needs  This one is touted to be super slim  and indeed it is  which I needed due to placement in a walkway to a door  Going for this feature sacrificed rotation evidently  The feature of moving laterally is nice  but of dubious value except in very specific circumstances The other specs of 10 degree tilt  seems to be about actual performance  but the extension from wall value is spec ed at 10  but was actually 14  The tilt mechanism was the only poor performer  Even with the tension completely released  the sider binds at about 75 tilt  Adding a light coat of lithium grease didn t help  It will achieve full tilt with a firmer jiggle  but it really should be smooth as silk One outstanding feature is a heavy paper  vinyl coated  template for marking the wall  Many time companies provide newspaper weight templates  which are not stiff enough to get a reliable mark  This template is also dead on for hole location All the other aspects of the mount are excellent  I have no doubt it would hold full value of weight specified  and is constructed with no corners cut on quality  The instructions are good  and the installation process is well documented with illustrations and correct  The only thing that could be better for installation is the screw selection provided  Two different lengths of M4  M6 and M8 screws are provided for attaching the rails to the TV  depending on how the back of your TV is constructed  For my TV  the M6 14mm was way to short with a short spacer  and not quite long enough with the 40mm and a long spacer  For my TV  something in between 14 and 40 would allow more threads engaged in the TV So bottom line is that it s almost perfect for what the specs are  but it would be nice if Sanus would provide all mounts that would fit rather than just one Kudos to Amazon as well  The price dropped from 249 to 199 two days after my order  One call of 2 minutes resulted in the credit of 50 
Would have given it 5 stars if I could figure out how to adjust the mouse pad sensitivity  It may take an update from Microsoft  hopefully it ll come soon  I have gotten used to it so its not that big of a deal anymore
Everything is working as advertised  the the gripes i have is when i first setting it up it was difficult to figure out the exact format my tv and projector  like getting 16 9 and 1080p it was trial and error figuring out if it was my cablebox or sling box itself everything was trial and error and you have to do alot of research and forums  Slingbox website was little help  the second gripe I have is the ability to watch 2 tvs at the same time kinda defeats the purpose of having this gadget  But it works when your all away and you have internet access
I had a few issues with Arc but  support was really fast and they set it up for me  This is the best remote I have ever owned  The only thing I don t like is the bottom is made for your hand only  not laying on a flat surface  Some how  they need to design it for both in your hand and not falling on the floor or in the couch  It should lay flat  Other than that  I highly recommend this  Does work great with ARC 
I have used Logitech remotes for a number of years and this one is one of the best  It s smaller size makes for a perfect fit in my hand and activities are performed withou flaws  I did not give it a 5 Star rating as I feel Logitech could do a better job of placement of the buttons 
The only issue  is that it comes without a real user manual  or cable to connect to a 3 5mm headphone jack which is common on many phones and almost all computers  The directions are nonexistent  tech support was clueless  I figured it out  but a frustrating experience  The upside is that it has a really nice rich sound  and a built in digital radio tuner  sd card slot  USB port  and a remotecontrol  Well worth the setup effort  it also looks great 
While this remote does a fine job overall  some of the most commonly used buttons  directional controls  are inconveniently placed and some on  off functions do not work consistently  it still proves to be almost a great product 
Great for introduction to gaming  Design enables you to upgrade video card and possible add a solid state drive easily  You want room to grow and with YouTube assistance  the changes can be done yourself 
I ve owned and used this bag for a year now  It s become my primary bag only when I bring my 70 200mm  Which is also the reason I purchased this back  It s well made  comfortable and fits more everything I need  So why is it only ALMOST fantastic  First  the side pocket size only zips upward  Been a number of occasions where I ve found myself is wet weather  Thus  with the zipper zipping upward only  water has got into the pocket  Secondly  the ONLY way to get to the camera is to take off the bag and opening the entire backpack  It sure would be nice to have a zipper on the top of the bag so you could quickly access your camera  Don t know if there is a perfect bag  If there is  I haven t found it  For now  this will do 
Let s be realistic  Most of us use our tablets as lightweight notebooks and an on screen keyboard just isn t practical  The Type Pro cover works well  attaches and removes easily  and I love the integrated fingerprint reader for login 
If you have a Nest thermostat don t buy this unit  But if you don t it is really amazing what this remote can do  Easy set up and user intuitive controls  Lightweight but very responsive to movement and touch 
works well to watch my dvr at my camp  only issue is control  has at least 5 second delay
I use this paired with E ForCity Bluetooth audio transmitter  I can use both on my PC and living room TV by just moving small transmitter to which device I want to listen to  Light weight and comfortable for entire movie 
The remote was a breeze to set up  It allowed me to put my components in a closed cabinet  Awesome

Go get you some Best Buy      They have Great service   Super knowledgeable people  The prices are right on   
No more multi remotes and trying to juggle them to get one event organize all your devices or components programmed into this remarkable remote 
Great with separately purchased hubOne of the only remotes that has IR built in along with RFPutting stuff in a cabinet is great but unless you run an RF to the tv   you can t control TVMy only major complaint   impossible to control all smart tv controls especially since newer tv remotes use a trackpad or just gesturesThat needs to be included in new Harmony remotes moving forward
This harmony remote is a great product  I bought it to replace my cable box remote that stopped working properly 
If you a person like me that has ton of remotes you should get one of these because its an all in one solution  It also work with apple tv which those remotes get lost fast  Battery life is good 
All in all for the price these are some nice speakers  They aren t heavy on the bass department but vocals mids and highs sound great
all the we have had put in to our house have been king and pleasant to talk to and will do more business with you and have recommended to our friends
Superb  All of my devices are now controlled with my new Harmony  Had the older model andecided to upgrade to this advanced model when I purchased my new TV  High Tech can store all of my favorites and bring up on the new touch pad  To many features to mention  Very pleased 
If you only have one camera and a few lenses this is a great little bag  Or if you don t want to lug your big camera bags around  this is perfect for taking some of your equipment  It is designed like a backpack so you can carry it on your back if you have to hoof it any distance  but it also has a handle on top if you are just going from your car to a building  The zipper is concealed on the side against your back  so you don t have to worry about someone pilfering your gear while you are walking on a crowded street or in the subway  All the compartments are custom shaped however you want with the Velcro dividers  Plenty of compartments for spare batteries  filters and memory cards  It even has straps to hold down your tripod while you are hiking to your favorite nature spot  Well padded to protect your equipment from normal drop heights while taking out of your vehicle  Priced reasonably for all the benefits it offers  Love mine 
Great mobile speaker with good sound quality  Enjoyed using at beach this weekend 
I own a Google Home and I have played around with an Amazon Echo at my local Best Buy  Both are really good personal assistant devices but I was frankly underwhelmed by each device�s audio quality particularly when it comes to music playback  As a result I was excited to get the Ultimate Ears Megablast with the expectation of exceptional sound quality  The Megablast come nicely packaged and includes a power adapter  a usb cable  and some basic instructions  You need the Ultimate Ears app from either the Apple app store or the Google Play store to complete setup  Within the app one simply connects the Megablast to your WiFi network  pair Bluetooth devices  and sign into your Amazon account and you�re up and running  Can�t beat that for simplicity  I started off by asking Alexa some standard personal assistant questions like the time and weather then quickly moved on to music  I have an Amazon Music Unlimited account so I start requesting songs  I pump up the volume using the   control on the side of the device and I�m quickly blown away by the sound quality emanating from the Megablast  I put it through it paces by requesting various music selections from rock  to jazz  to classical  What a treat  Great music reproduced with great quality by simply asking Alexa  Deep bass and clean rich highs filled my house  Even on the max volume there was no distortion  This thing rocks  One disappointment I discovered which you should be aware of if you use Amazon Music Unlimited  Amazon offers a reduced pricing option called Amazon Echo monthly which limits your account to just one Echo device  It appears that this plan is only available on Echo devices and not on licensed devices such as the Megablast  I hope this changes in the future since Amazon support was even surprised that it didn�t work  I should point out another discovery that the Megablast powers off when not in use  I thought initially that this was a disappointing limitation for a personal assistant device until I found the setting in the app to change this auto sleep feature in time increments of 15 minutes  30 minutes  1 Hour  3 hours  or never  You will get 16 hours of constant use on the never sleep setting  Impressive  Buyers should note that Ultimate Ears also sells a great charging dock accessory for the Megablast called the Ultimate Ears Power Up  This let�s you leave it on at all time while also maintaining a full charge for when you want to take the Megablast with you  When you do the unit is big but is still quite portable  I was happy to learn that the Megablast is also water resistant  Not only that but you could immerse in water up to 3 feet deep for 30 minutes  Why you would want to submerge such an expensive device is beyond me but hey you can if you want  As I used the device for several days one issue stood out  While the Magablast boasts a multiple microphone design with beam forming technology I found myself constantly repeating myself to get Alexa to respond  Very frustrating  I�m hoping that this is improved with a firmware update  Other than this one issue I was truly impressed by the Ultimate Ears Megablast  I would definitely recommend particularly for music lovers seeking excellent sound quality 
The best part about this speaker is Alexa and the connectivity of smart devices  The sound is crisp and clear even at max level but the bass is minimal at best  At very low volumes the bass actually sounds pretty decent  The audio resonates very well from this speaker and it s difficult to pinpoint exactly where the sound is coming from which is great  Projects well and is very clear  When playing audio with Alexa everything functions beautifully  but connect to bluetooth and you will wish for a headphone jack on your phone  Range is great but connecting and staying connected is a pain  I am hoping a firmware update will fix this since I think this has plenty of potential  The life proofing is great and makes this an ideal outdoor speaker 
If this were a  NEW  device I would perhaps write a lengthy review but instead it is the fusion  upgrade of a product that has been around for a few years  My best friend received the original Echo back when it first launched and it was pretty sweet though something I didn t really feel the need to own especially since I didn t think it was THAT great of a speaker  I have several Bluetooth speakers but I am always looking for the next and best  With the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST I feel like I have found that speaker The UE MEGABLAST  you just have to put that in all caps   is an outstanding Bluetooth speaker  It is by far  the clearest and probably loudest speaker I have every owned  minus my old component system back in the day   Add to that the Alexa functionality and it makes this a no brainer  I do a lot of cooking and my wife likes to bake so to now have a speaker that we can command with our voices and can fill the entire lower floor of our house with great music  is a wonderful thing  I probably won t be using all of the features of Alexa but I have already enjoyed checking the local traffic and weather in the mornings before heading out to work I m betting I will also never have the opportunity to fully test out the waterproofing since I plan to keep this inside most of the time and I don t have a pool  but since it is in the kitchen I at least don t have to worry about it getting splashed Set up was a breeze  I didn t even do it the right way and was still up and running in less than 5 minutes  I plugged in the MEGABOOM and paired it with my iPhone and the phone prompted me to download the Ultimate Ears app  once that was downloaded it did a quick 30 sec firmware update and I was ready to sign into my Amazon account  20 seconds later I had the speaker jamming out some Def Leppard and I was good I HIGHLY recommend the Power Up base accessory since it makes it a lot easier to keep this thing charged since you just have to leave or drop it on the dock  The white base is nice and I actually didn t even have to use the  brick  that the MEGABLAST came with  I just have the USB cord going into a power port built into my plug outlet  No muss and no fuss  When I want to take it outside or to the beach I can just grab it and go and know that it is charged up  UE says that you can get 16 hours on a charge and I have yet to test that out but it has gone strong for over 7 so far If you have been thinking about getting an Alexa capable device and have been holding off  don t  Ultimate Ears has created a top notch Bluetooth speaker that deserves to be bought just for that but then ices the cake by adding Amazon Alexa functionality 
I ve had each of the new covers for the surface pro  This material is by far superior in so many ways  No smudging or getting dirty  Feels great and looks luxurious  Great investment 
The stereo looks and sounds amazing  it was just a long  aggravating process to purchase  It was not in stock in local store  so drove all the way to Framingham to pick up  Box was damaged  but was assured no problems  Got it home  opened the box  and the receiver was all smashed  Had to bring it all the way back to Framingham to exchange  Was a 2 day process and 8 total hours of driving  nevermind the gas 
Not really happy  Did have the original Harmony One which I liked  The swipe function does not work for me  Think I do something right and it turns out wrong  Spend more time struggling with the correct commands than getting my devices going  Will be looking for a replacement that can handle smart tv as well  A disappointing purchase for me  Any ideas Thanks 
This is an initial review based on just having received my Harmony One and getting it set up  I will update it if my observations or opinions change  I acquired this through my company s award s program  otherwise I would have purchased it through Amazon  That said  it IS an expensive remote  but     I think it is worth the price This is my second Harmony  my first being the Harmony 700  I have been very happy with the 700  but it was getting a little long in the tooth  and I think some problems were developing  So  despite some of the negatives in reviews here  I decided to give the Ultimate One a try First  I would like to address the ergonomics issue  specifically with regard to position of the controls for DVD  DVR  BluRay playback  I agree that for some this is a significant negative  but I think that ignores one major factor  the Harmony Ultimate One is primarily a TOUCH SCREEN DEVICE  These controls are available on the touch screen  To access the movement controls  you simply touch an up arrow button at the bottom of the screen  There  I ve saved a bunch of people some heartache     you re welcome Further to the touch screen  there are multiple screen pages available  As with smart phones and other touch screen mobile devices  you simply swipe through the screens  Even with the default settings  you can control most  if not all device and activity functions  Naturally  after a limited time using the remote  I will probably discover some things I want to tweak or add  But that s true with any new device One feature that was not available on my 700  which I plan to wipe and reprogram for a setup in a different room  is the ability to download favourite channels based on your location  zip code or postal code  and provider  Whoa  that is cool    it saves a lot of time The next new feature not available on my 700 is that this is primarily a WiFi based remote  I wasn t sure how this would work  and whether the hub  blaster architecture would work properly for my physical entertainment centre  However  connecting to my WiFi network was flawless and the signalling to devices has worked perfectly as far as I can tell at this point And in regard to signalling  the Ultimate One is MUCH faster than my 700  Maybe when I reprogram the 700 I can speed it up  but at this point I think the Ultimate is just plain better The setup of the Ultimate One was quick and painless  The web based installation gave me the option of transferring the settings from the 700 to the Ultimate  and it worked perfectly  Even without this advantage  first time owners of a Harmony remote will find program so much easier than most other universal remotes After getting the Ultimate set up  I downloaded the Harmony Control app for my iPond Touch  and my wife will download the app for her iPhone and iPad  My brief experience with the app is that it is cleanly designed and performs well So my summary for initial impressions is that this is a great remote  I frankly think that a lot of negative points in reviews are overblown  I am not judging the reviewers  but think that the overall perspective of having a solidly designed  well manufactured remote that offers the performance that it does  well  my opinion is many if not of the most of the niggles are minor  Just my opinion 
This Smart TV works great    Very affordable  great company  nice look  Easy to set up and it works like a gem 
I m a longtime Harmony user but this is the second touchscreen remote I ve used  I previously had the Harmony Touch  which is very similar   Lots of people complain about the placement of the transport buttons above the touchscreen   and I definitely feel their pain  it s a much poorer layout than the Harmony One  that prince of remotes  all hail    If you re a TiVo user  it s a real pain in the keyster  but I think I ve worked out some customizations that make it pretty usable First  I reprogrammed the Direction Right and Direction Right buttons on the center wheel to correspond to TiVo Advance and TiVo Replay  respectively  I left the Long Press function on the buttons alone  so I can long press right or left to use the Guide  It s a compromise  but I really need the Replay and Advance features under my thumb where they belong  so this works well for me Next  I reprogrammed the Exit button to Zoom on short press  This is a much more convenient way to expand to full screen if you re looking at the DVR guide or list  The long press will invoke TiVo Clear by default  allowing you to delete shows in your list If you re a TiVo Bolt user  which I am   I reprogrammed the Yellow button on the right to do a sequence of Play and Select  this toggles Quick Play on and off   Quick Play is great for watching sports and longer shows at 30 faster speed with adjusted audio  It can sound a bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks  but it works well  especially for football where audio really isn t important anyway  Also for Bolt users  I reprogrammed the Green button on the far right to correspond to the D button on the new remote   this invokes Commercial Skip  As not all shows support Commercial Skip  I set up a sequence of four Advance  30 sec skip  presses for the long press on the green button   that way I can get kinda sorta commercial skip functionality even when it s not there  also works for non Bolt users  Using these mods  I almost never use the transport buttons on the top  which results in far less dropped remotes  inadvertent touchscreen presses  and cursing  thrown remotes  Hope this helps   
This box works ok but any positive experience to be had with this item are ruined by having to watch ads  IMHO paying a premium for the hardware and having to watch ads is inexcusable 
It was easy to install and setup this device  I compared it to internal wireless adpaters in four computers  and this device outperformed all of them 
As a replacement for an iPhone 5s as a hotspot  don t know if it s worth the extra phone line  and download speeds are barely acceptable  Not really worth the extra costs 
Forget about the other famous overpriced piece of plastic headphones by Beats    The JBL Everest Elite 700 Wireless Over the Ear Headphones steal the show with its crisp clear sound and incredible noise canceling feature that is easily adjusted and tweaked form the app on your phone 
I purchased these about a week ago to have for a zone 2 on my yamaha rx a720  I have not gone through the recommended break in procedure or time  but I must admit these speakers sound incredible  Sound quality is crisp on the highs and perfect on the lows  I would reccomend these to anyone wanting outdoor speaker  I would even consider them for indoor use  they almost sound better than my indoor setup 
It straight up didn t work  Would not recommend  It had decent bass but that was only when the speakers work  Go ahead and spend  20 more to get something much nicer and reliable 
Great picture  Intuitive setup  Smart Hub works with only minimal issues  Only problem I ve had is fumble fingering the virtual keyboard 
Absolutely fantastic remote  easy to setup  tons of features  And if you have an existing Harmony remote you can just transfer your settings right over the new one with no fuss 
Never would I have imagined spending this much on a remote  but after having it for a few months  I can t imagine having anything but a high version of Harmony
The price is up there  However the quality is well worth it  They are durable  the sound is frickin amazing      I love to hear the highs and lows as well as every instrument being played as well as the vocals I m so glad I purchased these  Now I can hear music sounds the way it s intended to be heard     
I Love the Slingbox   I m able to view my favorite Football team play for free when visiting out of state for free
Great speaker for the money
4 cores and 16gb ram  a godsend for someone who has been using dual core laptops with 4gb ram
I finally upgraded my Original Logitech One Remote that has operated my home theater for many years  This new remote is smaller and as feature rich as the original  but I believe laid out a bit better 
I ve been a pro musician for 37 years and have owned a lot of headphones in that time  I ve listened to headphones in the  2K range and higher  I ve heard master recordings of known songs in studios  Everyone is different  but let s just say I have some experience with listening and I really can t stand much below excellent quality when listening to music These headphones are an incredible value for what you get  Not only is the craftsmanship about as good as can be  but there is a detail to the design  fit  and finish that you don t come across every day  You can tell as soon as you test drive a pair that they are exceptional  Crystal clear highs down to thunderous lows and all the mids in between  this handles them with ease  The P7 s do not exaggerate anything across the frequency spectrum from my analysis  so you re hearing exactly what the artist intended  The better your input source  the better the sound  but these can be driven from a second generation iPod and have plenty of volume for those who like their music REAL loud  No headphone amp needed  Period  This is the first pair of headphones that I am doing a burn in with  I did listen to about 5 songs before anything  though  and they were phenomenal in their reproduction  Believe me when I say if you ve never heard your music through very high end speakers or headphones  these will open up an entire new world of sound for your listening  You ll hear things in the mix you never knew were there  Yes  THAT caliber of headphones  and not for  2K 
Easy to program all done on computer  Has a glitch once in a while 
I like this product very much  Many people complained about the ads but they have not effected me because I have the app on my phone then send it to my roku to view on my TV  By doing this I do not get banner ads and I can view my services at my parents house 
The sales man was very informative and helpful  The Jetpack goes with me on all my trips
My wife and I were looking for a tv to put in her office  We didn t want a large tv that might overpower the area  The 40 inch Samsung did the job  We didn t think that the size warranted being 4K  We are satisfied with our purchase and would certainly recommend it 
You have to be devoted to Logitech     It is a great remote if you are fluent in the web and the web app  Easy to upgrade  if the device is in the system  not so easy to upgrade if you are a Pioneer     Over the years  they have gotten much better with respect to custom programming    
I ve had several universal remotes and there s always one or a few things that don t work on each or some of your components With this remote  everything works and is responsive  The interface is a little confusing at first but once you understand it  it s great 
I made multiple trips and stayed in the store each time for over an hour listening to every portable speaker  ALL others were too heavy and overpowering in one aspect or another with an obvious need for balance  Balanced in the delivery of all that comes through it is the best way I can describe this speaker  With others I wanted to stop listening  but with this Sony h ear go I did and still do want to turn it on and up 
Needed a better version of the Slingbox from the Pro and Solo  Works well  build in wifi is solid and quality is excellent   setup is eh but if your determined you get thru it 
Disclaimer  I bought this at Best Buy instead of ordering it though Amazon   Not that it should matter just saying I m a big fan of minimalist design so I thought I would love this remote  Unfortunately  the ergonomics and button placement are terrible  The guide  volume and pager buttons are in the worst possible place   you have to reposition your hand on the remote in order to press it  These buttons are used the most when watching tv they should be where the LCD is placed  or on the LCD   The lcd itself is centrally located but rarely used and isn t as responsive as a normal lcd screen on an iphone  samsung device  Logitech need to make up their mind   buttons or no buttons My other issue is with the setup  You have to download and install a silverlight application  why silverlight  and register an account with harmony in order to program the remote  Your entire setup data is stored on logitech servers so that anyone looking into your account can see the devices you own and are using with this remote  Why can t I just have a universal remote that doesn t send information about the items in my house to another companyI was having an issue with the backlight making a high pitched noise when it was on  I called the support line and they told me to update the firmware   when it didn t go away the guy told me they have to escalate the issue to some other department  When I got off the phone I got an email saying my issue was resolved  I took the remote back the next day  They don t seem like a very customer oriented company   after 90 days they charge you 10 dollars to make a call to the support line if you are having issues even though they offer a year warranty on the device  I don t get it I will say I liked the xbox integration but it wasn t worth the 200 dollar price point 
An overall good product for the price  especially due to its Bluetooth capability 
Being from a Reggae based inspiration  these headphones are bass heavy  but being a bass player  I actually really like that  The rest of the sound spectrum is quite good  These are simply a great bargain if you don t mind a little extra clean bass  My only complaint is that the power indicator LED is quite dim and hard to see 
Before purchasing this device  I tried a couple of lower end logitech remotes  Neither of those worked quite right  However  with the elite  I was pleasantly surprised  Setup was easy  The integration with the Amazon echo is an outstanding feature  One or two little things are annoying  like switching between activities  Often it does not quite do what it is suppose to do  I end up turning everything off and restarting from the activity I want  or going into each component and making the adjustment required  The screens are not the easiest to navigate through  there is a learning curve  Overall a solid remote and the ability to control other smart devices is a plus 
Small but large in sound  this small speaker  small in my opinion  puts out strong bass for its size  Here is a link to a video with bass test    https     www youtube com  watch?v r0Cw4mfOaro
This has gone too far  A remote without a numerical pad is less than useless  Sent it back and downgraded to the 650  as replacement for my broken Harmony One   Would have preferred a new Harmony One  but the 650 will do 
This remote has save us time and effort if for no other reason than the help key function  We can search channels thru the guide with ease Love it 
Really pleased with this       better and simpler than the previous version I had  The updated version of the one I had was over double the price of this baby  so it was an easy  and good  choice to make 
Hard to find      But I found it  Just like the original and from a name brand that matches my camcorder 
I ve been testing the speaker over the last weeks and I am amazed by the sound that this size speaker is delivering  The battery is clearly a strong value with delivery times clearly over other  more pricy  speakers  The bass adjustments and the lights changing the color with the music add a funny touch for the kids parties I liked the possibility to charge your phone  it has a USB plug on the back  in case you are reproducing music and running out of battery I didn t put the fifth star because I found that the bluetooth connection sometimes is not as fast or automatic as other devices and sometimes I need to access to the app recommended by the manufacturer  from where you can do adjustments to the speaker   that in my opinion is not up to the standards of the speaker itself 
I bought these headphones for my daughter and she loves them  They are light weight  super soft over the ears and the blue tooth feature works great with your mobile devices  The only down fall I experienced was when I sync them to her laptop  The headphones would make strange noises and then cut out  When I unsynced them and plugged them in using the 1  8 jack they work perfectly  She loves them and that s all that matters to me 
Other than a few oddly placed buttons  I couldnt ask for more 
With the addition of a fingerprint reader  better spaced keys  and larger track pad  this is a great improvement over the previous Surface Pro 3 Type Cover 
Much easier to use than my old 659  The simpler buttons and multi page touch screen work great  make intuitive decisions on what to show and are very responsive  It is easy to use one handed because the more acute edges are easier to grip It took me a little while to get the new software working right and had to do a few reboots of the remote and restarts of the software to get everything working and properly synced  Eventually everything was sorted out and it works nicely 
A very nice upgrade to my previous hot spot  Can connect more devices and doesn t appear to loose speed to each device 
We ve been using ours for a few weeks now  I bought it to replace a Harmony  I can t remember the model   which I had bought about 6 7 years ago because it had been dropped too many times  The setup was very easy on my computer  It took us a bit to find out how to get to the number pad but it seems to be working very well  Our system isn t too complicated  The remote feels nice in your hand and I like the simple buttons 
My other laptop charger crapped out a while ago so I had to replace it  Works like a charm 
I ordered this keyboard instead of the new keyboard that was released with the Surface Pro based on cost  The difference between the two seemed to be the material on the keyboard  rather than the function  and since I have been happy with the function of my previous keyboards  money won out  This is a great keyboard key travel is good and the feel is much like my desktop computer 
If you buy a Surface Pro 4  you need this  It makes it much better  since the touchscreen keyboard is not really that good  It s not quite like having a laptop  but at least you have a physical keyboard 
Product is very easy to use  allows on the co connect to the internet  without tying up the speed on your phone
If you have a Microsoft Surface this is an obvious must have  Finger scanner works well but I don t use the feature often 
Keyboard fits perfectly  It attaches magnetically to the Surface and works as a cover for the screen  Very good quality  Keys feel good to the touch  Touchpad is great  Your Surface basically becomes a laptop when the keyboard is attached  This one has the fingerprint reader which works seamlessly with Windows Hello to log you in  Didn t like using the camera to log in because it insists on logging you in continuously and sometimes it logged me in and I wasn t even looking at the camera  The fingerprint reader works much better 
This is a must have for anyone who enjoys watching TV  The power to control your cable box and watch your shows anywhere even half way across the world is awesome  Great HD quality picture and the free Slingbix app makes it that much better 
This is the second Harmony Ultimate One I ve bought for the house  Easy to program and very  very easy to use 
I upgraded from my old Harmony remote  It was still working but I had worn all the paint off the buttons and decided it was a good time to upgrade  I m not disappointed  The touch screen is very responsive  and all the features I love are still there  It makes it so much easier to have one remote  not only for all my devices  but for the activities I enjoy like listening to the radio or playing the XBox  Truly makes life easier 
While Windows 10 has video recognition to login  there are times that just putting your index finger on the reader is quicker and   always works  Spend the little extra and get the fingerprint reader
I have several devices to control in different rooms  All control is in this one unit  The Harmony touch makes it easy to operate every device perfectly  Programing is easy enough and is always backed up 
I really appreciated the ability to transfer the settings from my older Logitec to the new At first I missed the number keys  on the screen not buttons  but find the on screen favorite station icons so much better I cant imagine having multiple devices with multiple remotes changing inputs etc  This is a must item 
I have been a Custom AV Installer for 25 Years  These Remotes saved my Marriage  I don t spend my Weekends at Clients houses helping them turn on their Systems  I actually set one up for every job we do for a  Test Drive   I tell the Client that they don t have to pay for it  unless they love it  I have only taken one back       We do many  many installs 
Best keyboard  A must when using a tablet and always is connected 
For anyone tired of multiple remotes  this is a must  Even works with older generation sound systems Easybset up and like the use of a charger that is also a place to keep track of the remote  No more list remotes 
Received the speaker and read the instructions  Charged the speaker  synced it to my phone and WOW   Pleasantly surprised by the sound and bass of this tiny speaker  The lighting mode and features on the SongPal app is an added bonus  It may be a small feature to other people  but I enjoy the lights synchronize with the beats and melody  The sound of this speaker fills the entire house  I make sure to listen to music more when I m home thanks to this power speaker 
This small speaker has no problem filling the room with its sound  You have the option to  boost  the bass   although it sounds great either way  I stood in the store for 30  minutes testing  listening to all brands of the demo speaker and I just loved the sound of this one best   
Easy set up  Sometimes does not turn on the TV immediately  Hit the help button and that turns on the TV 
I didn t think I would actually extend it out from the wall but I am glad I bought this one  I actually swing the TV out quite often  I feel very secure of my 64  VERY heavy plasma hanging from the wall 
If you have a strong password  the fingerprint reader makes logging on much easier 
I very much appreciate the device  Only issue is that it can start to feel heavy after a while 
The website instructions did not help  a little to complicated for me   
This replaced an internal Wifi card that died in a desktop  It installed easily and the large antenna pulls in a strong signal  Definitely recommend 
Had this in Vegas and charged 4 phone off it for most of the day so it was great not to have to find an charge station or head back to the hotel 
I have a Surface Pro 3 and have loved using it  but the type cover always felt a little less than functional to me  It worked  but I always preferred typing on a full laptop or computer printer if it were anything more than a quick paragraph  Don t even get me started on the tracpad  It was too small and nowhere near sensitive enough  No more  This keyboard feels as good as one on a quality laptop would and it s a joy to type on it  The tracpad isn t even in the same class as the old one  It feels great  it responsive  and is large enough to use comfortably and without moving my hands from the keyboard  I don t see much need to upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 to the 4  but I definitely recommend upgrading the keyboard and pen  The fingerprint scanner is a nice touch and it works great  I ve never had to rescan my finger to log in  coming from someone who cannot get phone fingerprint scanners to work ever   However  it s not really necessary  I was hoping that I could use it with a password manager so I could log in to websites with a fingerprint  but I haven t been able to figure that out yet  Whether to get the cover with the scanner or not is a personal choice  Regardless  I recommend either of the updated type covers 
Very easy to program  Just put in your devices by model number and tell it where everything is connected  e g  DVD is on input 1 on the TV   The software download from the Internet  Worked great on my MacBook Pro 15  late 2013   You need to plug in the remote to program it  they call it sync  once everything is setup and it includes a USB to micro USB cable  so if you have a laptop with the new USB C connector  you will need to use an adaptor or buy a new cable  so new MacBook Pro  late 2016   and MacBook users will need to figure out a cable solution The Ultime One is IR  it doesn t include the RF base  but the base can be bought separately at a later date if you decide you need RF We have Roku 3 and 4 players  which use RF on their included remotes  however the Roku player can receive IR too  but it s not as responsive as it is with RF  You also need to point the remote at the player  which you may not be used to if you use the Roku remote a lot  My daughter complained at first but I removed the battery from the old tv and Roku remotes  so they don t leak over time  and put them away  so she has to use the Logitech  After a few days she adapted to having to point the remote  Hopefully your significant other or kids are as flexible  The touch screen is responsive and easy to use  You can swipe over from the actions screen to the gesture screen and use it to easily raise or lower the volume  swipe up or down on the screen instead of using the volume up down buttons   It works great and so far I m very happy with the purchase 1 star reduction because of the lower IR output requiring aiming more to use it 
Purchased this along with an Alpine car stereo and it sounds great  While Alpine has more expensive speakers  these do just fine  you don t need to spend more unless you add an amp to your stereo and want to go deaf 
Summary  This mount is quality  Its made out of heavy steel and once its mounted you ll have no fear of it falling  Installation is a bit cumbersome and you will want to have 2 people to install it ideally  The one critique I have of this is that it does not allow you to go a full 90 degrees left and right if you need it  Otherwise  its a quality product that will last a lifetime  and somewhat flexible as far as allowing you to mount the tv where your studs arePros  Quality product made of heavy steelVery adjustable  can adjust height  pivot  tilt etcCons Does not allow for full 90 degree rotationtakes two to installa little expensive for what you get
We love the Slingbox M2  which gives us access to our own TV anywhere we go  We use it all the time 
Really a magical experience for music  movies  and games  The sound gives you a spacious soundstage with great separation of instruments and sounds  The bass is rich deep and to me not muddy in the least bit  These aren t beats style bass meaning not muddy over exaggerated geared toward mainly the rap  hip hop genres  These are geared toward everything else  Their build quality is stunningly durable  Comes with 2 wires  One with mic for ios devices  Not sure if the controls for volume and music works for android  Being able to replace the wire if need be and ear pads are too  Ear pads are very comfortable  Clamping pressure on the head is snug not uncomfortable in any way  Of course this will vary so try them if you can  Great grade of sheep skin leather with a great smell to them  The case soft leather  It is unique but not the most protective but good enough  They do not fold flat but to the side for storage keep that in mind  If you want a headphone that will last you many years if not for life consider these  They may be expensive but think of it like this you can get many standard headphones with moderate success at a decent experience but lack durability to take any form of traveling or you can buy one phenomenal pair of headphones audiophile grade and love them for many years to come 
This is a great remote and very easy to use  Programming is easy as well 
I had a 1100 remote the battery went and was unable to buy another battery for that remote they discontinued that model  In I purchased the new Ultimate One  It s a oustanding remote so easy to set up bright screen and easy to use   
I purchased a Surface Pro 3 last year  The weakest link of the product was the type cover  The trackpad was too small and the keys were too close together  This new type cover changes the game  The trackpad larger and more responsive  I no longer have to carry a wireless mouse around  The keys are better spaced and the fingerprint reader makes unlocking the system a breeze  This cover is also backwards compatible with Pro 3   4  I did take away one star because there is still no where to store the pen  Otherwise I think this is a must upgrade for any surface pro 3 owner  It greatly improves the usability of the product 
This Ultimate One is a great improvement over our older Harmony 880 remote  Programing is much easier and its simpler design makes it a lot easier to use  My only minor issues with it are that the touch screen is sensitive which makes it more likely to accidentally call for something when handling it  Also  the IR beam must be fairly narrow  so the remote has to be pointed with some care to activate the appropriate devices  I bought mine on sale as factory refreshed for about half the normal price it looks brand new and seems to work perfectly 
These headphones sound amazing and the noise cancelling is second only to bose  I d wager  The bass isn t that strong  but most can live without it  My only gripe with these is that they are modern on your ears  Not painful  so to speak  but the pressure of the ear cups is definitely uncomfortable after about 15 minutes 
The mount is a very solid product and supports the TV nicely 
This TV was advertised as an  out of the box  special  The only flaw in the set was some of the black paint was worn off the stand  The set it s self is great  and the ordering process and in store pickup was easy 
The quality of sound and the extra bass makes this an extraordinary speaker 
My 2 1  2 year old Dell XPS 8700 suddenly went south  defective motherboard  and Best Buy had this XPS 8920 floor demo on sale at a very reasonable price  So I went for it  The machine is just fine  Faster than my previous model  And I can t speak highly enough about Best Buy s compassion by its technical staff for my plight  nor the wonderful support they provide  The best I ve ever experienced in my long experiences as a geek  But this was a forced purchase  my older XPS 8700 was doing everything I needed or wanted it to do  So spending any money on a replacement was a drag  Thank goodness for Best Buy  They were there when I needed them  And that is the most important thing of all 
This is a nice looking and very dependable weather radio  I returned it because I didn t notice when I bought it that it lacked an FM radio asa well  I did order a midland radio with both weather and AM  FM radio 
I shopped around for miniDV tapes for a while before trying these  They re priced competitively 
I love this remote  I was using my smartphone with the My Harmony app and Hub to control my devices  which worked great  I just didn t like the impact the app had on my phone s battery  but this remote solved that problem for me 
a good TV                                         
This speaker works well for the price and does have a good sound 
I never have one of before  But it seems like I can do a lot of stuff with this and walk around the house with this in my hand 
A good idea that works well enough  but switches slowly  possesses suspect build quality and ultimately breaks  I m on my 2nd Harmony remote  two different models  in two and a half years  The latest became a brick after I tried correcting the hour minute readout  I rebooted  only to have the device migrate to  freeze  mode  Additional reboots yielded the same result  Logitech s on line help directed me to remove reinstall the battery  which is a real pain in the keester  Same result Another electronics manufacturer needs to compete in this segment  Logitech is ripe for picking  Unfortunately  I ll probably go to Best Buy again and buy another Harmony  The convenience is too compelling  I just wish      
Not real replacement but a good choice for this price  Our family like it 
Over all   the material and designs are great   I found a great home for my great camera  
I bought the flipside 300 for my Nikon D 7000  I now use with my D7200  Depending on where I am going and what I will be shooting  I carry different lenses  I have no trouble putting my camera and kit lens in this bag  I can also put a 70 300mm in also  Although a little tight I can put my camera with battery grip and a 150 600mm lens in it  I have found the flipside 300 to be well built  The materials and workmanship is second to none  I like the ability to move the dividers inside to suit my needs 
Bought this stereo last Christmas and have been reasonably satisfied so far  Had a couple of Kenwoods before that that were junk  The controls were really complicated and hard to see and the signal reception was poor  Overall pretty lousy machines  I picked this particular brand because of its ability to grab stations and hold on to them which is a necessity in north GA where signals fade in and out all the time because of the moutains  One complaint  The channel knob is made of ridiculously cheap plastic  thin plastic  Hope it holds up  We ll see 
I bought this obviously to watch my pets  One of them has been digging at some trim and I wanted to see who it was  I have witnessed the culprit and am able to talk with her to get her to stop  I have been using for 2 weeks now  almost daily  When I go to work is my main concern  but have tried even while out shopping  dining etc  The picture has always been crystal clear  however  it does switch between black and white and color  Not sure why but it s not a major issue for me  You can can hear them or mute them  speak with them  check on the room temperature  it has night vision that works in the complete darkness and still get a nice picture  They also will save the recordings for you for a small fee  They give 7 days free  My only dissatisfaction with this product is that you cannot raise the volume on the camera itself and I feel it s a little on the low side  I do know the dogs can hear me when I speak to them  There are 2 holes in the bottom to mount  but the way I would really like to mount it turns the camera upside down and the picture stays that way  it won t right itself  I m satisfied with this little camera and has done what I need it to do  When I have to be away from the pups I can still check in on them and talk with them  It has actually put me at ease and given me a little peace of mind  I can see that they are doing well  have water  they are playing and most importantly that they are safe and peaceful  My boss made a good point today as well  The direction the camera faces happens to be my front door  so I can see if anyone breaks in or if there should be a fire or some dangerous situation  I will know in real time 
I bought this to replace a first generation Harmony One   I prefer the old Harmony s user interface   more real buttons   the new Ultimate also has odd touch screen responses   jumps home theatre set up without logical step   i e  mine will jump from playing a Bluray to CD playback just altering the Home Theatre processor  IT is a decent multi device remote  I sense drive to reduce cost by going to more multi purpose soft switches is just annoying to this old timer  However one VERY positive input   LOGITECH s support group   they go the EXTRA mile to resolve issues  quickly  proficiently  very comforting to know they are available and driven to serve 
I loved that the Harmony allowed me to setup activities that would make it easy to make sure the right device was on and the right sound  video sources were selected  Most of the time it worked seamlessly and it was easy to go in and change or update settings  What I did not like about the Harmony was the antiquated computer application  for as much money as Logitech has made they can afford to do a much better job   I dreaded the finish on the back of the remotes    it feels literally like nails on a chalkboard and my Harmony  all emit a high pitched squealing noise when the displays are turned on  It s not loud per say  but the fact that it s so high pitched it is very noticeable and annoying considering the proximity you d have to have the remote from your body to use it  and it s there anytime the display is on   It s also worth noting that the battery life on these is terrible  in most cases it can t go more than two days off the charging base   For the ease of setup  use and functionality  I d recommend it to someone looking to simplify their home theater setup and get rid of the 3 4  remotes the average person has  For myself  I would probably not purchase this model again 
This is the worst product I ve ever bought  I have two different computers  one Windows  and the other a Mac  Both have the compatible operating systems with which to set up this remote  Unfortunately even after spending well over an hour with a Logitech support person I was unable to get into the set up page  on either computer  The Logitech web site is ambiguous and extremely un user friendly  I m good with computers and have never had an issue with any other device  but this one is simply poorly designed  with poor software  and even though the support person was trying  they simply had no clue either  Save your money  and buy a non Logitech universal remote  and will save the unbelievable headaches of this compete waste of money 
These headphones pair immediately with bluetooth equipment  fold up with a carry bag for easy portability  and have a nice  clear sound  These are a great deal compared to the cost of some of the bluetooth headphones on the market 
This was a bit tedious at first to set up but well worth the trouble During initial setup be sure to touch the fingerprint reader repeatedly as you move your finger around in multiple positions to improve the interface s ability to recognize you Sometimes will not recognize fingerprint  just be sure touch window is kept very clean Only Drawback   the COLOR    ONLY available in Black  I really preferred the dark Blue option available in the new keypad for Surface Pro 4  but having the fingerprint interface adds a bit of a WOW factor  
A bit small for my fingers but excellent product to have
These headphones were a little expensive  but they were worth it considering I use all features  The Bluetooth is great for getting things done around the house  but I m not sure how accurate JBL s statement on the range is  It charges super fast and the on eat control pads make everything easier  I also utilize the audio cable and get the same great sound  Excellent product overall 
All the features of the SP3 type cover that I had issues with are either dramatically improved or solved with this  The keys are great  and the extra spacing does cut down on errors  The trackpad is much improved It s incredibly responsive and feels great  The addition of a print screen button is key as well  not sure how they missed that the first time around  The only thing I wish it had  did better is to have a little more rigidity  The rigidity  and thus lapability  is the same as the SP3 type cover  so not 100 improved   The new feature of the finger print scanner is nice  and it works incredibly well when it recognizes my finger  I was able to set it up without any issues on my SP3  I am  however  disappointed in how often it fails to recognize my fingerprint though  I ve ended up getting in with my picture password several times  about 50 of the time  
Adding memory to 2009 iMac significantly improved performance the original iMac late 2009 with 4 GB RAM after installing High Sierra was so slow  I was thinking of buying a new computer  After adding 8 GB RAM I reconsidered new one  The performance is acceptable  Apple can wait for another year 
JBL does great sound in this size of speakers also 
It s got a great sound  Loving the bass and all features  It worth every penny 
These inexexpensive little heels give me the same found as the Hess 2 without the size and weight
love this remote  i could finally set aside the 5 i have to just use this one 
Using this with a Sony BD player and Onkyo 5 1 amp linked via coax audio TV via HDMI  After all settings were completed  the action and big explosions sounded great  If you listen to movies using TV speakers  you don t know what you re missing BUT I couldn t hear dialog  Checked all settings  and searched online forums  I tried to boost the dB for the center but still couldn t hear  Speakers are connected via Monster Cable instead of the flimsy speaker cable provided  so small the connectors won t even hold it   Then I used the test tone from the amp to find out the center channel speaker doesn t work  I m using an existing bookshelf speaker for center for now Otherwise  the bases sound fine and rest of the speakers seem more than powerful enough for my tiny home theater room  Watched Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3 D with 6 year old  and the combination 3 D video and 3 D audio were a winner with him For a small room  with a decent amp and proper cables  do yourself a favor  and get at least 16 gauge  this set should work just fine for most movie lovers  Audiophiles should look elsewhere  And test all speakers before you throw out the packaging  as I did  UPDATE  after mentioning to Amazon the center channel was not working but I didn t want to pack everything up  they promptly shipped me a new set FOC   with pre paid return as well  Next day  New center channel works great  and sound has greatly improved  Nicely done UPDATE 02  17  2012  3 years later   Have had absolutely no issues with this speaker set  I just purchased a new Onkyo receiver and was looking for additional speakers  because they have held up so well  My family enjoys watching movies and we use these at least 30 hours a week Read more

Worthless device under warranty  Logitech will not replace
Three units in a row had different issues  One had a bad touch screen  one had a bad right direction button sticking  and one did not sync to the Logitech hub  All verified of having issues by Best Buy and Logitech  This is within a 3 5 day period of running back and forth to Best Buy  These returns put me on a no return list for a undefined period  Customers suffers for manufactures defects  In dispute right now  No more Harmony remotes or Best Buy for me  
2 pack 8gb Pc4 19200  This Ram fit in my XPS 8900 Dell  Bought the extra Ram for Gaming  Started with 8gb added this and now 24gb 
This memory only ran at 2133mhz if you can find some it will run between 2133 to 2400  But no faster For you info Fast as ram can go is just about 2400mhz  NO matter what the package says  Search on youtube for something like how fast is computer memory really  Dont pay for 4000mhz BS RAM  no such thing 
We just purchased these for my son  He looked at all the headphone and felt like these where more comfortable and sounded better then the Beats  He loves them  Good quality 
I had an issue and you guys handled it ASAP and I am very happy with my purchase  Thank you

This was the second remote of this type I ve purchased and both are great 
I had problems getting the lights to flash fast at first with the Bluetooth but then notice that I had to put up the volume on my phone up to like 80 to have them flash faster  the sound is really good  just what you would expect from sony 
Dont spend your money on these the sound quality is not as good as the cheap OEMs  The speakers sound very poor no bass and I had the polarity correct used the little Metra speaker harness they worked great 
My husband is a remote snob and this one he loved  All you need at the touch of a finger 
It works okay except for when I turn the volume up it sounds like the sound backfeeds through the stereo is there a fix for this thank you

I had high expectations for the srs hg1 and this little guy didn t disappoint  It s touted as the world s smallest hi res speaker  and I ll keep my praise focused on its ability to handle hi res  in the case of this speaker  a ceiling of 24 bit by 96 kHz  audio files  I ve listened to a number of albums recorded at lower quality  the standard 16  44 256k variety  through it  and the speaker still sounds excellent for its size  but the H ear go really sings when paired with a hi res capable source One significant trick up Sony s kimono is the ability to sync with their proprietary LDAC Bluetooth codec  LDAC allows wireless transmission of up to 900 kbps  and it sounds noticeably superior to aptx or sbc Bluetooth standards  Of course  you need a device capable of pushing LDAC  such as the NWZ Walkman players  or Xperia Z5 and later Sony smart phones  and a hi res audio file to hear the LDAC effect  I m syncing with the NWZ A17 silver and Xperia Z5 phone  and they both sound amazing when paired with this speaker  A further feature of the H ear go is the ability to connect via micro USB to your PC  at which point the H ear go bypasses the sound card of your computer  using its own DAC to play hi res files  I ve tried this as well  and the quality is impressive Perhaps you are not into hi res music and you don t own a bunch of Sony kit  Well  I still think you still will be very pleased with the H ear go  It s a great sounding portable speaker with great battery life and connectivity options  200 is a reasonable price for this unit  Personally  I m angling to pick up a second one so I can experience the stereo sound and multi room features that pairing two or more of these speakers will provide Read more
Bought it for my bf for valentine s day and he is having  still 3 months later  a great deal of problems connecting it to his TV  Might be too advanced for some TVs so beware of this when purchasing it 
The stand I got was the mid stand with the 2 wide legs coming from the center which was PERFECT and exactly what i wanted  Great TV and super awesome quality so far I give it a 5 
Perfect awl mount for my new 65 curved TV  Very satisfied  *****
I haven t had any trouble with it yet  
The remote control is quite smart and straightforward  I like the lcd as the access point to your gadgets to control  The remote control activate itself as soon as you touch it and i liked the shot gestures like turning volume up or down just to mention one of the few  The only thing I didn t like is the permanent battery  It can not be replaced by the user but as long as you keep it in the charger  stand you will be just fine  I have five remote controls before but only one now 
This remote is the master of all universal remotes  This remote will turn on all items within one button  Also the battery lasts so long  This product is great  If this remote lets you down in any way then it s because your broke it  
Just don t  Go with something that at least looks sharp if you have money to blow  These Bluetooth headphones don t come with their own USB transceiver and the microphone is designed for a phone only and won t work with a USB adapter and Skype  The sound is actually muffled and has less depth than my  50 Logitech Bluetooth headset  If you do want to plug them in and use the cord  the cord that comes with them wouldn t reach to my pants pocket and it uses a non standard connector  The first pair I got bricked when I paired it with my PC  In the end  I returned the replacement because it was such a huge disappointment  I was really looking forward to noise canceling headphones but the noise canceling just adds a layer of random white noise to your music that changes in volume based on the ambient noise  It doesn t seem to cancel anything  it just has this annoying hum that changes volume with whatever is going on around you  I was REALLY disappointed with these headphones  They could have at least made them LOOK fancy   
Does it all  can watch any home TV program remotely
Once you program the remote it will do everything you want and the best part is that you can control all your a  v equipment with just one control Best remote I have ever owned 
Produces good stereo sound
Some of our streaming channels have low audio issues and the TV alone wasn t enough
Pulls in signals better than most weather radios  even other Midland models   The radio was even used on a road trip and alerted all of the severe weather in the area
These tapes are hard to find
Easy and efficient way to control television
Great sound in a small package
Easy to turn off and on
Excellent fidelity
this keyboard works great with the surface pro 4
These are good speakers and I highly recommend them  They have lots of power
Works relatively well
This is our first high tech remote control and it s easy to use
Good bag  Bad bestbuy service  They were unable to privenatch this one with Amazon  Sold by Amazon directly
It s a good keyboard  I like the fingerprint reader
Sound quality is good  Headphones tend to press in on head and ears when used over extended periods
I love this remote
I purchased this after Thanksgiving
I purchased both the JBL GX862 and the Kicker CS68 I run a sound system so I m picky about my music and these two speakers are night and day in sound output The JBL is more realisitic and life like sound vs  the tinny high pitch no mids and no bass sound that comes out of the Kickers  I was very surprised to hear the poor output of the Kickers as I have always thought more highly of them until now  If you are replacing your stock speakers you won t get a lot more base
Samdisla  Easy to Mount
I was really happy with this purchase
Great picture
Have not had to use this product yet
This new jetpack keeps turning off after charging  Doesn t work for my Ring Video Doorbell when I m on vacation
I m not sure what all i can say about a hard drive  It does what it needs to and and what I expect of it
Have two of these for my MicroServer   no issues at all  Low power consumption while idle and seem to work well with ESXi 
I have some of these drives in my HP microserver at home and they have been faultless Very quick  reliable and reasonably priced 
I love the WD Red line  I have used all sizes  1TB  2TB  3TB  4TB  6TB in various NAS units  They all have held up well and I would recommend them at any time
